{"title": "The role-based access control system of a European bank: a case study and discussion\n", "abstract": " Research in the area of role-based access control has made fast progress over the last few years. However, little has been done to identify and describe existing role-based access control systems within large organisations. This paper describes the access control system of a major European Bank. An overview of the systems structure, its administration and existing control principles constraining the administration is given. In addition, we provide an answer to a key question-the ratio of the number of roles to the system user population-which was raised in the recent RBAC2000 Workshop. Having described certain weaknesses of the Banks system, the case study is extended to a comparison between the system and the RBAC96 models.

With each print action the local unit counter on the attached dongle is decreased and in parallel a unit counter is maintained in the Hyperledger-based blockchain. Once a threshold is met, the printer will stop working (by means of the cryptographically protected invocation of the local print method). The blockchain is configured in such a way that chaincode is executed to increase the units again automatically (and essentially trigger any payment processes). Once this has happened, the new unit counter value will be passed from the blockchain to the local dongle and thus allow for further execution of print jobs.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["362"]}

This is done in the context of a real-world banking business process requiring static and dynamic separation of duty properties as well as delegation of task instances. This paper extends earlier work we have done in this area [6]. In particular, we now present a more structured analysis approach covering the inter-and intra-relationships between business process definitions and their instances. A fundamental notion is that of a business object which may be manipulated by one or several principals over multiple business process definitions and instances.

{"title": "Annotating Business Processes with Usage Controls\n", "abstract": " Complex Supply Chain interactions provide an ideal example of interconnected physical and logical assets that require protection. More specifically, we observe an increasing demand for specifying and enforcing usage control policies within supply chains, relating to both physical+ as well as logical assets.In this paper we will highlight some possible usage control scenarios. We will present our existing control visualization framework to position the identified usage controls in the more general context of safety and security controls. We provide an indepth discussion of the key constructs of our model and how they can be used to specify and visualize usage controls.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["362"]}
{"title": "A Distributed Access Control Framework For XML Document Centric Collaborations\n", "abstract": " Collaboratively working on documents within a distributed context is a non-trivial task, in particular if neither a centralized access control policy enforcement platform nor a centralized document repository can be assumed to be present. Decoupling the specification of the access control policy of documents from its later autonomous enforcement can make it easier to edit documents in a decentralized yet secure fashion. This paper introduces a distributed and fine grained access control framework for XML document centric collaborations. The framework addresses the authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, and traceability of circulated documents and their updates. It is fully distributed in that each participant can enforce and verify these security properties without relying on a central authority.Novel aspects of the proposed framework include the adoption of a decentralized key management scheme that provides support for the cryptographic enforcement of a credential based access control policy. This scheme is driven by the access interests expressed by the participants over document parts. A protocol for the controlled edition of a document is finally introduced based on these techniques.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["362"]}

{"title": "Industrial Feasibility of Private Information Retrieval.\n", "abstract": " A popular security problem in database management is how to guarantee to a querying party that the database owner will not learn anything about the data that is retrieved\u2014a problem known as Private Information Retrieval (PIR). While a variety of PIR schemes are known, they are rarely considered for practical use cases yet. We investigate the feasibility of PIR in the telecommunications world to open up data of carriers to external parties. To this end, we first provide a comparative survey of the current PIR state of the art (including ORAM schemes as a generalized concept) as well as implementation and analysis of two PIR schemes for the considered use case. While an overall conclusion is that PIR techniques are not too far away from practical use in specific cases, we see ORAM as a more suitable candidate for further R&D investment.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["362"]}

Specifically, providing a distributed XML content dissemination services in a selective and secure fashion is a challenging task. This paper proposes a publish/subscribe infrastructure to disseminate enterprise XML content utilizing document semantics. Our approach relies on the dissemination of XML documents based on their content, as described by ontology concepts that form the basis for an interoperable description of XML documents. This infrastructure leverages our earlier encryption enabled document parsing [20] scheme for protecting the integrity and confidentiality of XML content during dissemination.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["362"]}
{"title": "A Secure Comparison Technique for Tree Structured Data\n", "abstract": " Comparing different versions of large tree structured data is a CPU and memory intensive task. State of the art techniques require the complete XML trees and their internal representations to be loaded into memory before any comparison may start. Furthermore, comparing sanitized XML trees is not addressed by these techniques. We propose a comparison technique for sanitized XML documents which ultimately results into a minimum cost edit script transforming the initial tree into the target tree. This method uses encrypted integer labels to encode the original XML structure and content, making the encrypted XML readable only by a legitimate party. Encoded tree nodes can be compared by a third party with a limited intermediate representation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["362"]}
{"title": "A Framework for Seamless and Compliant Service Consumption in Outsourcing Scenarios\n", "abstract": " The ability to support the outsourcing of parts of a business process has become a major requirement within enterprise information systems (EIS). If, however, certain procedural or technical constraints derived from compliance regulations have been specified on parts of such a process we face the problem of maintaining such constraints in outsourcing scenarios as well. In this paper we describe a technique and architectural support for flexible outsourcing of process steps at runtime, at the same time supporting the service provider in delivering the required evidence regarding his compliant handling of the outsourced artefacts. We demonstrate the augmentation of business processes with compliance constraints for later model-driven and automated generation of security and configuration policies. An architecture is then presented detailing the working of a compliance-centric service gateway, supporting the outsourcing of constrained activities irrespective of the service provider\u2019s EIS landscape.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["362"]}

Salaman et al. argue that \u201cControl means that members of the organisation have their actions,[..] determined, or influenced, by membership of the organisation.\u201d[19].

{"title": "A workflow instance-based model-checking approach to analysing organisational controls in a loan origination process\n", "abstract": " Demonstrating the safety of a system (ie. avoiding the undesired propagation of access rights or indirect access through some other granted resource) is one of the goals of access control research, eg [1-4]. However, the flexibility required from enterprise resource management (ERP) systems may require the implementation of seemingly contradictory requirements (eg tight access control but at the same time support for discretionary delegation of workflow tasks and rights). To aid in the analysis of safety problems in workflow-based ERP systems, this paper presents a model-checking based approach for automated analysis of delegation and revocation functionalities. This is done in the context of a real-world banking workflow. We expand on some of our earlier work reported in [44], which was restricted to single workflow models and not arbitrary workflow instances of one or several models. This initial restriction to model-checking at the workflow model level meant that we were not able to analyse delegation and revocation of tasks and access rights in the detail as required in some of our earlier conceptual models [11, 12]. We derived information about the workflow from BPEL specifications and ERP business object repositories. This was captured in a SMV specification together with a definition of possible delegation and revocation scenarios. Possibly required separation of duty properties were translated into a set of LTL-based constraints.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["362"]}
