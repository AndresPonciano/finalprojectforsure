{"title": "Mirror adaptive random testing (Journal)\n", "abstract": " Recently, adaptive random testing (ART) has been introduced to improve the fault-detection effectiveness of random testing for non-point types of failure patterns. However, ART requires additional computations to ensure an even spread of test cases, which may render ART less cost-effective than random testing. This paper presents a new technique, namely mirror ART, to reduce these computations. It is an integration of the technique of mirroring and ART. Our simulation results clearly show that mirror ART does improve the cost-effectiveness of ART.", "num_citations": "168\n", "authors": ["1144"]}
{"title": "A Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for Covering Array Generation\n", "abstract": " Software behavior depends on many factors. Combinatorial testing (CT) aims to generate small sets of test cases to uncover defects caused by those factors and their interactions. Covering array generation, a discrete optimization problem, is the most popular research area in the field of CT. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary search-based heuristic technique, has succeeded in generating covering arrays that are competitive in size. However, current PSO methods for covering array generation simply round the particle's position to an integer to handle the discrete search space. Moreover, no guidelines are available to effectively set PSOs parameters for this problem. In this paper, we extend the set-based PSO, an existing discrete PSO (DPSO) method, to covering array generation. Two auxiliary strategies (particle reinitialization and additional evaluation of gbest) are proposed to improve\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "80\n", "authors": ["1144"]}
{"title": "Contributions of tester experience and a checklist guideline to the identification of categories and choices for software testing\n", "abstract": " An early step for most black-box testing methods is to identify a set of categories and choices (or their equivalents) from the specification. The identification is often performed in an ad hoc manner, thus the quality of categories and choices is in doubt. Poorly identified categories and choices will affect the comprehensiveness of test cases. In this paper, we describe several comparative studies using three commercial specifications and discuss the major results. The objectives of our studies are (a) to investigate the differences in the types and amounts of mistakes made between inexperienced and experienced software testers in an ad hoc identification approach and (b) to determine the extent of mistake reduction after discussing the mistakes with the software testers and providing them with an identification checklist.", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1144"]}
{"title": "On adaptive random testing\n", "abstract": " Adaptive random testing (ART) has been proposed as an enhancement to random testing for situations where failure-causing inputs are clustered together. The basic idea of ART is to evenly spread test cases throughout the input domain. It has been shown by simulations and empirical analysis that ART frequently outperforms random testing. However, there are some outstanding issues on the cost-effectiveness and practicality of ART, which are the main foci of this thesis. Firstly, this thesis examines the basic factors that have an impact on the faultdetection effectiveness of adaptive random testing, and identifies favourable and unfavourable conditions for ART. Our study concludes that favourable conditions for ART occur more frequently than unfavourable conditions. Secondly, since all previous studies allow duplicate test cases, there has been a concern whether adaptive random testing performs better than random testing because ART uses fewer duplicate test cases. This thesis confirms that it is the even spread rather than less duplication of test cases which makes ART perform better than RT. Given that the even spread is the main pillar of the success of ART, an investigation has been conducted to study the relevance and appropriateness of several existing metrics of even spreading. Thirdly, the practicality of ART has been challenged for nonnumeric or high dimensional input domains. This thesis provides solutions that address these concerns. Finally, a new problem solving technique, namely, mirroring, has been developed. The integration of mirroring with adaptive random testing has been empirically shown to significantly increase the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1144"]}
{"title": "Combinatorial testing, random testing, and adaptive random testing for detecting interaction triggered failures\n", "abstract": " Context Software behavior depends on many factors, and some failures occur only when certain factors interact. This is known as an interaction triggered failure, and the corresponding selection of factor values can be modeled as a Minimal Failure-causing Schema (MFS).(An MFS involving m factors is an m-MFS.) Combinatorial Testing (CT) has been developed to exercise (\u201chit\u201d) all MFS with few tests. Adaptive Random Resting (ART) endeavors to make tests as different as possible, ensuring that testing of MFS is not unnecessarily repeated. Random Testing (RT) chooses tests at random without regard to the MFS already treated. CT might be expected to improve on RT for finding interaction triggered faults, and yet some studies report no significant difference. CT can also be expected to be better than ART, and yet other studies report that ART can be much better than RT.

{"title": "On Testing Effectiveness of Metamorphic Relations: A Case Study\n", "abstract": " One fundamental challenge for software testing is the oracle problem, which means that either there does not exist a mechanism (called oracle) to verify the test output given any possible program input, or it is very expensive, if not impossible, to apply the oracle. Metamorphic testing is an innovative approach to oracle problem. In metamorphic testing, metamorphic relations are derived from the innate characteristics of the software under test. These relations can help to generate test data and verify the correctness of the test result without the need of oracle. The effectiveness of metamorphic relations can play a significant role in the testing process. It has been argued that the metamorphic relations that cause different software execution behaviors should have high fault detection ability.

{"title": "Test Suite Prioritization by Switching Cost\n", "abstract": " Test suite generation and prioritization are two main research fields to improve testing efficiency. Combinatorial testing has been proven as an effective method to generate test suite for highly configurable software systems, while test suites are often prioritized by interaction coverage to detect faults as early as possible. However, for some cases, there exists reasonable cost of reconfiguring parameter settings when switching test cases in different orders. Surprisingly, only few studies paid attention to it. In this paper, by proposing greedy algorithms and graph-based algorithms, we aim to prioritize a given test suite to minimize its total switching cost. We also compare two different prioritization strategies by a series of experiments, and discuss the advantages of our prioritization strategy and the selection of prioritization techniques. The results show that prioritization by switching cost can improve testing efficiency and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1144"]}

It has been observed that the compactness of failure regions is one of the factors that affect the performance of ART. However, this relationship has only been verified with rectangular failure regions. This paper further investigates the relationship between the compactness of failure regions and the performance of ART by conducting simulation experiments, where various regular and irregular failure regions are studied.

{"title": "Testing a Software-based PID Controller Using Metamorphic Testing\n", "abstract": " The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is ubiquitous in industrial and military systems. Almost all PID controllers are now implemented as software in a microcontroller. Control systems are required to have very high reliability, particularly as they are regularly used in safety-critical systems. An effective testing technique is essential to achieve reliable PID controller software. Unlike simple control algorithms, PID controllers are capable of manipulating the process inputs based on the history and rate of change of the signal. It is very difficult to know whether the computation of the software is correct from the computed outputs. Previous research in other areas has shown that metamorphic testing is an effective technique for this kind of problem. In this paper, we examine metamorphic testing in the context of testing an embedded software PID controller based on the free sample code from ATMEL Corporation. We show that metamorphic testing killed all mutants inserted into the controller software, demonstrating the utility of the technique in testing control systems.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1144"]}

Firstly, the indicator values are updated with real-time market data that cannot be generated arbitrarily. Secondly, technical indicators are computed based on a large amount of market data. Thus, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to derive the expected indicator values to check the correctness of the computed indicator values.

Our previous studies show that switching cost can affect the efficiency of testing.ObjectiveIn this paper, we aim to identify the optimal testing order that can detect interaction triggered faults earlier in the presence switching cost.MethodWe presented a distance based metric to measure the switching cost between test cases. As reducing the switching cost can make the whole test suite run faster and thus achieve full combination coverage earlier, single-objective algorithms were used to minimize the total switching cost.

{"title": "A Cost-driven Approach for Metamorphic Testing\n", "abstract": " Metamorphic testing has been applied in various systems from different domains. Many studies showed that the selection of metamorphic relations greatly affected the effectiveness of metamorphic testing. However, these studies mainly focused on the fault-detection effectiveness. They did not consider the cost that metamorphic relations involved, such as the number of test inputs. Good metamorphic relations should have high fault-detection effectiveness with a low cost. In this paper, we propose a cost-driven approach for metamorphic testing. The key idea is to design metamorphic relations sharing the same test inputs to reduce the testing cost. We conduct a case study on a bank system and compare the cost-effectiveness of metamorphic relations derived from this approach and those constructed by the conventional approach. The experimental results show that metamorphic relations derived from our approach are more cost-effective. We also find that this approach not only reduces the cost of metamorphic testing, but also helps to construct different metamorphic relations to detect different types of faults.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1144"]}

Hence, the charting components could be poorly tested before being integrated into software.

{"title": "Dynamic Test Profiles in Adaptive Random Testing: A Case Study\n", "abstract": " Random testing (RT) is a basic software testing method. When used to detect software failures, RT usually generates random test cases according to a uniform distribution. Adaptive random testing (ART) is an innovative approach to enhancing the failure-detection capability of RT. Most ART algorithms are composed of two independent processes, namely the candidate generation process and the test case identification process. In these ART algorithms, some program inputs are first randomly generated as the test case candidates; then test cases are identified from these candidates in order to ensure an even spread of test cases across the input domain. Most previous studies on ART focused on the enhancement of the test case identification process, while using the uniform distribution in the candidate generation process. A recent study has shown that using a dynamic test profile in the candidate generation process can also improve the failure-detection capability of ART. In this paper, we develop various test profiles and integrate them with the test case identification process of a particular ART algorithm, namely fixedsize-candidate-set ART. It is observed that all these test profiles can significantly improve the failure-detection capability of ART.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1144"]}
{"title": "Eliminating Human Visual Judgment from Testing of Financial Charting Software\n", "abstract": " Financial charting software is widely used in share, commodity and foreign currency exchange markets to visualize and analyze price movements. Its quality is critical because incorrect outputs may lead to wrong analysis and trading decisions, and consequently substantial financial losses. Human visual judgment is often required to test financial charting software because of the graphical complexity of software outputs and limited knowledge of expected outputs. Such approach is labour intensive and error-prone. In this paper, we propose an automated testing technique combining metamorphic testing, assertion checking and a novel data label extraction method to eliminate human visual judgment from testing financial charting software. We used this technique to test pre-release builds of a commercial Point and Figure charting software component, and demonstrated that the proposed technique can effectively detect actual faults in the software component. Further, we discuss how the technique can be extended to test other charting software components.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1144"]}
