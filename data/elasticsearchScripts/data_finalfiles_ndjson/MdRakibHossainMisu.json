{"title": "Interface driven code clone detection\n", "abstract": " Code cloning is a common code reusing technique that occurs when developers replicate similar pieces of code fragments within or between software repositories. Another replication happens when developers repeat method interfaces (i.e., method name, return and parameter types). Two methods are prone to be cloned when those have similar interfaces and perform similar functionalities. Considering this, a new lightweight Interface Driven Code Clone Detection (IDCCD) technique is proposed, that can detect clones by using method interface similarities. First, the method blocks are tokenized from the source files. For those method block tokens, interface information is extracted and indexed with mapped tokens. Then, similar interfaces are queried from that index and compared those with a similarity function for detecting clones. IDCCD is evaluated with other state of the art techniques by using BigCloneEval\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["827"]}
{"title": "An exploratory study on interface similarities in code clones\n", "abstract": " Code cloning is one of the most popular code reusing techniques where similar pieces of code are replicated within or between code repositories. Interface similarity is a kind of replication that refers to the similarity of method names, return types and parameter types which repeat across the code repositories. Two methods with similar interfaces are prone to be cloned if those perform analogous functions either entirely or at least partially. An exploratory study is performed in this paper, to explore the relationship and effects of interface similarity in code clones. It is investigated that interface similarity can be helpful for code clone detection. First, clone methods are detected in code repositories. Then, interface information is extracted from source code and several interface similarities are measured using that information. The experimental corpus contains three different types of code repositories with 35, 109 and 24\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["827"]}
