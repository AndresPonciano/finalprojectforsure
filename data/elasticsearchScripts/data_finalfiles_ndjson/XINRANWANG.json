{"title": "SDAP: A secure hop-by-hop data aggregation protocol for sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Hop-by-hop data aggregation is a very important technique for reducing the communication overhead and energy expenditure of sensor nodes during the process of data collection in a sensor network. However, because individual sensor readings are lost in the per-hop aggregation process, compromised nodes in the network may forge false values as the aggregation results of other nodes, tricking the base station into accepting spurious aggregation results. Here a fundamental challenge is how can the base station obtain a good approximation of the fusion result when a fraction of sensor nodes are compromised? To answer this challenge, we propose SDAP, a Secure Hop-by-hop Data Aggregation Protocol for sensor networks. SDAP is a general-purpose secure data aggregation protocol applicable to multiple aggregation functions.

{"title": "Amino acid availability regulates p70 S6 kinase and multiple translation factors\n", "abstract": " Incubation of Chinese hamster ovary cells without amino acids for up to 60\u00a0min caused a rapid marked decrease in p70 S6 kinase activity and increased binding of initiation factor eIF4E to its inhibitory regulator protein 4E-BP1. This was associated with dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E and dissociation of eIF4E from eIF4G. All these effects were rapidly reversed by resupplying a mixture of amino acids and this was blocked by rapamycin and by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, implying a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in the signalling pathway linking amino acids with the control of p70 S6 kinase activity and the phosphorylation of these translation factors. Amino acid withdrawal also led to changes in the phosphorylation of other translation factors; phosphorylation of eIF4E decreased whereas elongation factor eEF2 became more heavily phosphorylated, each of these changes being\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "383\n", "authors": ["331"]}

{"title": "Distributed software-based attestation for node compromise detection in sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Sensors that operate in an unattended, harsh or hostile environment are vulnerable to compromises because their low costs preclude the use of expensive tamper-resistant hardware. Thus, an adversary may reprogram them with malicious code to launch various insider attacks.

These schemes are based on a pseudorandom noise generation mechanism and a lightweight block-based pseudorandom memory traversal algorithm. Each node is loaded with pseudorandom noise in its empty program memory before deployment, and later on multiple neighbors of a suspicious node collaborate to verify the integrity of the code running on this node in a distributed manner.

A sample set of 456 individuals selected from 140 stands were genotyped with 15 SSR loci. Over all loci each individual was identified with unique multilocus genotype. High genetic diversity (average He= 0.820) and low population differentiation (FST= 0.0087) characterized this material. Although low in FST, the two northernmost populations were clustered as a distinct group diverged from the central populations. The population differentiation pattern corresponds well with the post glacial migration history of Norway spruce and the current gene flow and human activity in the region. The average inbreeding coefficient was 0.084 after removal loci with high frequency of null alleles. The estimated relatedness of the trees gathered in the breeding populations was very low (average kinship coefficient 0.0077) and not structured.

The present study aimed to quantify \u03b2-cell secretory function independently of insulin sensitivity in the context of differential metabolic clearance rates of insulin (MCRI) in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Insulin secretion rate (ISR) was derived from deconvolution of serial C-peptide concentrations measured during a 5 stage graded glucose infusion (GGI) in 12 nondiabetic (N), 8 prediabetic or dysmetabolic (DYS) and 4 overtly diabetic (DM) cynomolgus monkeys. The characterization of the monkeys was based on the fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, glucose clearance rate measured by intravenous glucose tolerance test, and insulin resistance indices measured in separate experiments. The molar ratio of C-peptide/insulin (C/I) was used as a surrogate index of hepatic MCRI. Compared to the N monkeys, the DYS with normal glycemia and hyperinsulinemia had significantly higher basal and GGI-induced elevation of insulin and C-peptide concentrations and lower C/I, however, each unit of glucose-stimulated ISR increment was not significantly different from that in the N monkeys. In contrast, the DM monkeys with \u03b2-cell failure and hyperglycemia had a depressed GGI-stimulated ISR response and elevated C/I.

This work mainly shows the calculated polarizer mirror settings as a function of the injection angles for pure second extraordinary harmonic mode coupling.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Many websites are vulnerable to automated attacks. Basic anti-automation countermeasures such as Turing tests provide minimal efficacy and negatively impact the usability and the accessibility of the protected application. Motivated by the observation that many automated attacks rely on interaction with the publicly visible code transmitted to the browser, PolyRef proposes to make critical elements of the underlying webpage code polymorphic, rendering machine automation impractical to implement. We categorize the threats that rely on automation and the available anti-automation approaches.

Due to the accumulation effect and sequential detection nature of SIC, however, it is difficult to evaluate the interference of a link. As a result, many existing scheduling schemes become less efficient. In this paper, we take a new look on the problem and focus to the time slot selection stage.

For reaching this objective, numerical modeling of flow and deformation of fractured rock is necessary. This can be achieved by developing deterministic fracture models or models that utilize discrete fracture networks. This study focuses on utilizing stochastic fracture networks to simulate flow in fractured rock and to assess the mechanical rock mass response to stress variations caused by injection/production. A finite element numerical model of fracture network with stochastic description on fracture distribution is presented in this study. In this model, the reservoir is simulated using a system of blocks some of which contain fracture zones and fracture-free matrix zones. The fracture distribution is controlled by the stochastic descriptions of fracture density, size, and orientation, which can be obtained from field data. The model is used to simulate an injection operation. Fluid flow, hydraulic potential, and flow rate are calculated, and the stress response is obtained to determine the fracture aperture change for next injection step. Results show that, as expected, the permeability and flow rate increase in response to injection-induced shear slip in the formation.

Then during the operation stage, the stereo camera snaps stereo images and finds the patterns in right and left images separately by means of the SBM. The 3D positions of the object are calculated by using the corresponding points of the stereo images and the projection matrices of the stereo camera.

Under the conditions of Cu, Mn and Ce mass ratio 1: 1: 0.33 and calcination temperature 500 degrees C, the catalyst had the optimal catalytic activity for benzene oxidation, and its light-off temperature and complete combustion temperature were 165 degrees C and 230 degrees C, respectively. It was indicated by characteristics of XRD and SEM that the presence of copper and manganese oxides and Cu1. 5Mn1. 5O4 with spinel crystal improved the catalytic activity of the catalyst, and the doping of Ce promoted the dispersion and regularization of active components. High calcination temperature led to the sintering of the catalyst surface and agglomeration of active components, which decreased the catalytic activity of the catalyst in the catalytic oxidation", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["331"]}

{"title": "Effects of Current Stressing on Shear Properties of Sn-3.8 Ag-0.7 Cu Solder Joints\n", "abstract": " Effects of electromigration on microstructure, shear strength, and fracture behavior of solder joints were investigated by single-ball shear samples of eutectic Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu (SAC) joined by Cu plates at two sides. The electromigration tests were conducted at a current density of about 1.1\u00d7103 A/cm2 and a working temperature of about 83\u00b0C. The results showed that the shear strength and flow stress decreased greatly after current stressing. Such a decrease was associated with no significant loss of the fracture strain at short electromigration but a great reduction in the fracture strain after long-term current stressing. The variation of the fracture strain with the electromigration time was shown to result from the shift of the fracture surface from the center of the solder towards the intermetallic compound (IMC) interface at the cathode.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Its \u03b21 subunit is one of seven \u03b2 subunits that form the \u03b2-ring of the 20S proteasome, which is responsible for degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. We report here that the \u03b21 subunit is up-regulated in oesophageal cancer tissues and some ovarian cancer cell lines. It promotes cell growth and migration, as well as colony formation. \u03b21 binds and degrades p27Kip1directly. Interestingly, the lack of phosphorylation at Ser158 of the \u03b21 subunit promotes degradation of p27Kip1.

However, the specific nature of this interaction and the influence of solution hydrodynamics remain unclear. To this end, we have followed the calcite (104) surface dissolution using in situ fluid cell atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that at pH 4.5 and in 100 mM Asp the surface reactions were controlled by diffusion under static conditions and that trapezoidal etch pits were formed. In contrast, elliptical etch pits were rapidly developed upon flowing due to the increased transfer of Asp to the [010] step edge and the dissolution of Asp-surface complexes away from the step edge. The occurrence of the [010], [461\u0305], and [4\u030511] steps of trapezoidal etch pits was attributed to the stabilization of the (001), (1\u030512), and (01\u03051) faces by\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The effects of the substitution of Fe for Ni on the cycle stabilities as well as the structures of the alloys have been investigated thoroughly. The results indicate that the substitution of Fe for Ni significantly enhances the cycle stability of the alloys. Furthermore, the positive impact of such substitution on the cycle stability has been observed to be more pronounced for the as-quenched alloy as compared to that for the as-cast one.

Due to the scattering of light, the degradation of an image increases exponentially with the depths of the scene points. Previously implemented methods are limited, because an interactive step was required to select the sky brightness and the vanishing point of the image, as well as the information about the atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an automatic method based on physical model and maximum entropy to remove weather effects using only a single image. First, we segment the sky region by optimal estimated normal distribution and select the lowest point of the sky region as the vanishing point. Then, we exploit the physics-based model to remove weather effects from the image.

The interfacial layer is unavoidably formed for the deposited films and the composition of the interfacial layer is most likely Hf-silicate and SiO x. With the increase in the annealing temperature, it is confirmed that the reaction between SiO x and HfO x N y films formed more Hf-silicate interfacial layer. The valence band offset (\u0394E v) shifts upwards gradually with the increase in annealing temperature due to the decrease in N elements.

Various silicidation conditions were used for each device, yielding different Ni concentrations within the electrode. A higher concentration of Ni in the bottom electrode was found to cause a parasitic SET operation during certain RESET operation cycles, being attributed to field-assisted Ni cation migration creating a Ni filament. As such, the RESET is affected unless an appropriate RESET voltage is used. Bottom electrodes with lower concentrations of Ni were able to switch at ultralow currents (RESET current <1 nA) by using a low compliance current (<500 nA).

To analyze the tolerance of non-heading Chinese cabbage to copper (Cu) stress, 10\u03bcM, 100\u03bcM and 1mM copper were used to treat two cultivars of \u2018Wutacai\u2019as well as \u2018Erqing\u2019and then photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, biomass and chlorophyll content were investigated. In our study, 1mM copper significantly inhibited the photosynthesis and plant growth of both two cultivars. While at 100\u03bcM copper, the growth inhibition was just found in \u2018Erqing\u2019, not in \u2018Wutacai\u2019. The inhibition of copper on the photosynthesis was not only by stomatal factors but also by non-stomatal factors. Copper stress caused damage of photosystem resulting in reduction of PSII efficiency while non-photochemical-quenching parameter NPQ increased. Besides, at low concentration with 10\u03bcM, copper promoted the photosynthesis and plant growth. Therefore, the copper tolerance of non-heading Chinese cabbage was dependent on the genotype, and the plant growth inhibition under copper stress was due to the damage of photosystem. Our results will provide a theoretical basis for a further study on non-heading Chinese cabbage tolerance to copper and will be helpful for the production of non-heading Chinese cabbage in heavy metals contaminated areas.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["331"]}
{"title": "A three-dimensional poroelastic model for naturally fractured geothermal reservoir stimulation\n", "abstract": " One of the most important tasks for geothermal reservoir development is engineering a fractured reservoir and predicting its future performance. For this purpose, numerical modeling of fluid flow and deformation of fractured rock is necessary. This work focuses on utilizing a stochastic fracture network to simulate the thermal-hydro-mechanical response of the reservoir during the stimulation process, and to assess the permeability enhancement in the stimulated zone. The reservoir stimulation process is simulated using a system of rock blocks some of which contain stochastically-distributed fractures and fractured zones. The effect of the fractures on permeability is introduced into the model by using the equivalent permeability approach. The rocks matrix is assumed to be poroelastic and the fractures are allowed to deform and to slip. Heat transport within the fractures, and heat conduction between adjacent rock mass and the fluid in the fracture are also considered. A series of simulations are carried out to analyze the rock mechanical response and permeability evolution for a Newberry-type reservoir. Results show the significant role of fracture distribution and its mechanical deformation in EGS design and development. This model provides a tool to predict the performance of natural fracture networks, and to analyze the stimulation response and future production performance.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Existing works focus on characteristics such as the fast changing rate of the IP addresses (eg A record) and the name server addresses (NS records); the single flux/double flux structure etc. In this work, we tracked and analyzed over 200 fast flux domains and we discovered that the features of the fast-flux networks has shifted. More specifically, we discovered that the changing rate of the IP addresses and name server addresses are slower than reported before, in some cases even slower than some benign applications that leverage fast-flux alike techniques. We also discovered that IP addresses and name servers are shared among different families of fast-flux domains indicating that there is a well-established underground economic model for fast-flux domains. Moreover, we also noticed that instead of using single or double flux, current fast-flux domains exhibit \u201cnlevels\u201d of flux behavior, ie, there appears to be \u201cn\u201d levels of name servers in the DNS system for fast-flux domains.

In this paper, an investigation was made on the effects of decreased rainfall (artificially intercepting 30% of rainfall) on the leaf light-saturated photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and water use efficiency of Q. mongolica during its growth season (from June to September). In early growth stage (June) when the rainfall was low, there was no significant difference in light-saturated photosynthetic rate between decreased rainfall and the control, though the decreased rainfall decreased soil moisture content by 26.4%. However, the decreased rainfall increased the water use efficiency of Q. mongolica by 40.3%, due to the decrease of transpiration rate. In July-September when the rainfall was abundant, the decreased rainfall had no significant effects on the light-saturated photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and water use efficiency, because no difference was observed in the soil moisture content between decreased rainfall and the control. Thereby, whether in low rainfall period (June) or in abundant rainfall period (July-September), a 30% decrease of rainfall in Changbai Mountains could less affect the photosynthetic capacity of mature Q. mongolica during its whole growth season. The high photosynthetic rate in August suggested that the relatively high soil moisture content did not limit the water absorption by Q. mongolica.

METHODS: Twenty-two brainstem of infants with brain stem encephalitis were collected as the experimental group and 10 brainstems of fatal congenital heart disease were selected as the control group. The sections with perivascular cuffings were selected to observe EV71-VP1 expression by immunohistochemistry method and ICAM-1 expression was detected for the sections with EV71-VP1 positive expression. The staining image analysis and statistics analysis were performed. The experiment and control groups were compared. RESULTS:(1) EV71-VP1 positive cells in the experimental group were mainly astrocytes in brainstem with nigger-brown particles, and the control group was negative.(2) ICAM-1 positive cells showed nigger-brown. The expression in inflammatory cells (around blood vessels of brain stem and in glial nodules) and gliocytes increased. The results showed statistical difference comparing with control group (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The brainstem encephalitis can be used to diagnose fatal EV71 infection in infants.

Although discrepancies between these two sources are well known, there have been few studies into the degree and origins of inconsistencies.   Principal findings We compared data from structured interviews and medical records on 1,970 Han Chinese women with recurrent DSM-IV major depression (MD). Correlations were high for age at onset of MD (0.93) and number of episodes (0.70), intermediate for family history (+0.62) and duration of longest episode (+0.43) and variable but generally more modest for individual depressive symptoms (mean kappa = 0.32). Four factors were identified for twelve symptoms from medical records and the same four factors emerged from analysis of structured interviews. Factor congruencies were high but the correlation of factors between interviews and records were modest (i.e. +0.2 to +0.4).   Conclusions Structured interviews and medical records are highly concordant for age of onset, and the number and length of episodes, but agree more modestly for individual symptoms and symptom factors. The modesty of these correlations probably arises from multiple factors including i) inconsistency in the definition of the worst episode, ii) inaccuracies in self-report and iii) difficulties in coding medical records where symptoms were recorded solely for clinical purposes.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The cracking mechanism of the transition region between the straight side and the corner was analysed.

It has been shown that severe thinning deformation or cracking takes place first at the transition region because the effective stress increases gradually from the midpoint of the straight side to the transition point under the effect of friction on the straight side. The mechanism of limiting corner radius is that strain increment along the horizontal direction changes from a positive value to zero at a certain point along the straight side, near the transition point, and then no further material is fed into the corner.

Conventional strategies for blocking CD28 activity using monoclonal antibodies, Fab fragments, antagonistic peptide and fusion proteins, have apparent disadvantages such as inherent immunogenicity, unwanted Fc signaling, poor tissue penetration and bioinstability. Recent research has been directed toward the creation of non-natural, sequence-specific biomimetic oligomers with bioinspired structures that capture the amino-acid interface of the targeted proteins. One such family of molecules is the poly-N-substituted glycines or peptoids, which have close structural similarity to peptides but are essentially invulnerable to protease degradation.

METHODS: Twenty-five SARS patients with respiratory dysfunction treated with NIPPV were studied retrospectively in order to evaluate the influences within 24 hours after initiation of ventilatory support on their physiological indices and oxygenation. Patients with SARS were divided into two groups: survivor group (n= 13) and non-survivor group (n= 12). We compared the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHEII) score, respiratory rate (RR), saturation of oxygen (SpO (2)) and modificative respiratory index (MRI) for the survivors and non-survivors before NIPPV and after NIPPV for twenty-four hours, respectively. RESULTS: Although NIPPV administered via full-face masks might be an effective treatment for rapidly improving vital signs and gas exchange and sense of dyspnea in both groups during the initial 24 hours of ventilatory support, the patients in non-survivor group had higher APACHEII score, respiratory rates and lower SpO (2), MRI than the patients in survivor group (P< 0.05) at the same intervals after initiation of support. CONCLUSION: Noninvasive ventilation should be used as a substitutive tool for endotracheal intubation an alternative treatment for acute respiratory failure related to SARS.

Motivated by this premise we consider the problem of adapting the users' rates to fading variations. Channel-dependent rate adjustments are accomplished after each transition of the fading channel from one state to another. Such rate adjustments (increments or decrements) are constrained to meet some notion of fairness among the users and are designed to ensure that all users remain decodable. Here, we employ the notions of symmetric fair and max-min fair rate adaptations and offer algorithms for computing such fair rate adaptations. Besides fairness, the two other major features of these algorithms are that they are amenable to distributed implementation with limited information exchange among the users, and their complexities scale polynomially in the number of users.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["331"]}

NIH mice were randomly divided into sham-operated group (sham), cerebral ischemia group (ischemia), Sal B-treated group (Sal B) and nimodipine-collated group (Nim). At 6 min after cerebral ischemia, EC, content of PCr and activity of Na+-K-ATPase began to decrease, while level of Lac, brain index and water content of brain increased gradually. However, Sal B (22.5 mg x kg (-1) improved pathophysiological changes at different ischemic times. Especially at 30 min after cerebral ischemia in Sal B group, EC (P< 0.01), content of PCr (P< 0.01 and activity of Na+-K+-ATPase (< 0.05) increased significantly.

METHODS: After hypoxia 0 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, apoptotic cell percentage was determined with Hoechst 33342 straining. Expressions of Caspases-3 mRNA and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in primary culture of cardiomyocytes were determined by using RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. RESULTS: Elevation of Cyt c in cytosol was in accordance with the decline in mitochondrial Cyt c content. Significant increase in Cyt c in cytosol appeared at 12 h post hypoxia and peaked at 24 h while Cyt c in mitochondria could not be detected at 24 h post hypoxia. Hypoxia up-regulated Caspases-3 mRNA expressions beginning at 3 h post hypoxia. Intracellular calcium overload occurred earlier than release of mitochondrial Cyt c and the activation of Caspase-3 during the hypoxic insult. Inhibition of Caspase-3 activation and pretreatment with calcium chelator BAPTA/AM offered a marked protective effect on hypoxia induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia can induce mitochondrion-dependent Caspase-3 activation in cardiomyocytes and therefore leads to cell apoptosis. Increase of intracellular Ca2+ plays an important role in the activation of Caspase-3 and the induction of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["331"]}

{"title": "On the rate adaptation for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks\n", "abstract": " Rate adaptation (RA) is a mechanism to choose transmission rate based on the dynamic channel quality in wireless networks. This paper studied the adaptation algorithm run solely at the sender-side in IEEE 802.11 networks. The key insight is the inference discrepancy in inferring the relative order of transmission rates with respect to the expected performance, which indicates that one cannot always reach the correct order based solely on the channel state information collected by the sender itself. The consequence is wrong rate decision and significant performance loss. Therefore, we present a new RA structure to mitigate such effect by using a novel component, rate testing. Further, by employing the active measurement, a lightweight and effective testing mechanism, SFB, short frame burst, is proposed to detect and filter out the unsuitable transmission rate.

This operation plays an important role and is widely used in MWNs. Interference-aware gossiping scheduling (IAGS) aims to provide an interference-free scheduling for gossiping with the minimum latency. Previous work on IAGS mostly assumes that nodes are always active, and thus is not suitable for duty-cycled scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the IAGS problem in uncoordinated duty-cycled multi-hop wireless networks (IAGS-UDC problem) under protocol interference model and unbounded-size message model. We prove that the IAGS-UDC problem is NP-hard. We propose a novel approximation algorithm called MILD for this problem.

Comparisons are made between the Newtonian fluids and couple stress fluids for the effects on the oil film pressure, the minimum oil film thickness and the leak flow.

Meanwhile, according to the history behavior of grid resource nodes, a simple and efficient node\u2019s credibility dynamic evaluation model is built by using the weighted function. Based on these, a new constrained multiobjective grid task scheduling mode is proposed. In order to solve this model, the relationship between the characteristic of the task and the different performance among nodes is used to define the individual relationship matrix; then the subjection degree function is used to transform each relationship matrix into a fuzzy matrix. According to the different effects of each objective in the final objective, each weight in the final decision-making is determined. In doing so, the multi-objective model is transformed into a singleobjective model. Through the design of a new mode crossover operator and an uniform mutation operator, a genetic algorithm called MUGA for the transformed problem is proposed and the convergence of proposed algorithm is proved.

The rSjLys protein displayed inhibitive effect on the growth of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, rSjLys had a strong inhibitive activity on Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, both the most common pathogenic bacteria in the marine animals.

Current HRV systems typically analyze pre-recorded high resolution ECG recordings. We have demonstrated an analog signal processing circuit which extracts real-time HRV data from EGC signals producing a simple output voltage that is more easily monitored or recorded. The system is accurate and can be produced as a compact low-cost device that can make HRV monitoring more practical for home based health care and implantable devices", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["331"]}
{"title": "Experimental Design and Strategic Gaming Analysis of Oligopolistic Electricity Markets [J]\n", "abstract": " The method of experimental economics is applied to the research of oligopolistic electricity markets. The induced value principle, experimental scheme and procedure with an oligopolistic model of electricity markets are introduced. A set of experiments is conducted on the experimental oligopolistic markets with three GENCOs and the experimental results are analyzed with mathematical statistics approaches. The experimental results show that the market competition will converge to the results between perfect competition equilibrium and Nash equilibrium in oligopolistic electricity markets with asymmetric producer cost functions and repeated play among the producers. The decision support tools of GENCOs have significant influences on experimental results. The markets converge to static Cournot-Nash equilibrium when the bounded-rational subjects repeatedly play, equipped with such tools. The experimental results also show that the differences among selected subjects have no significant influences on the results and thus the experiments are replicable.[Fund]: \u56fd\u5bb6\u91cd\u70b9\u57fa\u7840\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u8ba1\u5212 (973 \u8ba1\u5212) \u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (2004CB217905);; \u56fd\u5bb6\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (04CJL012);; \u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (50207007)", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["331"]}

A microwave-light reactor equipped with a high frequency microwave source and UV light source was used to investigate the effect of microwave on the photocatalytic degradation and product distribution of acetaldehyde over both samples obtained above. The results showed that the sample prepared by the microwave heating presented higher photocatalytic activity and stronger oxidative ability to acetaldehyde than that obtained by conventional heating. There were different oxidative pathways on the two catalysts: the initially reactive intermediates were formaldehyde and formic acid on the sample by microwave heating, and acetic acid on the sample by conventional heating. It was also found that microwave had different effect on the photocatalytic conversion of acetaldehyde for two samples. The effect was more remarkable for the sample prepared by the microwave heating than that prepared by the conventional heating. Enhanced photocatalytic capacity of TiO2 by microwave mainly was from a field effect, which can accelerate a transform of the initial intermediates but does not change the photocatalytic pathway (the pathway depends on the properties of catalyst).", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The results showed that ethylene was not detectable at stages 1 and 2, appeared at stage 3 and increased at stage 5. Transcript of ACC synthase gene did not accumulate at stages 1 and 2, but did so at stages 3-5, and increased gradually at stage 5.

The FTIR results indicate that ethylamine is adsorbed molecularly on the freshly reduced surface, but in the form of an ethylammonium species on the fresh surface exposed to H2S. The TPD results indicate that ethylamine is held strongly, and decomposes to release ammonia at 500 K and ethylene at 883 K. The ethylammonium species is more reactive and releases ammonia at 634 K and ethylene at 622 K. Molecular orbital calculations for the adsorbed ethylamine give good agreement between experimentally observed vibrational frequencies and calculated values.

However, at the site of rs3802228 in 3'UTR of the case group, the left atrial diameter in AF patients with GG genotype was significantly higher than others. After adjusted for covariates age, smoking, Body mass index and hypertension, we did not observe the association of rs4545, rs3802228 with AF. CONCLUSION: Our result suggested that polymorphisms of rs4545 in CYP11B2 gene might not be associated with atrial fibrillation but polymorphism of 3'UTR rs3802228 locus in CYP11B2 gene might be associated with atrial structural remodeling.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["331"]}

To solve the broadcast storm problem, some efficient flooding schemes have been proposed. However, there also exist many problems in these schemes, such as signal collision.

Through theoretical analysis, our algorithm doesn't affect the local optimality gained by EF1.

It was shown that the optimal dosage was 8g/L, and the pollutants in the domestic wastewater was not favorable for the phosphate removal. Phosphate adsorption capacity (PAC) of synthesized zeolites was higher than those of their raw fly ash, and PAC of synthesized zeolite could be enhanced further by Ca2+ saturation. The results also indicated that removal efficiency for phosphate was associated with the calcium content of synthesized zeolite: high calcium content resulted in high removal efficiency.

The florets emasculated by clipping spikelet and lukewarm water still set seeds at certain rates. The completely sterile florets, after being emasculated and checked under microscope one by one, still set seeds, and the highest setting rate is 41.80%. Cytoembryological research indicates that the egg of SAR-1, without fertilization, divides independently into an embryo, which follows the normal process to maturity. Adventitious embryos originate from ovary wall cells. Therefore, it is deduced that SAR-1 has multiple mechanisms of apomixis, and the unfertilized polar nuclei fuse and develop into endosperm cells. The endosperm provids the embryo with nutrient for development. The automatic formation of the endosperm is an obvious feature of SAR-1.

The envelope structure of influenza virus can effectively protect RNA segments from RNase digestion, which provides an advantage for its routine use as an internal control. Utilizing this approach, we successfully generated a recombinant influenza virus (rPR8-HCV) containing the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome.

We transplanted allogeneic rat BMSCs (rBMSCs) into the testicular seminiferous tubules of the model rats and, 30 days after transplantation, observed the composition and structure of the seminiferous tubular cells by HE staining and detected the expressions of CD44, CD106, and c-kit in the rBMSCs by immunohistochemistry. The number of epididymal sperm was significantly reduced in the model rats as compared with the normal controls (P< 0.01). CD44 and CD106, but not c-kit, were expressed in the isolated rBMSCs. At 30 days after transplantation of rBMSCs, lots of new cells were observed in the seminiferous tubules, some expressing CD106 and some expressing the germ cell surface marker c-kit.

But there were great differences in the extent of inhibition after 0, 7, 28 and 84 days of aging in the artificial soils. The most obvious effect occurred in 1000 mg x kg (-1) and 1500 mg x kg (-1) experimental groups. There was a very big difference in the effects of Pb (NO3) 2 on reproduction of E. fetida with different aging times.

Meanwhile, the purpose of this article is to try to allocate the emission permits on water function districts based on the existing administrative features in China and the water function planning field. According to this allocation mode, the emission rights should be allocated to the respective water body by the pollution control agency according to the function of water body (vertical configuration), and then the rights be allocated in detail to the dischargers (horizontal configuration). In this model, the fairness and efficiency were regarded as the objective functions. The concentration and total quantity of pollutant were the constraints, and the continuity of the production program of the dischargers was taken into account. At last, we got an example and solved it by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to verify that the model is viable, and this distribution could get more environmental capacity.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The results showed that the plasma levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23 significantly increased in patients with aGVHD or cGVHD, compared with the patients without clinical signs of GVHD and the healthy donors (p< 0.05), while IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 (1) were obviously lower than that of them (p< 0.05). After aGVHD and cGVHD patients were treated effectively, the plasma levels of IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23 were significantly decreased, and IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 (1) were significantly increased, while the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 did not markedly change. The TGF-\u03b2 (1) level were negatively correlated with IL-6 (r=-0.36, p< 0.05), IL-17 (r=-0.51, p< 0.05) and IL-23 (r=-0.44, p< 0.05) respectively, while there were positive correlations between IL-6 and IL-17 (r= 0.62, p< 0.05), IL-6 and IL-23 (r= 0.71, p< 0.05), IL-17 and IL-23 (r= 0.93, p< 0.05).

The concentrations of SOC in bulk soil increased 70% from 2.89 g/kg soil in remnant Suaeda salsa-vegetated soil to 4.90 g/kg in 14-year Spartina alterniflora soil, and these values enhanced significantly along its chronosequence. The increase mainly resulted from a high quantity of organic residues incorporated in the soil. Compared with Suaeda salsa-vegetated soil, The SOC concentration increased significantly in coarse fraction (> 250 \u00b5m and 53-250 \u00b5m) of Spartina alterniflora-vegetated soil, while there was no obvious difference in fine fraction (2-53 \u00b5m).

METHODS: From September 2007 to June 2008, a total of 1200 swine bile specimens were collected from three slaughter houses located in Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangsu, the Eastern China, and detected for HEV RNA by using nested RT-PCR. The positive PCR products were sequenced. Then the swine HEV were phylogenetically determined with human HEV isolated in Eastern China. RESULTS: The positive rate for HEV RNA in swine herds was 4.5% totally. Significant differences of HEV detection were not observed among seasonal pattern (Sep-Oct: 6%, Dec-Jan: 4.33%, Mar-Apr: 4.33%, May-Jun: 3.33%) but in geographic distribution (Jiangsu: 6%, Anhui: 5%, Zhejiang: 2.5%). Regardless of isolation from different areas, swine and human genotype-IV HEV shared a high similarity. Phylogenetically, there were 80%-100% and 96%-100% identities within swine genotype-lV HEV at the nucleotide and amino acid levels respectively. Between swine HEV and human HEV, there were also similarities of 76%-99% and 95%-100%. It was noted that some human and swine isolates were clustered with bootstrap values of> 90%.

Incorporation of La in HfO 2  can raise the film crystallization temperature from 400degC to 900degC. Moreover, NMOSFETs fabricated with HfLaO gate dielectric exhibit superior electrical performances in terms of threshold voltage (V th ), bias temperature instability (BTI), channel electron mobility and gate leakage current compared to those fabricated with HfO 2  dielectric. Particularly, the authors also report that the effective work function (EWF) of metal gate (MG) can be tuned to a wide enough range to fulfil the requirement of bulk CMOSFETs by employing HfLaO dielectric and n- and p-type metal gates respectively. These advantages are correlated to the enhanced thermal stability and reduction of oxygen vacancy density in HfLaO compared to HfO 2 , making it a promising high-k gate dielectric to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["331"]}

In addition to the wealth-based optimisation objective, the effect of the economic environment is also incorporated into this model.

Analytical developments were carried out in a backcross situation in order to specify the bias and to propose an algorithm to control it. The outbred population context was studied through simulated data sets in a wide range of situations. The likelihood ratio test was firstly analyzed under the \"one QTL\" hypothesis in a backcross population. Designs of sib families were then simulated and analyzed using the QTL Map software. On the basis of the theoretical results in backcross, parameters such as the population size, the density of the genetic map, the QTL effect and the true location of the QTL, were taken into account under the \"no QTL\" and the \"one QTL\" hypotheses. A combination of two non parametric tests - the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test - was used in order to identify the parameters that affected the bias and to specify how much they influenced the estimation of QTL location.

Several methods, including elevated dissolved oxygen, increased superficial velocity, elevated calcium concentration, extended starvation time, have been employed to reveal when and how filamentous sludge could be denser in terms of settleability. It showed that increased superficial velocity improved the settleability and event triggered filamentous granulation in a short term, ie, sludge volumetric index (SVI) decreased from 800 mL/g to 350 mL/g, and it became less effective in a long term, as the SVI increased to approximately 800 mL/g after a short period of stable operation. Elevated calcium concentration also improved the settleability by clustering the mycelium of filamentous microorganisms, and then SVI decreased to 300 mL/g gradually, but no granulation was observed. However, negligible changes were observed by elevated dissolved oxygen or extended starvation time, as the decrease of SVI value could not be significantly observed. Additionally, relationship between ovality of filamentous mesh and sludge volumetric index was also examined.

In this thesis, Ca2Gd8(SiO4)6O2:Dy3+ films were prepared by the sol\u2013gel method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and lifetimes were used to characterize the resulting films. AFM study indicated that the phosphor films consisted of 120 nm homogeneous particles. By combining the model of Burshtein for donor\u2013donor migration and the V-F-B model for donor\u2013acceptor energy transfer, the experimental luminescence decay curve of 6P J state of Gd3+ was re-simulated. It is found that concentration quenching of Gd3+ can be due to the result of the joint action of donor\u2013donor (Gd3+\u2013Gd3+) energy migration and donor\u2013acceptor (Gd3+\u2013Dy3+) energy transfer.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["331"]}
{"title": "Reflective optical bi-stability of antiferromagnetic films\n", "abstract": " We investigate one magnetically nonlinear response of antiferromagnetic (AF) films to incident electromagnetic waves, or the reflective optical bi-stability (ROB). Such geometry is used, where the AF anisotropy axis and external static magnetic field both are parallel to the film surfaces and normal to the incident plane. For TE incident waves with the electric component transverse to the incident plane, the ROB of the AF film with the absorption is calculated, but the case of TM incident waves is neglected since no magnetic nonlinearity is induced in this geometry. The bi-stability is completely different in the two resonant-frequency vicinities. Two kinds of bi-stability are found in the higher vicinity, and their features versus incident power are opposite. We also find that there are critical incident angle and critical film thickness for the existence of bi-stability.

The result shows that the seasonal mean aerosol optical depth 5 (AOD) at 500 nm in MAM is 0.4. The single scattering albedo (SSA) at 500 nm in MAM at SACOL fluctuates significantly ranging from 0.82 to 0.97. The averaged value of SSA there for background aerosol is 0.92 in MAM, while it is smaller (0.89) during the dust event outbreak period. The smaller SSA can be interpreted as the result of larger particles during dust events. The averaged asymmetry factor (ASY) at 500 nm during 10 dust event period is 0.81, which is much larger than 0.68 of background aerosols. The averaged shortwave radiative effect of the aerosols during dust event period in MAM is\u2212 6.25,\u2212 86.33 and 80.08 wm\u2212 2, respectively, at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), surface and in the atmosphere.

An increase of the intensity for the blue band around 440 nm followed by a red photoluminescence centered at 750 nm after storing the suspension for two months. The steady-state PL spectra excited by different wavelength and time-resolved PL spectra of the samples demonstrate that the blue PL band with a delaytime of nanosecond order is caused by the band-to-band recombination in Si nanocrystals. The oxidation of the silicon nanoparticle causes the decaytime increasing. The red PL band originates from radiation recombination of carries via defect/surface-related states and the delay-time of which is on the order of microsecond.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["331"]}

{"title": "Molecular basics of tripartite symbiosis formed by rhizobia, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and legumes\n", "abstract": " Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and rhizobia are two of the most important plant symbionts in natural habitats. Many leguminous plants have the ability to associate with the two microbial symbionts, which yield arbuscular mycorrhizae and root nodules. Moreover, AM fungi, rhizobia and leguminous plants are able to form a tripartite symbiosis. It has demonstrated that the intimate association is determined by the mutual recognition and subsequently the penetration of plant tissues in the establishment stage. Additionally, symbiotic interactions are involved in molecular communication between the host plant and its hemicrobial symbiont in the rhizosphere. It has been shown that the establishment of arbuscular mycorrhizae and root nodules share some common features in early signaling. On the basis of this, four parts of the molecular basics of the tripartite symbiosis were discussed: the signals which host-plant roots excrete for AM fungi and rhizobia recognization, the mechanism of host-plant root responses to AM fungi and rhizobia colonization, the relevant genes transcription and expression, and the forming procedures of the symbionts.

Chinese spring. The result showed that, membrane permeability, contents of Na+ and proline, Na+/K+, PEPCase activity increased as NaCl concentration was increased, while contents of water and K (+) decreased; under the same saline condition Na+ contents in shoots and roots of shortsubulate barley were less than those of wheat, and K+ content in roots of shortsubulate barley was more than that of wheat. These indicated that shortsubulate barley tended to take up less Na+ and maintain higher K+ in shoots. The increment of proline in shortsubulate barley was less than that in wheat, which showed that osmotic homeostasis in shortsubulate barley was not realized by excess increment of proline under salt stress; and the fact that the activity of PEPCase in shortsubulate barley was higher than that in wheat indicated that the improvement of photosynthetic efficiency is possibly one of the main ways for shortsubulate barley to adapt to salt stress.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The results show that winds, pressure, temperatures and humidity all have abrupt changes when the black storm passes through meteorological stations, changes associated with the black storm are much stronger than that with dust storms. The dust wall is almost isothermal, with horizontal thickness of about 4-9? km. Strong surface winds were mainly caused by rapid intensification of the cold front and the cold advection. Meanwhile, the development of a upper level jet and strong downward transport of momentum by the sinking branch of the upper level jet's secondary circulation are also important for the formation of strong surface winds. The mixed layer is the crucial stratification factor affecting the formation of black storm because it can minimize the energy required to develop the deep dry convection and so is favorable for the formation of black storm in drought region. In this case primary reason that the black storm occurres at the northern foothills of Tianshan Mountain is the formation of deep mixed layer, which is induced by the surface heating for a long time. So the deep dry convection can be developed when the cold front passes and the black storm occurres there.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["331"]}

METHODS: 0.01, 0.1, 1 mmol/L H2O2 treated K562 cells at 10, 30, 60 and 180 min to established the models of DNA damage. Furthermore, K562 cells were induced apoptosis by 0.1 mmol/L H2O2 at different time (6-48 h) and different concentration (0.5-1,000 micromol/L) of H2O2 at 48 h. DNA damage and cell apoptosis were detected by DNA gel electrophoresis. And the immunoblotting assay was used for detecting expressions of JWA protein and correlated genes (hsp27, hsp70 and p53). RESULTS: During the DNA damage, JWA was much more sensitive to H2O2 than those heat shock proteins, and its expression pattern was very similar to that of hsp70. And at low concentration of H2O2-exposure (0.01 mmol/L), the expressions of JWA and heat shock proteins were all increased greatly. In addition, JWA, hsp70, hsp27 and p53 overexpressed and their expression pattern were similar during cell apoptosis.

{"title": "Two-Phase Pattern Search-based Learning Method for Multi-layer Neural Network\n", "abstract": " A new multi-layer artificial neural network learning algorithm based on pattern search method is proposed. The learning model has two phases-a pattern search phase, and a local minimum\u2014escaping phase. In the pattern search phase, our method performs local search iteratively and minimize the error measure function along with the set of descent directions of the error measure directly and finds the nearest minima efficiently. When the network gets stuck in local minima, the local minimum-escaping phase attempts to fill up the valley by modifying temperature parameters in ascent direction of the error measure. Thus, the two phases are repeated until the network gets out of local minima. The learning model is designed to provide a very simple and effective means of searching the minima of objective function directly without any knowledge of its derivatives. We test this algorithm on benchmark problems, such as exclusive-or (XOR), parity, Arabic numerals recognition, function approximation problems and a real world classification task. For all problems, the systems are shown be trained efficiently by our method.

The present results also showed that the stimulatory effect of AFP on the growth of SMMC-7721 cells was decreased by the anti-serum of AFP. The anti-AFP antibody alone could suppress the growth of SMMC-7721 cells. On the other hand, AFP and anti-AFP antibody had no effect on the growth of HL-60 human leukemia cells, indicating that the tumor cell growth stimulating effect of AFP was not simply due to non-specific addition of exogenous protein and this effect of AFP showed strict tumor cell specificity.

During sports movements a player loads the surface, resulting in deformation that can change the surface behaviour, which in turn modifies the player biomechanical response. Improving the understanding of surface response to actual player loading is important for developing enhanced products for improving play performance. Likewise, by improving knowledge of surface effects on players, the understanding of injury risk can be improved. However, there is currently no published research to measure and analyse the behaviour of artificial turf system during real player locomotion.

Growth parameters, pigments content, gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence and antioxidant system were measured after one growing season (AOT40 value of 38.24 \u03bcL\u00b7 L-1\u00b7 h). At the end of experiment, both current and old needles showed visible symptoms, and the seedlings were harvested for growth parameters measurement. Elevated O3 did not significantly change height growth, diameter increment, total biomass and biomass partition. E-O3 had negative effects on the photosynthetic parameters, eg significant decreases in net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and pigments content. However, chlorophyll a/b ratio, intercellular CO2 concentration, water use efficiency, and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were not affected significantly by E-O3 in comparison with CF.

{"title": "An elastoplastic model for sand considering disturbance\n", "abstract": " The relative density Dr, which has a dramatic change before and after loading during construction, is a major factor for the strength-deformation property of sands. However, the effect of Dr was not taken into consideration in most elastoplastic models. To solve this problem, a new elastoplastic model, the SMP-Lade model, was established by considering the Lade-Duncan model and SMP criterion. Then, based on triaxial consolidated-drained tests data on ISO standard sands of China, the sensibility of the model parameter to Dr was analyzed. Furthermore, based on the disturbed state concept (DSC), the general disturbance function (D) was established. The disturbance parameter could be deduced from the relative density of sands. At last, the elastoplastic model considering disturbance, which could reflect the contribution of disturbance to the strength-deformation property of sands, was proposed through establishing the relationship between parameters K and peak strength (\u03baf-ft) and disturbed degree. Supposing that the material parameters \u03c7 and \u03c8 and the parameters of the SMP-Lade model at initial state were given, the stress-strain-volume change relations of sands at randomly disturbed state could be predicted by the proposed model. The test results show that the proposed model can well describe the strength-strain-volume change relations of sands at a given disturbed state.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Cross combination was designed by selecting two sweet corn inbred (T14 and T4) with significantly different EHC. Genetic segregation analysis for EHC was evaluated using major gene-polygene mixed inheritance inheritance Subject Category: Miscellaneoussee more details models and joint analysis of P 1, P 2, F 1, B 1, B 2 and F 2 populations. A genetic mapping population of 330 F 2 individuals was used to establish QTL for EHC with the screening method of composite interval mapping (CIM). EHC of T14 was controlled by a major additive gene and some additive-dominant polygenes, and inheritance of the major gene was dominant. Four QTLs were identified in F 2 population and six in F 2: 3. Moreover, three QTLs were detected in both F 2 and F 2: 3. The genetic model of one major gene is consistent with QTL mapping result that QTL with high contribution rate for EHC was clustered simultaneously on chromosome 1. The genetic mode and major QTL for EHC from this study may improve the efficiency of high yield and lodging resistance breeding and molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) under high density cultivation condition.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["331"]}

METHODS: We established a reliable and stable diagnostic method of TaqMan-MGB real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect hMPV in the clinically manifested respiratory samples. To understand the role of hMPV in children's ALRTI, we tested other seven common respiratory viruses, using direct immunofluorescence assays (DFA). RESULTS: Data was analysed on the rates of detection among patients with respiratory bacteria, mycoplasma pneumonia and chlamydia among the targeted samples and enrolled patients to display the spectrum of respiratory pathogens and the changing pattern of pathogens with time. Of 622 samples, hMPV was detected to be positive in 24 (3.86%) samples. However, the prevalence of hMPV in the winter season of 2006 to 2007 was higher than that in the winter season of 2007 to 2008. The majority of children infected with hMPV were younger than 5 years old. Data from phylogenetic tree analysis further demonstrated A2 genotype hMPV circulating during the study period. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were important respiratory pathogens among children with ALRTI and respiratory syncytial virus.

{"title": "Multitarget tracking and classification in collaborative sensor networks via sequential Monte Carlo methods\n", "abstract": " The convergence of recent developments in rnicroelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microprocessors, and ad hoc networking protocols have enabled low-power and low-cost sensor nodes to collaborate and achieve large tasks [1]. Individually, each node owns limited sensing, communicating and computing capabilities, but, when a large number of them are used in conjunction, it is possible to achieve a reliable and robust network. These devices collect measurements from the physical environment, communicate with each other, and carry out computations in order to transmit only the required data to the end user. The network is then able to perform event detection, event identi\ufb01cation, and location sensing in a \ufb01eld under observation [2]. Typical applications of such sensor networks are environmental monitoring, military surveillance, and space exploration, to name a few. This chapter focuses on the problem of jointly tracking and classifying several targets evolving within densely scattered sensor nodes. On the one hand, multiple target tracking tackles the issue of sequentially estimating the state of a possible varying number of objects; and on the other hand, classi\ufb01cation deals with the identi\ufb01cation of those objects down to a given class. Due to the fact that the number of targets can vary, we are handling three closely coupled subjects: target detection, tracking, and classi\ufb01cation. Considering the strong interrelations existing between those, it is natural to address them jointly.As the amount of observation data is limited, making use of motion models for the targets is essential to obtain a good tracking performance.

Both viruses expressed red fluorescence protein gene (dsRed) as a reporter in mammalian cell lines. AcRed-tat also contained the coding sequence of HIV-1 Tat transduction peptide fused with viral major capsid protein gene vp39 and enhanced green fluorescence gene (egfp) driven by virus polyhedrin promoter. It expressed the Tat fusion protein in infected insect cells, which was incorporated into the nucleocapsids of progeny virus. As a control, AcRed had the fusion gene of vp39 and egfp driven by polyhedrin promoter. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that although similar level of red fluorescence was produced in HEK23 cells transduced by the two recombinant viruses, significantly higher red fluorescence level was seen in CHO and Vero cells transduced by AcRed-tat than that by AcRed. These results suggested that Tat transduction peptide might improve the baculovirus-mediated gene expression in some mammalian cells.

However, their overall resolution is limited by the circuit nonideality such as component matching and finite operational amplifier (opamp) gain, especially in scaled CMOS technologies. On the other hand, process scaling renders robust and power-and-area efficient digital-processing elements. Digital calibration thus becomes an attractive way to improve pipelined ADC linearity, allowing the design specifications of expensive analog components to be relaxed at the cost of increased complexity in the digital domain.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Transvaginal ovum pick-up with a needle using an ultrasonic endovaginal transducer was started in late 1987. In 1988-1989 the transvaginal method was employed more frequently than laparotomy, and it has become a routine practice in the IVF program. The ultrasonic endovaginal approach seemed to give a low ovum recovery rate (70.99%), but the fertilization rate was high (85.10%, P less than 0.05), and the rate of embryo transfer was 89.33%. The average number of pre-embryo per transfer was 2.26. These figures were quite similar in the two groups.

METHODS: The ALF model was established by administering intraperitoneal (ip) injections of D-Ga1N (700 mg/kg) and LPS (10 mug/kg) to six C57BL/6 mice. Three of the modeled mice were also administered 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA; 100 mg/kg ip) at 6 hours before the onset of ALF and served as the intervention group. Non-modeled mice served as controls. All mice were analyzed by western blotting and qRT-PCR to determine the expression levels of ERS-related proteins in liver tissue. Liver function was assessed by measuring levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum. Extent of injury to the liver tissue was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and histological analysis. qRT-PCR was also used to detect differences in expression of inflammation-related genes, and western blotting was also used to detect differences in expression of the apoptosis related protein Caspase-3. The extent of apoptosis in liver tissue was assessed by TUNEL assay. RESULTS: The ERS markers GRP78 and GRP94 showed increased expression at both the gene and protein levels which followed progression of ALF. The ERS effector proteins XBP-1, ATF-6 and IRE 1 a involved in the unfolded protein response were activated in the early stages of ALF, and the ERS-induced apoptosis regulators Caspase-12 and CHOP were activated in the late stage of ALF.

{"title": "Light amplification by stimulated emission from an optically pumped molecular junction in a scanning tunneling microscope\n", "abstract": " Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate optical amplification and stimulated emission from a single optically pumped molecular tunneling junction of a scanning tunneling microscope. The gap between a sharp gold tip and a flat gold substrate covered with a self-assembled monolayer of 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole molecules forms an extremely small optical gain medium. When electrons tunnel from the molecules highest occupied molecular orbital to the tip, holes are left behind. These can be repopulated by hot electrons induced by the laser-driven plasmon oscillation on the metal surfaces enclosing the cavity. Solving the laser-rate equations for this system shows that the repopulation process can be efficiently stimulated by the gap modes near field, TERS scattering from neighboring molecules acting as an optical seed. Our results demonstrate how optical enhancement inside the plasmonic cavity can be further increased by a stronger localization via tunneling through molecules. We anticipate that stimulated emission from an STM junction will advance our fundamental understanding of quantum plasmonics and lead to new analytical applications. Furthermore, this concept represents the basis for novel ultra-small, fast, optically and electronically switchable devices and could find applications in high-speed signal processing and optical telecommunications.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The cultured human cell line DU145 was knocked down for ILK using a siRNA. Cellular ILK expression was quantified by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Moreover, cell attachment, invasiveness and microfilament dynamics assays were performed. Furthermore, the impact of the ILK siRNA on the prostate cancer was tested using a nude mice model in which prostate cancer was induced by orthotopic injection of human prostate cancer cell line DU145. Gross tumor volume of prostate in nude mice, cell differentiation, the state of apoptosis and proliferation were tested after 5 weeks of injection. The expression of ILK was suppressed significantly by siRNA, cellular mRNA and protein of ILK decreased 87% and 81% separately. The knockdown of ILK also induced the attachment and invasiveness of DU145 cell growing down. The tumor volume, cell differentiation, apoptosis index and proliferation index of prostate in nude mice of ILK siRNA orthotopic injection model were significantly smaller, better, increased and decreased separately than those in control group. Targeting inhibition of ILK not only decreases attachment and invasiveness of human DU145 cells, but also suppresses the growth and development of prostate cancer of orthotopic injection human DU145 cell line model in nude mice.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) scans started as soon as intravenous injection of 11C-PD153035 (15-20 MBq/0.3 ml) was completed, images were collected continuously. The region of interest (ROI) was used to study the percentage of radioactivity in major organs and implanted tumors in the rats. The accumulation and blocking study in vitro was completed. RESULTS: There were significant differences in 11C-PD153035 uptake among major organs. The maximum uptake in the organs ranked in the following order: liver> gastrointestinal tract> kidney> lung> brain> muscle. Radioactivity could be also observed in the tumors. The radioactivity ratio (T/NT, target/non-target) peaked (4.15) at 40-50 min post injection. The in vitro blocking study showed that 11C-PD153035 uptaken by C6 cells could be blocked by PD153035.

And thus the characteristic fluorescence of Tb (III) ion is enhanced and the maximum fluorescence peak locates at 545 nm. The second-order scattering (SOS) peak at 545 nm also appears for the Tb (III)-NFLX complex with the excitation wavelength of 272 rnm. When the silver nanoparticles were added to the Tb (III)-NFLX binary system, the luminescence intensity at 545 nm greatly increased. And the relative intensity is proportional to the amount of NFLX. Based on this phenomenon, a novel method for the determination of NFLX has been developed by using a common spectrofluorometer to measure the intensity of fluorescence and SOS. The calibration graphs for NFLX are linear in the range of 6.0 x 10 (-9)-1.0 x 10 (-5) mol x L (-1), and the detection limit is 4.4 x 10 (-9) x mol x L (-1). This method was applied satisfactorily to the determination of NFLX in capsule and eye drop samples.

To solve this problem, we have proposed an error function which can harmonize the update weights connected to the hidden layer and those connected to the output layer by adding one term to the conventional error function. It can avoid the local minima problem caused by this disharmony. We applied this method to the Boolean Series Prediction Questions problems to demonstrate its validity.

{"title": "A comparison of local field potentials and spiking activity to predict perceptual report during bistable visual stimulation\n", "abstract": " Certain continuously moving objects appear to spontaneously reverse their motion direction (eg, the illusion of structure-from-motion, SFM). The neuronal mechanisms underlying these perceptual fluctuations still remain elusive. Spiking activity from individual neurons in cortical middle temporal visual area (MT) has been shown to correlate to a certain degree with an animal\u2019s perceptual report during stimulation with SFM and related paradigms of bistable perception. Similarly, certain frequency bands of the local field potentials (LFPs) can be used to predict these perceptual judgments (Maier et al., SFN 2005). Here we ask whether spiking activity or local field potentials are better correlated with the perceptual outcome of bistable stimulation. Two macaque monkeys were trained to report the perceived direction of motion in an SFM task while single-unit activity (SUA), multiunit activity (MUA) and LFPs were recorded from area MT. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, we compared the ability of each neural signal to predict the monkeys\u2019 perceptual report on individual trials (choice probability, CP). Percept-related LFP changes were assessed by evaluating the power spectrum of the LFP as well as the spike-field coherence before and around the time of perceptual report. We found that both LFP power and spike-field coherence in the gamma band showed choice probabilities significantly greater than expected by chance. Lower frequency bands revealed smaller or insignificant values, thus revealing reduced coupling with the outcome of perceptual analysis. Choice probability of all sub-band of the LFP was lower than that of the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The present study was to investigate the effect of hnRNP E2 decoy RNA on the cell proliferation in K562 leukemia cells, and further elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Decoy hnRNP E2 plasmid was constructed and transfected into K562 cells using cationic liposome. Stably transfected cells were selected with G418. The cell proliferation rate was determined by cell growth curve using trypan blue staining, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The changes of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) and c-Myc gene expression were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. RESULTS: The proliferation rate of stably transfected K562 cells was inhibited by (62.73+/-12.92)%. The cell cycle was arrested at S phase [stably transfected K562 cell group:(55.59+/-4.67)%, control group:(44.70+/-4.21)%, P< 0.05]; C/EBPalpha mRNA level remained unchanged. However the 42 ku-C/EBPalpha protein expression was elevated by (49.72+/-5.58)%; c-Myc mRNA and protein expression was inhibited by (58.27+/-7.23)% and (57.26+/-6.52)%, respectively. CONCLUSION: HnRNP E2 decoy RNA could inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells, and this may be caused by the blockage of the binding between hnRNP E2 and C/EBPalpha mRNA and subsequent elevation of 42 ku-C/EBPalpha by decoy RNA.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The dry mass of shoots and roots had no significant difference in the range of 350 mmoland# 8226; L-1 NaCl stress, and NaCl stress inhibited the growth of shoot more severely than that of root. The increment of Na+ content in root was more than that in shoot, K+ contents in shoot and root were all decreased, but shoot could maintained higher K+ level, the higher K+/Na+ resulted from the higher K+-Na+ selectivity of plasma membrane. X-ray microanalysis indicated Na+ in cytoplasm was compartmented into vacuole and apoplast under salt stress with lower concentration. Na+ efflux out of shoot was the main path way of ion homeostasis under salt stress with higher concentration.

To solve this problem, we propose a modified error function with added terms. By adding one term to the conventional error function, the modified error function can harmonize the update of weights connected to the hidden layer and the output layer. Thus, it can avoid the local minima problem caused by such disharmony. Moreover, some new learning parameters introduced for the added term are easy to select.

Muller cells are thought 10 have an important role in regulating retinal microvascular function and growth. Our goal is to identify the factors produced and released by Muller cells to mediate their function on target cells. Method. Muller cells isolated from rat retina were maintained in a serum-free medium for 3 days and the resulting conditioned medium (MCM) was clarified by centrifugation and filtration. The growth rate of the bovine retinal microvascular endothelial (BRE), bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) and mink lung epithelial CCL-64 cells were evaluated in the presence of various concentrations of MCM. Results. Addition of MCM to exponentially growing cells stimulated the proliferation of retinal microvascular endothelial cells but not that of the mink lung epithelial cells. When target cells were incubated with low concentrations of VEGF, BRE cells responded to mitogenic action of this specific factor. The BAE cells were less sensitive to either VCM or VEGF. Muller cell stimulation of BRE cells via MCM was partially inhibited by the addition of and VEGF polyclonal antibody to the culture and by adsorption of MCM to heparin-conjugated sepharose column.

First it is combined with partitioning technique, so that it can be applied to solving a problem of large size, even solving it in a microcomputer. Second it is combined with substructuring technique, so that it can be applied to the case that more than one plasticity zones occur in a structure. The practical computation demonstrate that PNSMM or extended PNSMM is a more efficient means than the available techniques for the elastic-plastic analysis of structure. In addition, it is significant to note that if PNSMM is applied to the optimum design or the contact problem of structure, a high computational efficiency can also be expected.(orig./GL)", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["331"]}

METHODS: Clinical data of 44 patients with NUAT-NKTCL diagnosed at Peking University Cancer Hospital between 1999 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients, there were 31 males and 13 females with a median age of 39 years (range, 15 to 82 years). 27 patients (61.4%) were stage III/IV, 28 (63.6%) with B symptoms, 12 (27.3%) ECOG\u2265 2, 18 (40.9%) IPI score\u2265 3, and 48.8% patients had elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase. The common primary sites were skin (21/44, 47.2%) and intestinal tract (11/44, 25.0%). All the 44 patients received systemic chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 13.5 months (range, 0.3-121.0 months), 32 patients died, and the median overall survival (OS) was 16 months with 1-year OS rate as 54.1%. CR rate of the 26 patients received CHOP or CHOPE regimens as the first line chemotherapy was 19.2%(5/26). Then L-asparaginase (L-ASP)-based regimens were used for salvage treatment, with CR rate of 47.7% and the median OS of 13 months. CR rate of the other 18 patients received L-ASP-based regimens in the firstline therapy was 55.6%(10/18) with the median OS of 16 months. Using L-ASP in firstline treatment obviously improved CR rate (P= 0.015), but did not affect OS (P= 0.774). CONCLUSION: Although L-ASP improved the efficacy of NUAT-NKTCL, but the prognosis remained dismal.

The results show that the average concentrations of Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn, Hg and As are 27.8 mg/kg, 21.8 mg/kg, 0.137 mg/kg, 83.2 mg/kg, 0.051 mg/kg and 10.8 mg/kg respectively. The single factor indices and the assessment on potential ecological risk degree have respectively indicated that in the survey area the heavy metal pollution status belongs mainly to a moderate pollution degree and the ecological risk of heavy metals is slight as a whole, with the ecological risk of Cu, Pb, Zn and As being slighter. Cd shows mainly slight ecological risk, but at some monitoring stations its ecological risk reaches to a moderate degree. Hg shows a moderate ecological risk mainly. The potential risk of heavy metals to the regional environment is in the order of HgCdAsCuPbZn, with Hg being the chief risk factor and followed by Cd.[Fund]: \u6d59\u6c5f\u7701\u73af\u4fdd\u79d1\u6280\u8ba1\u5212\u4e13\u9879\u57fa\u91d1\u9879\u76ee\u2014\u2014\u6d59\u6c5f\u8fd1\u5cb8\u6d77\u57df\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u4e2d\u57fa\u8d28\u7ed3\u5408\u6001\u78f7\u5316\u6c22\u6c14\u8d28\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u53ca\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u7814\u7a76 (2009-33); \u6d59\u6c5f\u7701\u73af\u4fdd\u79d1\u6280\u8ba1\u5212\u4e13\u9879\u57fa\u91d1\u9879\u76ee\u2014\u2014\u9ebb\u75f9\u6027\u8d1d\u6bd2\u548c\u8179\u6cfb\u6027\u8d1d\u6bd2\u6db2\u8d28\u8054\u7528\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6d59\u6c5f\u6cbf\u6d77\u8d1d\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5f81\u7814\u7a76 (2008-29)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

This study was designed to clarify if angiotensin II (Ang II) was involved in the adaptational change of the L-type calcium channel (Ca (L)) in the cerebral arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) under simulated weightlessness. Tail suspension (SUS) for 3 d was used to simulate immediate early cardiovascular changes to weightlessness. Then VSMCs in cerebral basilar artery were enzymatically isolated using papain, and Ca (L) current (barium instead of calcium as current carrier) in VSMCs was measured by whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. The results showed that 3-day simulated weightlessness significantly increased current density of Ca (L). However, IV relationships of normalized peak current densities and steady-state activation curves of Ca (L) were not affected by simulated weightlessness. Although Ang II significantly increased current densities of Ca (L) in both SUS and control rats, the increase of Ca (L) current density in SUS rats was much more than that in control rats. These results suggest that 3-day simulated weightlessness induces the adaptational change of Ca (L) in cerebral VSMCs including increased response to Ang II, indicating that Ang II may play an important role in the adaptational change of cerebral arteries under microgravity.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

A prominent example of such systems is the DFT-Spread-OFDM uplink in the 3GPP LTE based cellular network. We adopt the diversity multiplexing tradeoff framework and show that, in the presence of an ideal outer code, precoding does not improve the diversity order obtained using the optimal decoder. On the other hand, in the presence of an ideal outer code precoding can be detrimental from a diversity order perspective when linear receivers are used. In the latter case, we show that a simple way to guarantee improved diversity orders is to optimize the symbol loading. Finally, we extend our analysis to the multiuser case and propose an algorithm to optimally divide the available subcarriers among the multiple active users.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The 6-month survival rate was 86.9% and 87.8% in patients with grafts of GRWR more than 0.8% and in patients with graft of GRWR less than 0.8%, respectvely (x2= 0.022, P more than 0.05), however, middle hepatic vein reconstruction significantly affected the survival rate of small-size-liver recipients (x2= 10.612, P less than 0.01). Donor age and gender-mismatch were not associated with the survival rate of recipients (P more than 0.05). Steatosis is an important risk factor in living donor liver transplantation. Lower GRWR is not a limitation but we must reconsider its importance in liver transplantation. The donor age and gender-mismatch are not associated with the survival rate of recipients.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

{"title": "Application of improved fractal algorithm in small target detection [J]\n", "abstract": " An improved fast method based on fractal theory is presented for small and weak target detection in a single-frame image. The algorithm firstly uses the local entropy information to locate the target coarsely, and then a region of interest (ROI) containing the small target is obtained. Secondly, a fractal dimension image of this region is constructed based on the fractal theory. Finally, self-adaptive threshold segmentation is used for the fractal dimension image to get the exact detection result. Compared with the traditional fractal algorithm, the presented method is divided into two parts: coarse location and accurate location. The region to be processed by the fractal algorithm is reduced to a small range that is estimated by local entropy, thus overcoming the defect of huge computational cost and poor anti-noise capability of traditional fractal methods. The experimental results prove that the proposed method is robust, fast and effective for small and weak target detection.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The results were analyzed with independent samples t-test (Mann-Whitney) using SPSS 10.0. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in differentiation at the 9th day or 28th day among the preadipocytes obtained from the abdomen, hip or extremity with the negative-pressure method. The preadipocytes from the abdomen differentiated more at the 28th day than the 9th day (P< 0.05), which was not observed in the hip or the extremity. The preadipocytes obtained from the abdomen with the negative-pressure method differentiated more than those with the syringe method (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: No essential difference was found in preadipocyte differentiation among the liposuction sites, while the abdomen might have some superiority. The negative-pressure method of liposuction is the first option in future research of tissue engineering. The flow cytometric analysis is a convenient way to study\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Investigations were carried out by evaluation of EBSD/SEM and Kikuchi patterns/TEM. At high temperatures and low strains bulging of prior grain boundaries could frequently be observed. Nucleation due to instabilities of the substructure only very locally occurred. A high twin frequency indicated that twinning is an active nucleation mechanism that promotes the expansion of the recrystallization front. At medium high temperatures DRX started in the region of grain boundaries due to an orientation gradient in a highly inhomogeneous microstructure.(orig.)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

The lattice constants and the unit cell volume of R3Fe29-xTxHy decrease with increasing R atomic number from Nd to Dy, except for Ce, reflecting the lanthanide contraction. Regular anisotropic expansions mainly along the a-and b-axis rather than along the c-axis are observed for all of the compounds upon hydrogenation. Hydrogenation leads to an increase in the Curie temperature and a corresponding increase in the saturation magnetization at room temperature for each compound.

The data suggest that not only the release of CGRP from the peripheral organs, but also the transcription of CGRP mRNA and synthesis of CGRP in sensory neurons are increased during the development of endotoxicosis in the rat. Presumably the DRG is an important source of CGRP release in the response to endotoxicosis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

{"title": "Numerical integration of a linear barotropic model using three methods of treating meteorological and gravitational modes separately\n", "abstract": " The analytical solution of a linear barotropic model is derived, including details of the quasi-geostrophic initialization procedure. The prognostic equations are integrated using three different methods of treating the meteorological and gravitational modes separately. These are a semi-Eulerian, semi-implicit (EI) technique, a semi-Lagrangian, semi-implicit (LI) procedure, and a split-explicit (SE) method. The stability criteria and phase speeds are derived for each of the three techniques.               The following theoretical conclusions are derived. Of course, in actual numerical integrations particularly those using more complex models, the results are not so unequivocal.               The stability of the EI procedure is governed by the CFL criterion for the meteorological mode. Gravity waves have no effect on the timestep but move more slowly than the analytical waves.

{"title": "[The extracellular matrix and liver disease: a study with enzymoimmunological assay].\n", "abstract": " Serum concentrations of laminin and hyaluronate were assayed in 138 patients of liver disease with an enzymoimmunological method. There was a mild increase of hyaluronate level in patients with acute hepatitis (P< 0.05) and a significant increase of both serum laminin and hyaluronate concentrations in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, as compared with those in healthy controls (P< 0.001). Serum laminin and hyaluronate reached the highest levels in patients with liver cirrhosis. Comparing the results from a group of patients with liver cirrhosis with those from a reference group of patients with chronic active hepatitis, we obtained values for specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic efficiency of 0.90, 0.90 and 0.90 respectively. The results suggested that quantification of serum laminin and hyaluronate may be a useful test to assess the degree of chronic liver injury and to diagnose liver fibrosis.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Instrum. 42, 876 (1965) has been employed to calculate transmission probability and a three\u2010dimension dynamic model has been suggested which can satisfy any complicated boundary conditions theoretically. Finally, the reasons why the transmission probability of gas molecules through a moving channel tends to a constant value (which is smaller than 1) rather than unity while the drag speed increases infinitely have been explained.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

Results show that in low and medium carbon martensite of Si--Mn--V steels (20SiMn2V, 20SiMn2VRE, 40SiMn2V, and 40SiMn2VRE), both epsilon and theta carbide preciitation may happen during auto-tempering. The rare earth elements in low-carbon martensite can inhibit the precipitation of epsilon carbide, and decrease the precipitated quantity of theta carbide and the extent of auto-tempering. However, in medium-C martensite, the rare earth elements can raise the extent of auto-tempering and does not affect the precipitated type of auto-tempering carbide.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}

{"title": "Equipment Power Consumption and Cost for Enterprise Access Links-Source Data\n", "abstract": " Notes: 1. Most of the power consumption values provided in datasheets are the maximum power budget and thus represent an upper limit and not typical values of power consumption at full load.[15] Therefore, if the typical power consumption of a component is explicitly given in the datasheet, it is used in the paper. Otherwise, the power value used is derived as 90% of the given maximum power consumption.2. Although the power value 204 W includes the power consumed by two ports and OC (R2d) in both the static and dynamic solutions require only one port, the power consumption of each component is still counted as 204 W. Since here we assume that the ports cannot be turned off individually. In contrast, in the provider network, there would be multiple active ports for OP (R2d). Hence, the power values are calculated as 204\u23a1 K", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["331"]}
