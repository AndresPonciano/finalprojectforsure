In addition to the traditional text and voice services, all mobile phone service providers in Kenya have incorporated mobile money as a core business function. Mobile money is viewed as a key driver that will \u2018leap\u2019 frog the economy of Kenya, bringing poor people into financial system who have been for a long time been excluded by financial institutions. Despite the positive advancements in mobile money, transaction cost and facilitating conditions remains a major hindrance to the adoption on mobile money services. This paper investigates impact of transaction cost and facilitating conditions in the adoption of mobile money in Kenya. A survey was conducted to gather data which was coded in SPSS 16. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to analyze the data and Structural Equation Modeling using Analysis of Moment Structures was used to validate the research model. The research model included three main components; transaction cost, facilitating conditions and adoption. The model was developed based on a review of technology adoption models. The analysis revealed that facilitating conditions impact positively to the adoption of mobile money services. Results demonstrate that facilitating conditions do influence adoption usage of mobile money services.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["1231"]}

Introduction of eL in such institutions is often complex involving introduction of new technology, resistance by users and alignment issues. Most eL research in developed countries is on continuity, which is not the case in developing countries. The aim of this chapter is to address this gap by investigating whether Mombasa Polytechnic University College (MPUC) students, who had never had any eL experience, would accept it. The model used in this case is a Modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). In this chapter, we adopt a survey approach supplemented by case studies. The findings are that majority of the students believe that their results will improve with eL and that a blended learning system or 'Click-nMortar institution with many courses online' is the best model for MPUC and similar institutions. The research proposes a framework for eL implementation. The findings are beneficial to institutions of higher learning in developing countries.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1231"]}

It enhances collaboration within and among public sector organizations between Government and the business community, and between government and their citizens. Successful e-government depends on how well the targeted users (citizens) make use of the services. Kenya ranks very lowly on citizen usage of e-government systems, having been ranked by a UN report in 2010 with an e-readiness index value of 0.33. This is below the world average of 0.42, which makes Kenya better than only 60 other countries in the world. To implement and utilize modern and innovative technology, it requires that the government as well as citizens be e-ready, hence the need to evaluate their readiness for e-governance. Several research findings reveal that a high index may be only indicating that a country is e-ready in terms of Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and info-structure, institutions among others which is a very poor measure of the e-readiness of citizens. The aim of this paper is to investigate e-readiness factors in the context of Kenya's e-government systems. A desktop survey was used and findings indicate that e-readiness can be hampered if the users are not considered. This means that for any government to successfully implement any e-government initiative, the citizen should be well prepared to use the systems.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1231"]}
{"title": "Improving student enrollment prediction using ensemble classifiers\n", "abstract": " In the recent years, data mining has been utilized in education settings for extracting and manipulating data, and for establishing patterns in order to produce useful information for decision making. There is a growing need for higher education institutions to be more informed and knowledgeable about their students, and for them to understand some of the reasons behind students\u2019 choice to enroll and pursue careers. One of the ways in which this can be done is for such institutions to obtain information and knowledge about their students by mining, processing and analyzing the data they accumulate about them. In this paper, we propose a general framework for mining student data enrolled in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) using performance weighted ensemble classifiers. We train an ensemble of classification models from enrollment data streams to improve the quality of student data by eliminating noisy instances, and hence improving predictive accuracy. We empirically compare our technique with single model based techniques and show that using ensemble models not only gives better predictive accuracies on student enrollment in STEM, but also provides better rules for understanding the factors that influence student enrollment in STEM disciplines.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1231"]}

{"title": "Size and complexity metrics as indicators of maintainability of business process execution language process models\n", "abstract": " One of the most popular process modeling languages is the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). Despite the popularity, BPEL process models have an inherent complexity. This complexity keeps on increasing with age as a result of maintenance routines. Structural properties of BPEL process models such as size and complexity are claimed to influence maintainability factor of the process models. In the past, researchers have applied measurement to quantify the size and complexity of process models and thereafter utilized the measurement results to modify or to enhance the quality of the models. The problem with BPEL process measurement is that very few valid metrics exist that can beused for BPEL process models. Although several validation studies have been carried out, these were based on other language environments other than BPEL. To generalize the results of these studies to BPEL process models might be inaccurate, especially that BPEL has richer semantics than most other business process modeling languages. In addition, many of the existing validation studies did not focus on the external quality characteristic of maintainability, which makes it difficult to assess the value of the validated metrics as maintainability indicators for BPEL process models. To address this problem, this thesis proposes a suite of size and complexity metrics for measuring the structural properties of BPEL process models and then investigates whether these metrics can be useful indicators of the maintainability of BPEL process models.

Agents from different platforms are likely to use different types of messages or message formats and the interpretation is likely to differ. The main driver for interoperability is partly the customer who strives for universality when accessing multiple services, and partly producers who often need to act in fast to obtain a sustainable customer base. Implementations of agent systems differ greatly in architecture thereby negatively affecting interoperability, system diversity, rapid proliferation of agent technology, and advancement of the industry.  In order to standardize some aspects of agent technology, considerable research has been conducted in the area of interoperability of agent technologies.  Hence, it would be interesting to find out what agent systems interoperability frameworks have been proposed in the last few years.

{"title": "Complexity Metrics for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets\n", "abstract": " Many front-end web developers are nowadays increasingly using sassy cascading stylesheets (SCSS) instead of the regular cascading style sheets (CSS). Despite its increased demand, SCSS has inherent complexity which arises from its features such as the use of nesting, inheritance, variables, operators, and functions. In addition, SCSS complexity, like all other software, continually increases with age. High complexity is undesirable because it leads to software that is difficult to understand, modify and test. Although there has been some metrics proposed to measure stylesheets complexity, these were defined in the context of regular CSS, and cannot be used to measure SCSS due to differences in their syntax. This paper proposes four metrics for measuring the complexity of SCSS code. The metrics have been used to calculate the complexity of three code snippets and three real-world projects and were found to be intuitional. The metrics were also evaluated using the Kaner framework and satisfied all the evaluation questions, indicating that they are sufficiently practical as required in the industry. In addition, the metrics were evaluated using Weyuker\u2019s properties, and results show that all the four metrics satisfied seven out of the nine properties, implying that they are theoretically sound.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1231"]}

To address this problem, this study proposed an effort estimation method for SOA centred on size metrics and effort factors. The proposed method enables estimation of effort factors using fuzzy logic technique to improve on estimation accuracy. The method was automated into a tool to facilitate entry of parameters and display of results. The study employed experiment research design based on 15 SOA projects developed by computer science undergraduate students to validate the proposed estimation method. To complement the experiment, we used a survey study involving 20 programmers from the industry to confirm the relevance of effort estimation factors proposed in this study. Result from the experiment revealed that the proposed method is more accurate and returned a lower Mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE).

Technology reinforces this interaction by producing appropriate responses that then lead to improved communication between humans and computational devices. Although latest developments in mobile phone technologies have opened the way for a new generation of mobile social applications that allow users to interact and share information, there is still very limited user support information on how to use different applications. This problem either increases the learning curve of the users, thereby adversely affects their overall efficiency. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze factors that affect the learnability of mobile social software. A sample of 361 respondents was selected, with 345 respondents returning feedback. Primary data was collected through the use of questionnaires and interviews targeting mobile social users in Nakuru County Kenya. Three social networks were used, namely, WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. Data analysis was done using descriptive statistics. Findings indicate that interface features affect learnability across the three social networks, with learnability of WhatsApp turning out to be higher than that of compared to Facebook and Twitter.

{"title": "Accelerating Research in Africa through Sustainable Virtual Research Communities\n", "abstract": " Despite the commendable efforts by African NRENs to interconnect universities and research institutions, research capacity in Africa is still a major challenge. In particular African universities and research institutions phases the challenges of training, retaining and attracting competent researchers due to limited resources. Other limitations include cultural barriers, insecurity, government bureaucracy and technological resource limitations among others. However the introduction of modern communications techniques resulting from innovative information and communication technological transformations will go a long way to address these challenges. It is expected that improved connectivity will influence a paradigm shift in research approach in Africa. In order to remain relevant in the current competitive knowledge economy, African researchers ought to take advantage of the improved connectivity to reengineer their research approach by embracing current information and communication technology innovations. This study investigates how modern collaborative tools can be exploited to ensure effective brain circulation within Africa and attract young talents into research careers so as to boost Africa\u2019s research capacity. In the context of the expected paradigm shift from traditional research methods to e-research, the study examines the role of virtual research communities in addressing Africa\u2019s research challenges and hence accelerating research in Africa. The study takes into account the expected transformations of the scientific communication and points out the virtual communities\u2019 role in the current social context.
