While focus groups have been popular in studies of other disciplines where a researcher investigates \u2018why\u2019,\u2018what\u2019and \u2018how\u2019aspects of a phenomenon of interest in practical context, the potential of this research method is under-exploited in RE. One reason could be that computer science, software engineering and Information Systems (IS) programs in most universities do relatively little to prepare their master students and PhD researchers on the use of this research method. As a result, the method is partly understood and is sub-optimally or incorrectly applied, or avoided altogether. This may translate in a missed opportunity for RE researchers to engage with practitioners in industry-relevant research that could be both done in costeffective and pragmatic way.This mini-tutorial provides some practical suggestions on how to evaluate the fitness of focus group research techniques to a research context, how to design a good enough focus-group-research process, how to counter validity threats and how to report and publish the results.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["414"]}

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) such as security, safety, performance, and reliability are treated in a rather ad hoc fashion and are rarely traced. This is mainly because of the unique nature of NFRs. They are subjective, relative and they tend to become scattered among multiple modules when they are mapped from the requirements domain to the solution space. Furthermore, NFRs can often interact, in the sense that attempts to achieve one NFR can help or hinder the achievement of other NFRs at particular software functionality. Such an interaction creates an extensive network of interdependencies and tradeoffs among NFRs which is not easy to trace. In a previous work, we proposed a conceptualization of NFRs through the NFRs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["414"]}

Yet, quantitatively approaching NFR early in a project is hard. This paper makes a step towards reducing the impact of uncertainty due to NRF. It offers a solution that incorporates NFRs into the functional size quantification process. The merits of our solution are twofold: first, it lets us quantitatively assess the NFR modeling process early in the project, and second, it lets us generate test cases for NFR verification purposes. We chose the NFR framework as a vehicle to integrate NFRs into the requirements modeling process and to apply quantitative assessment procedures. Our solution proposal also rests on the functional size measurement method, COSMICFFP, adopted in 2003 as the ISO/IEC 19761 standard. We extend its use for NFR testing purposes, which is an essential step for improving NFR development and testing effort estimates, and consequently for managing the scope of NFRs.

Currently, measuring the benefits from ERP reuse is attracting increasing attention, yet most organizations have very little familiarity with approaches to evaluating quantitatively requirements reuse customers have achieved. This paper is intended to provide a solid understanding of ERP requirements reuse measurement. It describes the first results obtained from the integration of explicit and systematic reuse measurement with standard requirements engineering (RE) practices in ERP implementation projects. Aspects of measurement planning, execution and reuse data usage are analyzed in the context of SAP R/3 implementation.

Advanced collaboration technologies support companies in synchronizing their joint actions by forming digital business ecosystems (DBE). While such technologies are beneficial to companies, their use might also be potentially detrimental due to the increased complexity they add to the management of the BDE partners' collaboration and due to the partners' lack of knowledge in coping with this complexity. For companies to deal with the complexities in their dynamic environments, they need approaches for mapping out and analyzing their DBEs. Due to the newness of the DBE concept, how to model and analyze DBEs is hardly known. Yet, this is necessary, as partners in a DBEs want to know if their DBEs promotes or prohibits profit.

{"title": "Tool support for change impact analysis in requirement models: exploiting semantics of requirement relations as traceabilitt relations\n", "abstract": " In the process of software engineering, eliciting requirements yields the first software artifacts; software requirements specifications. Software requirements are used to describe what a software system should do and are used to validate if the implementation satisfies the needs determined for it. From the moment that the first artifacts are produced, they are subject to change. Software artifacts are related to each other through traceability information. Using the traceability information, change impact analysis is performed and it is determined which related software artifacts require changes as well. However, without additional semantics of traceability information an explosion of impacts occurs. This means that change impact analysis yields all related artifacts and causes many false positives. Existing literature states that additional semantics should be employed to counter the explosion of impacts. Recent research yielded a metamodeling approach for requirements models that describes semantics for requirements relations. Tool support has been developed following this approach, that allows for inferencing and consistency checking of requirements models using these relations. However, the tool provides no support for performing change impact analysis. In this work, the semantics of requirements relations are exploited for the use of change impact analysis. This is done by identifying a classification of change for the formalized requirements model. Consequently different rationales of change are identified. It is determined that domain changes drive the change impact analysis. By combining the formalization for the rationale of change and the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["414"]}

As a consequence, stakeholders at early project stages acquire as much as possible knowledge about the requirements, their risk estimates and their prioritization. Current industrial practice suggests that in most software projects this scope assessment is performed on the user\u2019s functional requirements (FRs), while the non-functional requirements (NFRs) remain, by and large, ignored. However, the increasing software complexity and competition in the software industry has highlighted the need to consider NFRs as an integral part of software modeling and development. This paper contributes towards harmonizing the need to build the functional behavior of a system with the need to model the associated NFRs while maintaining a scope management for NFRs. The paper presents a systematic and precisely defined model towards an early integration of NFRs within the requirements engineering (RE).

{"title": "Function point counts derived from SAP business scenario requirements\n", "abstract": " Recent years have witnessed a very high level of interest in the SAP technology and the Function Points Analysis (FPA). The motivation for implementing the SAP R/3 business application suite is twofold. On one side, SAP provides the information technology infrastructure for business process re-engineering [2] and a component-based concept for R/3 implementation which benefits the most from software reusability. On the other side, SAP has protected its customers from the Year 2000 problem and, in addition, has brought interne capabilities to the R/3 application suite. Simultaneously, Function Points (FP) have been becoming widely accepted as the standard metric for software controlling and planning.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["414"]}
{"title": "ARIS-based framework for enhancing reference models: experience in simultaneous bid preparation\n", "abstract": " The paper presents a strategy for enterprise modelling within Business Process Re-engineering. Adopting the ARIS methodology, the strategy is based on the idea that the business process models developed by means of a given technique within a certain BPR-project could be reused in other BPR-initiatives. The feasibility of the approach is proven within two case studies taken from the ESPRIT Project No. 7131 \u201cBIDPREP \u2014 An Integrated System for Simultaneous Bid Preparation\u201d.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["414"]}
{"title": "What Industry Wants from Requirements Engineers in China? An Exploratory and Comparative Study on RE Job Ads\n", "abstract": " [Background] Publications on the professional occupation of Requirements Engineering (RE) reported on market demands for both RE and non-RE qualifications and indicated the state-of-the-practice of RE roles in industry. However, prior research was not from the perspective of the RE area in the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Nor, they shed light on the industry needs of RE professionals in China.[Aims] This paper focused on RE-specific tasks and skills sought after in China, from the perspective of RE activities elaborated in SWEBOK.[Method] Using an empirical qualitative research method, we selected and analyzed 535 job ads from China's two largest job portals. Job titles and descriptions of these ads were analyzed to uncover RErelevant responsibilities in the categories of RE activities in SWEBOK as well as RE skills.[Results] We identified the qualifications, experience and skills\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["414"]}
{"title": "Developers' Eyes on the Changes of Apps: An Exploratory Study on App Changelogs\n", "abstract": " Release planning for mobile apps has only recently become an area of active research. As a result, little is known about the types of requirements that app developers pay the most attention to when releasing an app. This research uses the changelogs of apps to shed light on this. We report the results of an exploratory study in which we analyzed the requirements that dominate the changes of apps, according to a set of 3000 changelogs collected from 120 apps from three categories in the Apple App Store: Travel, Social networking, and Books. We analyzed the changelogs in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, from a developers' perspective. Our results suggest that developers' releases are by far more concerned with non-functional requirements than with functional requirements. We also found that usability and maintainability are the most frequently mentioned non-functional requirements\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["414"]}
{"title": "Experiences in Using Practitioner\u201f s Checklists to Evaluate the Relevance of Experiments Reported in Requirements Engineering\n", "abstract": " Background: Requirements Engineering (RE) researchers recognize that for RE methods to be adopted in industry, practitioners should be able to evaluate the relevance of a study to their practice.. Kitchenham et al proposed a set of perspective-based checklists, which demonstrated to be a useful instrument for this purpose. Specifically, the checklist from the practitioner\u201f s perspective seems to be a good candidate for evaluating the relevance of RE studies to RE practice. However, little is known about the applicability of the checklist to the area of RE. Moreover, this checklist also requires a greater analysis about its reliability. Aim: The aim of this report is to propose a perspective-based checklist to the RE community that allows evaluating the relevance of experimental studies in RE from the practitioner\u201f s/consultant\u201f s viewpoint. Method: Our research followed an iterative design-science based approach in which we first analyzed the problems with a previously published checklist and developed an operationalized proposal for a new checklist to counter these problems. We performed a reliability evaluation of this new checklist. The research was performed with two practitioners and 24 papers that report experimental results on comprehensibility of software requirements specifications. Results: This report gives first-hand experiences of practitioners in evaluating the relevance of primary studies in RE, by using a perspective-based checklist. With respect to the reliability of the adjusted checklist, 9 of out 19 questions show an acceptable proportion of agreement (between two practitioners).Conclusions: Based on our experience, the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["414"]}
