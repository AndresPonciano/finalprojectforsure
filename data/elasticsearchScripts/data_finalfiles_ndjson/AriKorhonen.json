{"title": "The Effect of Achievement Badges on Students' Behavior: An Empirical Study in a University-Level Computer Science Course.\n", "abstract": " Achievement badges are a form of gamification that are used in an attempt to increase user engagement and motivation in various systems. A badge is typically a graphical icon that appears as a reward for the user after reaching an achievement but that has no practical value. In this study, we describe and evaluate the use of achievement badges in the TRAKLA2 online learning environment where students solve interactive, automatically assessed exercises in a Data Structures and Algorithms course throughout the semester. We conducted an experiment where the students (N= 281) were randomly divided into a treatment and a control group, with and without achievement badges. Students in the treatment group were awarded achievement badges, for example, for solving exercises correctly on the first attempt, doing exercises early, or solving all the exercises in a round with full points. Grading was the same for both groups, ie collecting badges did not affect the final grade, even though the exercise points themselves did. Students\u2019 activity in TRAKLA2 was logged in order to find out whether the achievement badges had an effect on their behavior. We also collected numerical and open-ended feedback in order to find out students\u2019 attitudes towards the badges. Our results show that achievement badges can be used to affect students\u2019 behavior. Statistically significant differences were observed in the time used per exercise, number of sessions, total time, and normalized total number of badges. Furthermore, the majority of the students reported being motivated by the badges.

{"title": "Visual algorithm simulation\n", "abstract": " Understanding data structures and algorithms, both of which are abstract concepts, is an integral part of software engineering and elementary computer science education. However, people usually have difficulty in understanding abstract concepts and processes such as procedural encoding of algorithms and data structures. One way to improve their understanding is to provide visualizations to make the abstract concepts more concrete.  This thesis presents the design, implementation and evaluation for the Matrix application framework that occupies a unique niche between the following two domains. In the first domain, called algorithm animation, abstractions of the behavior of fundamental computer program operations are visualized. In the second domain, called algorithm simulation, the framework for exploring and understanding algorithms and data structures is exhibited.  First, an overview and theoretical basis for the application framework is presented. Second, the different roles are defined and examined for realizing the idea of algorithm simulation. The roles considered includes users (i.e., learners and instructors), visualizers (those who specify the visualizations), programmers (those who wrote the original algorithms to be visualized), and the developers (those who continue to design and implement the Matrix framework). Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm simulation exercises, the main application embodied in the framework, is studied. The current tool is utilized for delivering, representing, solving, and submitting tracing exercises that can be automatically assessed, and thus provides meaningful feedback on learners performance.", "num_citations": "67\n", "authors": ["925"]}

The first group did the exercises on the web and the second one in the classroom sessions. A web based system was employed that was able to give feedback and automatically assess the exercises. The research question was to find out how we should introduce the self study material and automatically assessed exercises to the students in order to maximize their learning experience and to avoid drop outs. In addition, we surveyed the students\u2019 attitude towards www-based exercises by using questionaries. The students were asked what kind of exercises they would prefer to do in DSA courses as well as how they would assess their own learning experience in the three different setups (human guided, web based or mixed). All these studies were carried out simultaneously in two different universities. It is not surprising that the results suggest to introduce easy and human guided exercises at the very beginning of the course. However, we conclude that currently there is an emerging need for both webbased and classroom exercises. The recommended way to introduce the web-based exercises in DSA courses is by combining these two approaches. There is a set of exercises that are best suitable to be solved and automatically assessed on the web while the rest of the exercises are best suitable for traditional classroom sessions.

Ty\u00f6ss\u00e4 hy\u00f6dynnet\u00e4\u00e4n WWW:n hypermediaominaisuuksia ja toteutetaan Java-ohjelmointikielell\u00e4 graafinen ja vuorovaikutteinen k\u00e4ytt\u00f6liittym\u00e4 tietorakenteiden ja algoritmien opetuksen tukena toimivalle TRAKLA-j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4lle.  Oppimisymp\u00e4rist\u00f6n kehitysty\u00f6 perustuu TRAKLA-j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4n toimintojen siirt\u00e4miseen WWW-ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6\u00f6n sek\u00e4 uuden visuaalisen ja vuorovaikutteisen k\u00e4ytt\u00f6liittym\u00e4n kehitt\u00e4miseen.  Koko j\u00e4rjestelm\u00e4st\u00e4 k\u00e4ytet\u00e4\u00e4n nimityst\u00e4 WWW-TRAKLA.  Kyseess\u00e4 on palvelin/asiakas-arkkitehtuuri, jossa perinteisill\u00e4 ohjelmointikielill\u00e4 toteutettuun palvelimeen (TRAKLA) liityt\u00e4\u00e4n Java-ohjelmointikielell\u00e4 toteutetulla asiakasp\u00e4\u00e4n itsen\u00e4isell\u00e4 sovelluksella.   Tavoitteena on saavuttaa joustava ja laiteriippumaton oppimisymp\u00e4rist\u00f6.  Java-yhteensopivien WWW-selainohjelmien my\u00f6t\u00e4 t\u00e4m\u00e4n tyyppisten j\u00e4rjestelmien toteuttaminen on mahdollista laiteriippumattomasti.  Tehokkaana kehitysty\u00f6kaluna Java tarjoaa monipuoliset ty\u00f6kalut toimivien ja helppok\u00e4ytt\u00f6isten sovellusten kehitt\u00e4miseen.
