{"title": "Comparative analysis of encapsulated Java collection framework based on storage attributes\n", "abstract": " Carrying forward the trend of reuse in java, we had developed a framework by encapsulation of classes based on class properties. The framework can be seen to have the potential to overpower the Collection Framework which developed by Joshua Bloch. Collection framework triumphs over other data storage technologies in today's environment. However Collection Framework has a complex and unwieldy hierarchy which is recognized before and our framework mainly looks into this issue. It can greatly reduce the efforts required to learn and use the complex hierarchy of Collection Framework. In this paper we have analyzed the proposed framework and have compared it with already existing Collection Framework on various aspects.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2147"]}
