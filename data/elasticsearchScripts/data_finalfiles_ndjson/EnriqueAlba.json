{"title": "Parallelism and evolutionary algorithms\n", "abstract": " This paper contains a modern vision of the parallelization techniques used for evolutionary algorithms (EAs). The work is motivated by two fundamental facts: 1) the different families of EAs have naturally converged in the last decade while parallel EAs (PEAs) are still lack of unified studies; and 2) there is a large number of improvements in these algorithms and in their parallelization that raise the need for a comprehensive survey. We stress the differences between the EA model and its parallel implementation throughout the paper. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of PEAs. Also, successful applications are mentioned and open problems are identified. We propose potential solutions to these problems and classify the different ways in which recent results in theory and practice are helping to solve them. Finally, we provide a highly structured background relating to PEAs in order to make researchers aware\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1066\n", "authors": ["538"]}

{"title": "Parallel evolutionary algorithms can achieve super-linear performance\n", "abstract": " One of the main reasons for using parallel evolutionary algorithms (PEAs) is to obtain efficient algorithms with an execution time much lower than that of their sequential counterparts in order, e.g., to tackle more complex problems. This naturally leads to measuring the speedup of the PEA. PEAs have sometimes been reported to provide super-linear performances for different problems, parameterizations, and machines. Super-linear speedup means that using \u201cm\u201d processors leads to an algorithm that runs more than \u201cm\u201d times faster than the sequential version. However, reporting super-linear speedup is controversial, especially for the \u201ctraditional\u201d research community, since some non-orthodox practices could be thought of being the cause for this result.

An external archive is used to store the non-dominated solutions found during the evolution process. With this basic model in mind, there are many different design issues that can be faced. Among them, we focus here on the synchronous/asynchronous feature of the cGA, the feedback of the search experience contained in the archive into the algorithm, and two different replacement strategies.

{"title": "Influence of the migration policy in parallel distributed GAs with structured and panmictic populations\n", "abstract": " Parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs) have been traditionally used to overcome the intense use of CPU and memory that serial GAs show in complex problems. Non-parallel GAs can be classified into two classes: panmictic and structured-population algorithms. The difference lies in whether any individual in the population can mate with any other one or not. In this work, they are both considered as two reproductive loop types executed in the islands of a parallel distributed GA. Our aim is to extend the existing studies from more conventional sequential islands to other kinds of evolution. A key issue in such a coarse grain PGA is the migration policy, since it governs the exchange of individuals among the islands. This paper investigates the influence of migration frequency and migrant selection in a ring of islands running either steady-state, generational, or cellular GAs.

The days in which researchers struggled to slightly tighten worst-case bounds that were anyway far from practical or in which \ufb01nding a PTAS (let alone a FPTAS) for a certain problem was considered a whole success are thus swiftly coming to an end.

A recent replacement-based diversity management strategy is successfully applied to alleviate the premature convergence drawback.

{"title": "Metaheuristics and parallelism\n", "abstract": " In practice, optimization problems are often NP-hard, complex, and CPU timeconsuming. Two major approaches are traditionally used to tackle these problems: exact methods and metaheuristics. Exact methods allow to \ufb01nd exact solutions but they are impractical as they are extremely time-consuming. Conversely, metaheuristics provide suboptimal solutions in a reasonable time. They allow to meet the resolution delays often imposed in the industrial \ufb01eld. Metaheuristics fall in two categories: local search metaheuristics (LSMs) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs). A local search starts with a single initial solution. At each step of the search the current solution is replaced by another (often the best) solution found in its neighborhood. Very often, LSMs allow to \ufb01nd a local optimal solution and so are called exploitation-oriented methods. On the other hand, EAs make use of a randomly generated population of solutions. The initial population is enhanced through a natural evolution process. At each generation of the process, the whole population or a part of the population is replaced by newly generated individuals (often the best ones). EAs are often called exploration-oriented methods. Although the use of metaheuristics allows to signi\ufb01cantly reduce the temporal complexity of the search process, the latter remains time-consuming for industrial problems. Therefore, parallelism is necessary to not only reduce the resolution time but also to improve the quality of the provided solutions.

This search model relies on a set of eight subpopulations residing in a cube topology having two faces for promoting exploration and exploitation. The resulting technique has been shown to yield very accurate results in continuous optimization by using crossover operators tuned to explore and exploit the solutions inside each subpopulation. We introduce here a further extension of Hy3, called Hy4, that uses 16 islands arranged in a hypercube of four dimensions. Thus, two new faces with different exploration/exploitation search capabilities are added to the search performed by Hy3. We analyze the importance of running a synchronous versus an asynchronous version of the models considered. The results indicate that the proposed Hy4 model overcomes the Hy3 performance because of its improved balance between exploration and exploitation that enhances the search.

Real data instances of the AFP are very difficult to solve owing to the NP-hard nature of the problem, so combining grid computing and metaheuristics turns out to be a way to provide satisfactory solutions in a reasonable amount of time. GrEA has been deployed on a grid with up to 300 processors to solve an AFP instance of 2612 transceivers. The results not only show that significant running time reductions are achieved, but that the search capability of GrEA clearly outperforms that of the equivalent non-grid algorithm.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["538"]}

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are especially well-suited for solving such kind of problems because they are able to find multiple trade-off solutions in a single run. However, these algorithms may be computationally expensive because (1) real-world problem optimization typically involves tasks demanding high computational resources and (2) they are aimed at finding the whole front of optimal solutions instead of searching for a single optimum.

When a WSN is being deployed, there are two major concerns: the coverage achieved has to be the largest possible, and the lifetime of the network has to be the longest possible. Since the lifetime of a WSN is determined by the power spent by any node in the network, which in turn is dominated by the power spent for transmissions, a way to increase the lifetime is to minimize the transmission power in any node of the network. We propose in this work the use of a memetic simulated annealing (MSA) to solve a newly defined instance for the problem of WSN deployment (a.k.a.

In order to achieve these goals we comparatively evaluate the appropriateness of the well-known panmictic logistic model, hypergraph model and two new models for dEAs.

{"title": "Measuring the performance of parallel metaheuristics\n", "abstract": " Most optimization tasks found in real-world applications impose several constraints that usually do not allow the utilization of exact methods. The complexity of these problems (they are often NP-hard [13]) or the limited resources available to solve them (time, memory) have made the development of metaheuristics a major \ufb01eld in operations research. In these cases, metaheuristics provide optimal or suboptimal feasible solutions in a reasonable time. Although the use of metaheuristics allows to signi\ufb01cantly reduce the time of the search process, the high dimension of many tasks will always pose problems and result in time-consuming scenarios for industrial problems. Therefore, parallelism is an approach not only to reduce the resolution time but also to improve the quality of the provided solutions. The latter holds since parallel algorithms usually run a different search model with respect to sequential ones [4]. Unlike exact methods, where time efficiency is a main measure for success, there are two chief issues in evaluating parallel metaheuristics: how fast can solutions be obtained, and how far they are from the optimum. We can distinguish between two different approaches for analyzing metaheuristics: a theoretical analysis (worse-case analysis, average-case analysis,...) or an experimental analysis. Several authors [16, 20] have developed theoretical analyses of some importance for a number of heuristics and problems. But, their difficulty, which makes it hard to obtain results for most realistic problems and algorithms, severely limits their range of application. As a consequence most of the metaheuristics are evaluated empirically in an ad hoc\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["538"]}

Currently, WiFi (IEEE 802.11 based) technologies are used to deploy such networks. The coverage limitations of WiFi technologies and the high mobility of VANET nodes generate frequent topology changes and network fragmentation. For these reasons, and without any central manager entity, the routing task is a challenging work. Thus, offering an efficient routing strategy is crucial to deploy VANETs in order to offer as high as possible QoS. A way to obtain a suitable routing protocol for VANETs is to find an optimal configuration for an existent one. The huge number of possible configurations practically prevents obtaining an efficient protocol configuration without using automatic intelligent design tools. This motivates the use of metaheuristic techniques as well-suited tools to solve such kind of problems [3]. Unfortunately, only a few related approaches can be found in the specialized literature.

{"title": "Gaining new fields of application for OOP: the parallel evolutionary algorithm case\n", "abstract": " Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is continuously gaining new domains of application. We address in this work a study of several important design and implementation issues in one of such new domains: parallel evolutionary algorithms (PEAs). These algorithms are heuristics aimed at performing search, optimization, and machine learning tasks. We will identify the potential and actual advantages of using OOP in such a field of application, as well as we propose a class design for solving complex real-world problems with PEAs. Besides the methodological and practical outcomes, some results showing the efficiency and flexibility of the resulting OOP-PEA systems are offered herein. We conclude that OOP allows quick PEA prototyping, integration of new techniques within the PEA, and easy cooperation with other techniques in parallel, all of this without reducing the efficiency of the resulting PEA.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["538"]}

Existing PSO algorithms for this permutation-based combinatorial problem use the Smaller Position Value (SPV) rule to transform continuous vectors into permutations of integers. However, this approach has limitations and is not suitable for this NP-hard problem. Here we propose a new discrete PSO that works directly in the search space of permutations and effectively addresses the fragment assembly problem. In our proposal, the fact that relative ordering of DNA fragments is most indicative of assembly accuracy is exploited in the particle update mechanism. This is implemented through a new operator called Probabilistic Edge Recombination (PER).

{"title": "A bi-population based scheme for an explicit exploration/exploitation trade-off in dynamic environments\n", "abstract": " Optimisation in changing environments is a challenging research topic since many real-world problems are inherently dynamic. Inspired by the natural evolution process, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are among the most successful and promising approaches that have addressed dynamic optimisation problems. However, managing the exploration/exploitation trade-off in EAs is still a prevalent issue, and this is due to the difficulties associated with the control and measurement of such a behaviour. The proposal of this paper is to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation in an explicit manner. The idea is to use two equally sized populations: the first one performs exploration while the second one is responsible for exploitation. These tasks are alternated from one generation to the next one in a regular pattern, so as to obtain a balanced search engine.

We want to use this to solve tasks useful for smart cities.

The usual goal of these navigators is to take the user in less time or distance to a destination. However, the global use of navigators in a given city could lead to traffic jams as they have a highly biased preference for some streets. From a general point of view, spreading the traffic throughout the city could be a way of preventing jams and making a better use of public resources. We propose a way of calculating alternative routes to be assigned by these devices in order to foster a better use of the streets.

Indeed, a PP system involves two adversary species where the predator\u2019s objective is to hunt the prey while the prey\u2019s objective is to escape from its predator. By analogy to dynamic optimization, a DOP can be seen as a predation between potential solution(s) in the search space, which represents the predator, and the moving optimum, as the prey. Therefore we define the dynamic predator-prey problem (DPP) whose objective is to keep track of the moving prey, so as to minimize the distance to the optimum. To solve this problem, a dynamic approach that continuously adapts to the changing environment is required.

As a consequence, the new algorithms allow scientists not only tackling current problems in an efficient way, but also facing tasks that were unsolvable in the past because of their prohibitive computational costs. In this context, researching on exact, ad hoc heuristic, and metaheuristic techniques has attracted a lot of attention nowadays. The reason is the increasing number of complex problems that are appearing in the industry and, at the same time, the availability of new better computational resources, such as efficient multicore cluster computers, cloud computing execution platforms, and other high performance environments. The main advantage of exact algorithms is that they can guarantee the finding of an optimal solution for any problem. However, despite an special emphasis still exists on that, there is a wealth of problems for which there are not exact algorithms able of computing an optimal solution in polynomial time, since the needed computing effort grows exponentially along with the problem dimension. Such a group of problems is usually referred to as NP-hard. In contrast, ad hoc heuristics are usually very fast in problem resolution, although obtaining in general moderate quality solutions.

{"title": "Exploring the accuracy of a parallel cooperative model for trajectory-based metaheuristics\n", "abstract": " Classical cooperative parallel models for metaheuristics have one major issue when the underlying search method is based on the exploration of the neighborhood of one single solution, i.e., a trajectory-based metaheuristic. Whenever a cooperation step takes place by exchanging solutions, either the incoming or the local solution has to be discarded because the subalgorithm does only work with one single solutions. Therefore, important information may be lost. A recent new parallel model for trajectory-based metaheuristics has faced this issue by adding a crossover operator that is aimed at combining valuable information from both the incoming and the local solution. This work is targeted to further evaluate this parallel model by addressing two well-known, hard optimization problems (MAXSAT and RND) using Simulated Annealing as the search method in each subalgorithm.

Solving these problems with evolutionary computation (EC) techniques requires deciding on what the best representations, operators, evaluation function, and parameters are. Furthermore, some complex problems need long computation times to evaluate the solutions proposed by the technique applied or even interaction with an expert. In those cases, it is necessary to decrease the number of evaluations made. One approach commonly used with population-based approaches is to reduce the number of individuals in the population. Micropopulations, which means at most 10 individuals, reduce the genetic diversity dramatically, diminishing the overall performance of the technique applied.

The diversity results are also interpreted in the light of their numerical and real-time behavior. Structuring the population in the form of a cellular and/or a distributed GA is shown to provide additional (problem-tunable) ways of sustaining diversity. Also, it is showed the independence of the diversity from the synchronization of the migration steps.

When applied to real problems, EAs provide a valuable relation between the quality of the solution and the efficiency in obtaining it; for this reason these techniques attracted the immediate attention of many researchers and became what they now represent: a cutting-edge approach to real-world optimization.

These types of problems are called dynamic optimization problems (DOPs). Dynamism in real-world problems can be attributed to several factors: some are natural (eg, weather conditions); others can be related to human behavior (eg, variation in aptitude of different individuals, inefficiency, absence, and sickness); and others are business related (eg, the addition of new orders and cancellation of old ones). Techniques that work for static problems may therefore not be effective for DOPs, which require algorithms that make use of old information to find new optima quickly.

However, many programmers use ASCII documents in such a way that the parameters and their values are written using ad-hoc rules, which lead to non-standard, difficult to understand and error prone information. In this paper we discuss different approaches to configure an algorithm by means of a text file. This is by no means a minor issue, since a proper configuration could lead to standardization, safety and algorithm interaction (eg cooperation).

But, what does we mean with \u201ccomplexity\u201d of a software piece? Basili [1] defines complexity as a measure of the resources used by a system while interacting with a piece of software to perform a given task. If the interacting system is a computer, then complexity is defined as the execution time and storage required to perform the computation described by the program. If the interacting system is a programmer then complexity is defined as the difficulty of performing tasks such as coding, debugging, testing or refactoring. In this abstract we propose a new meaning for complexity: the difficulty of testing a program.Such a measure of complexity, which we call Testing Complexity, could be useful to decide which is the best way of generating a test suite for the piece of work. It could be useful, for example, to decide the parameters of an evolutionary test data generator [3] prior to its execution. Our new complexity measure predicts the behaviour of an automatic test data generator based on random testing [2]. The measure is based on a Markov model of the program that is used for estimating the probability of traversing the branches of the program. In order to confirm the quality of our new complexity measure, we performed an empirical study using a benchmark of 1800 test programs automatically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["538"]}

{"title": "Evaluating New Advanced Multiobjective Metaheuristics\n", "abstract": " Many sectors of industry (eg, mechanical, chemistry, telecommunication, environment, transport) are concerned with large and complex problems that must be optimized. Such problems seldom have a single objective; on the contrary, they frequently have several contradictory criteria or objectives that must be satisfied simultaneously. Multiobjective optimization is a discipline focused on the resolution of these types of problems.As in single-objective optimization, the techniques to solve a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) can be classified into exact and approximate (also named heuristic) algorithms. Exact methods such as branch and bound [18, 22], the A* algorithm [20], and dynamic programming [2] are effective for problems of small size. When problems become more difficult, usually because of their NP-hard complexity, approximate algorithms are mandatory.

{"title": "DNA Fragment Assembly Using Grid Systems.\n", "abstract": " DNA fragment assembly is a technique that attempts to reconstruct the original DNA sequence from a large number of fragments, each one being several hundred base pairs (bps) long. The DNA fragment assembly is needed because current technology, such as gel electrophoresis, cannot directly and accurately sequence DNA molecules longer than 1000 bases. However, most genomes are much longer. For example, a human DNA is about 3.2 billion bps in length and cannot be read at once. The following technique was developed to deal with this limitation. First, the DNA molecule is amplified, that is, many copies of the molecule are created. The molecules are then cut at random sites to obtain fragments that are short enough to be sequenced directly. The overlapping fragments are then assembled back into the original DNA molecule. This strategy is called shotgun sequencing. Originally, the assembly of short fragments was done manually, which is inefficient and error-prone. Hence, a lot of effort has been put into finding techniques to automate the shotgun sequence assembly. Over the past decade a number of fragment assembly packages [1\u20133] have been developed and used to sequence different organisms. The assembly problem is, therefore, a combinatorial optimization problem that, even in the absence of noise, is NP-hard: given k fragments, there are 2kk! possible combinations. Therefore, if we consider large instances of the DNA fragment assembly problem, then the finding of the final sequence is a very time-consuming process, and even the total computing time can be, on the order of hundreds of days.

{"title": "Efficient batch job scheduling in grids using cellular memetic algorithms\n", "abstract": " Computational grids are an important emerging paradigm for large-scale distributed computing. As grid systems become more wide-spread, techniques for efficiently exploiting the large amount of grid computing resources become increasingly indispensable. A key aspect in order to benefit from these resources is the scheduling of jobs to grid resources. Due to the complex nature of grid systems, the design of efficient grid schedulers becomes challenging since such schedulers have to be able to optimize many conflicting criteria in very short periods of time. In this work we exploit the capabilities of cellular memetic algorithms (cMAs) for obtaining efficient batch schedulers for grid systems. A careful design of the cMA methods and operators for the problem yielded to an efficient and robust implementation. Our experimental study, based on a known static benchmark for the problem, shows that this heuristic approach is able to deliver very high quality planning of jobs to grid nodes and thus it can be used to design efficient dynamic schedulers for real grid systems. Such dynamic schedulers can be obtained by running the cMA-based scheduler in batch mode for a very short time to schedule jobs arriving to the system since the last activation of the cMA scheduler.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["538"]}
{"title": "Distributed coevolutionary genetic algorithm for optimal design of ad hoc injection networks\n", "abstract": " Multi-hop ad-hoc networks allow establishing local groups of communicating devices in a selforganizing way. However, in a global setting such networks fail to work properly due to network partitioning. This means that users locally interacting could eventually spread and move away from each other and consequently loose their connections. Considering that devices are capable of communicating both locally (eg using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) and additionally with remote devices (eg using GSM/UMTS links) the objective of our work is to optimize the way of inter-linking multiple network partitions. To this end we rely on smallworld network properties, that consist in using special attributes like the clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length. In this paper we investigate the use of a distributed Cooperative Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (CCGA) and compare its performance to a generational and a steady state genetic algorithm (genGa and ssGA) for optimizing one instance of this topology control problem and present initial evidence of its capacity to solve it.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["538"]}

{"title": "Convergence speed in multi-objective metaheuristics: efficiency criteria and empirical study\n", "abstract": " Solving optimization problems using a reduced number of objective function evaluations is an open issue in the design of multi-objective optimization metaheuristics. The usual approach to analyze the behavior of such multi-objective optimization metaheuristics is to choose a benchmark of known problems, to perform a certain (predetermined) number of function evaluations, and then, apply a set of performance indicators in order to assess the quality of the solutions obtained. However, this sort of methodology does not provide any insights of the efficiency of each algorithm. Here, efficiency is defined as the effort required by a multi-objective metaheuristic to obtain a set of non-dominated solutions that is satisfactory to the user, according to some pre-defined criterion. Indeed, the type of solutions of interest to the user may vary depending of the specific characteristics of the problem being solved. In this paper, the convergence speed of seven state-of-the-art multi-objective metaheuristics is analyzed, according to three pre-defined efficiency criteria. Our empirical study shows that PAES (based on an evolution strategy) is the fastest algorithm in terms of reaching a Pareto front that contains several Pareto optimal solutions. SMPSO (based on a particle swarm optimizer) and GDE3 (based on differential evolution) require the lowest number of function evaluations to obtain satisfactory approximations of the true Pareto front. When considering the three efficiency criteria, SMPSO is found to be the best overall algorithm on the test problems adopted.
