We contend that more emphasis is required on detailed process execution than is given proper due. Specifically, best practices are now emphasized in the software engineering profession over rigid process structures, and as educators we must respond to this cultural shift by teaching the role of best practices in a broader applied process context. Our approach in the Software Enterprise, our multi-year capstone sequence at Arizona State University Polytechnic, is to provide a process structure, teach best practices, and then give teamsjust enough rope'to resolve issues by leveraging the process, best practices, and soft skills.

{"title": "MHealth Games as Rewards: Incentive or Distraction?\n", "abstract": " Games may be employed for delivery of a clinical protocol, or as an incentive for protocol tasks. We focus on serious games in mHealth apps for pediatric patients with a chronic disease as an incentive for behavior modification. A patient is rewarded with enhanced gameplay in proportion to her/his compliance with a clinical protocol. The game-as-reward prevents fatigue and sustains patient engagement as the mHealth apps are used on a frequent basis when the affliction is a chronic disease. However, our experience shows a fine line between games that encourage engagement and ones that distract patients from protocol tasks.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["876"]}

During the process, we arrived at assumptions based on intrinsic and extrinsic influences that effected the design of the game. After creating a prototype, the game was provided to the target audience during a usability test. Our observations reveal that even after following a rigorous and agile development model that included stakeholders at several time frames, we were not successful in delivering the desired experience to our target audience. We conclude by presenting a strategy for changing the agile development model to be inclusive of the target audience.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["876"]}

This interface allows researchers remote access to vessel collection that can be analyzed from anywhere in the world. The interface is divided into two sections with right half supporting the ability to draw profile curve both symmetric and asymmetric. This query can be further refined using the left half which provides contextual based information. Using a curve-matching algorithm the software then searches the database and returns a series of potential matches sorted by the percentage of similarity between the curves. Each match can then be selected for more detailed viewing of the 3D model and data or for further analysis.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["876"]}

{"title": "Work in progress-the software enterprise\n", "abstract": " Computer science and software engineering programs are in a constant struggle to update curriculum content and instructional methodologies so graduates are better prepared to enter today's fast-paced technology sector. Despite these efforts, the general perception of industry remains that new graduates are ill equipped to perform their duties when entering the marketplace. We find our students are often caught between the academic mission to learn the science and the need to find gainful employment when they complete their degree requirements. Our response to this dilemma is the introduction of a four-semester capstone project sequence dubbed \"the software enterprise\".

Additional requirements for handling dynamic and distributed processes also push the limits of current process technology. This research proposes a component-based framework, the Open Process Components framework, for supporting process activities: building process models, executing process models, analyzing them, and evolving them.

Race, ethnicity, socio-cultural and economical barriers play a significant role towards this problem. Parental awareness is dependent on the above factors and has been shown to help reduce the risks and barriers associated with obesity. Targeted interventions become necessary to improve awareness in the affected population. In this chapter we look specifically at game-based interventions that are targeted and promote behavior change by increasing awareness. Awareness can be broken down into three parameters: attitudes, knowledge and acceptance. Those developing interventions have to be cognizant of these three parameters, include ways to measure and track these during the intervention, and adapt according to these measures.

The reasoning, in short, is that a highly iterative process with specific short-term goals can be instrumented to provide constant feedback to change and disruption. Agile methods focus on short iterations, adaptive work assignments, constant feedback, and process visibility to address the fundamental nature of complexity. The author is currently experimenting with agility in the classroom through the incorporation of these mechanisms and the support of online tools. Online tools can help in several ways, such as helping the instructor and teaching assistants scale up the agile teaching process.

{"title": "Assessing evolving conceptual knowledge in software engineering students\n", "abstract": " Is it more important to \u201ccollect more knowledge\u201d or to gain an understanding of how concepts relate so that a sustainable learning structure is formed? Active learning proponents would suggest it is more important to create a durable conceptual foundation by which new experiences are assimilated to grow the personal knowledge base in an orderly, well-formed way. But how can one assess that this is happening? In our project-centric courses we have adopted concept maps as a technique for evaluating the evolution of student understanding of conceptual knowledge in software engineering. This paper motivates the application of this existing technique in software engineering education, and presents a concept mapping assessment protocol based on a unique expert ranking process. An instance of the protocol implementation with results is presented and preliminary conclusions drawn.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["876"]}
{"title": "The benefits of transparency in managing software engineering capstone projects\n", "abstract": " This paper describes the impact of an agile process support environment in helping faculty manage software engineering capstone projects and the learning outcomes associated with the capstone experience. Software engineering capstone projects are notoriously time-consuming to manage for faculty mentors. Team projects often fall behind due to the inexperience of the students and the external pressures they face. They may be accustomed to performing heroic acts on prior individual class projects, and think they can be successful this way again. But in a significantly sized real-world team project, they find out too late that this approach will not work. Students remain successful often by significant effort on the part of a faculty mentor. The mentor may setup a process infrastructure to enables project monitoring. Mentors may find themselves asking for frequent in-class project reviews, out-of-class appointments, and significant documentation. Mentoring a capstone project, while a potentially rewarding experience, can become a significant time sink and lead to faculty burnout. We are utilizing the IBM Jazz environment including the Rational Team Concert (RTC) integrated development environment (IDE) to address project management for capstone projects using the Agile/Scrum methodology. Jazz/RTC allows all stakeholders (students, sponsors, and faculty) to transparently review a process to assess project health at any point in time. Further, transparent continuous project monitoring gives mentors the ability to provide just-in-time-but-not-too-late formative feedback, as well as allow continuous assessment of learning outcomes.

Many open source projects rely on skilled development teams whose members are distributed throughout the world. Often, agile development methods are employed by these teams, as the focus is on concurrent development and fast production over requirements management and quality assurance. The image-guided surgery toolkit (IGSTK) is an open source development project that relies on the collaboration of a skilled and distributed development team, yet addresses a domain that demands managing requirements as well as implementing a high degree of robustness and addressing safety concerns. Due to this unique cross-section of open source technology and the surgical domain, the IGSTK team has developed a set of best practices and requirements techniques to augment commonly applied agile methods.

{"title": "A flexible marker-passer for semantically weak search\n", "abstract": " New challenges posed in many areas of AI research represent a departure from domain-specific applications-to systems that can more effectively cope with larger and more uncertain domains. Such knowledge intensive applications require the easy and efficient utilization of tremendous amounts of knowledge. The magnitude of knowledge and often stringent response constraints that characterize such applications poses a computationally prohibitive search problem. A proposed technique for addressing this problem is a parallel search technique known as marker-passing. Past work in markerpassers has shown they often return too much information, becoming a bottleneck of the system in which they are embedded. This paper presents the design of a flexible marker-passing mechanism embedded in a commonsense reasoning model, RABIT (_Reasoning About Beliefs In Time), which overcomes this difficulty\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["876"]}
