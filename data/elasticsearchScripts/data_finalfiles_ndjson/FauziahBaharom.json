{"title": "Development of e-commerce quality and evaluation framework based on technical and user perspectives\n", "abstract": " This research aims to construct a quality framework for effective website applications specifically for B-to-C e-commerce application that hopefully can guarantee the development of quality software in the organisations in this industry.Finding from previous studies indicate that this problem occurs because of ignorance of consumer needs in their websites development.The proposed framework consists of two main attributes of quality: the behavioural and the user aspect.The behavioural attributes deals with assessing e-commerce in technical aspects to ensure the quality of the software.While the user aspect deal with user expectation and satisfaction toward quality e-commerce application.These two components of quality produce a balance model between technical requirement and human factor.The objectives of this research are to investigate and identify e-commerce evaluation attributes based on user\u2019s perspective, to identify evaluation attributes based on e-commerce application behaviour (technical) perspective, to design an architecture of attribute\u2019s measures and metrics and to construct a new integrated e-commerce evaluation framework based on users and technical perspectives.The research will be conducted in four main phases which include: 1) the theoretical and empirical study; 2) design the architecture of attributes, measures and metrics; 3) construction of an integrated e-commerce quality evaluation framework, and 4) confirmation study.The framework will provide a complete mechanism for assessing e-commerce B-2-C application.This research will offer missing factors for e-commerce assessment from consumer perspectives\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2246"]}
{"title": "Software product certification: A collaborative perspective approach\n", "abstract": " In this information age, most businesses are highly dependent on the availability of ICT services, especially on software application components. The interest on the acquisition of a high quality software has increased among various stakeholders. However, some pertaining problems are still being debated such as:(i) determining the quality of software product;(ii) defining mechanism for assessing software product quality;(iii) ensuring and offering software quality guarantee; and (iv) ensuring the continuous improvement of quality of software product. Users concern with the quality of software delivered and they expect software are in good quality that meet their prescribed standard. Therefore, a practical mechanism for assessment and certification is required to resolve these uncertainties. Findings from previous empirical study conducted in Malaysia agreed that with certification embedded and granted to the software might resolve the uncertainties and suspicion on the status and standing of software product. Based on survey and literature findings, main quality attributes have been identified which are crucial to the proposed certification framework. Two distinct models of certification are developed ie SCfM_prod and SPAC based on product and process quality approaches respectively. This paper focuses on software certification model based on product quality approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2246"]}
{"title": "Knowledge transfer in problem based learning teaching method in software engineering education: A measurement model\n", "abstract": " Problem Based Learning (PBL) is a teaching method that is able to transfer tacit knowledge from lecturers to students based on Socialization, Externalization, Combination and Internalization (SECI) model. However, the SECI model does not include the students\u2019 performance factor, which is an indicator to measure the effectiveness of teaching and learning processes. Hence, our study proposes a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of using PBL as a teaching method in Software Engineering (SE) education to transfer the tacit knowledge by enhancing the SECI model. This paper is a part of our study that purposely wants to evaluate a measurement model of knowledge transfer process in PBL teaching method in SE education. This study used survey as a method for data collection. The respondents were students who registered for System Analysis and Design (SAD) courses. The data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). The results have shown that the measurement model fits the data. Therefore, the framework is suitable for PBL teaching method in SE education. Further, this study intends to identify the relationship between SECI model in PBL teaching method for SE domain.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2246"]}
{"title": "A Comparison Study of Software Testing Activities in Agile Methods\n", "abstract": " Nowadays the majority of companies in the world are adopting Agile methodology for developing their software products due to the methodology promises to deliver product faster with good quality. The most significant method for checking the quality of a product is software testing. However, in Agile development, software testing is very complex and still has challenges. This is largely happened because the Agile development does not concentrate much on software testing activities. It focuses on customer involvement, short iterations, and regular deliveries. This study is a comprehensive review of the current practices of software testing in the Agile methods. The comparison is made based on some criteria such as change during iteration, acceptance criteria, and quality assurance activities. The aim is to identify the similarities and differences between these methods especially in creating test cases. The study focuses on three common Agile methods which are XP, Scrum and Kanban. The review shows no difference in the techniques for designing test cases between these three methods. This result can contribute to help the developers and testers who adopt Agile methodology to follow the same rule of creating test cases based on the suitable technique in different Agile methods.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2246"]}
{"title": "Requirement Model for Supporting Learning of Human Body in Science Subject Using Augmented Reality in Malaysia Primary School\n", "abstract": " This paper focuses on a requirement model based on a study on a new form of Virtual Reality (VR) application known as Augmented Reality (AR) technology in education domain. The requirement model is constructed as a guideline in the process of development of AR prototype according to the education domain requirements. AR sets itself apart from VR by allowing integration of 3D virtual objects into real environment in real time thus allowing student to relate to their physical environment and also making the subject more interesting. It is hoped that by implementing AR in Science learning helps to counter the declining interest in Science subject in Malaysian public schools particularly in suburb area.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2246"]}
