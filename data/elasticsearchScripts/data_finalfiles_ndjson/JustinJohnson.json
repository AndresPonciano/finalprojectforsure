{"title": "On the simple economics of advertising, marketing, and product design\n", "abstract": " We propose a framework for analyzing transformations of demand. Such transformations frequently stem from changes in the dispersion of consumers' valuations, which lead to rotations of the demand curve. In many settings, profits are a U-shaped function of dispersion. High dispersion is complemented by niche production, and low dispersion is complemented by mass-market supply. We investigate numerous applications, including product design; advertising, marketing and sales advice; and the construction of quality-differentiated product lines. We also suggest a new taxonomy of advertising, distinguishing between hype, which shifts demand, and real information, which rotates demand.", "num_citations": "665\n", "authors": ["904"]}

This is so whether revenue-sharing lowers or raises industry profits.

Two different revenue models are considered, one in which platforms set final retail prices and one in which the suppliers set final retail prices. Platforms have long-term (or strategic) pricing incentives but suppliers do not, which implies that the inter-temporal price path faced by consumers depends on the revenue model in place. When suppliers set prices instead of platforms, prices may be higher in early periods but lower in later periods, suggesting that appropriate antitrust enforcement ought to consider more than initial price changes when an industry shifts to the agency model. Indeed, consumers may (but need not) prefer the agency model even when prices increase in initial periods.

We allow sellers to use Q-learning algorithms (a common reinforcement-learning technique from the computer-science literature) to devise pricing strategies in a setting with repeated interactions, and consider the effect of platform rules that reward firms that cut prices with additional exposure to consumers. Overall, the evidence from our experiments suggests that platform design decisions can meaningfully benefit consumers even when algorithmic collusion might otherwise emerge but that achieving these gains may require more than the simplest steering policies when algorithms value the future highly. We also find that policies that raise consumer surplus can raise the profits of the platform, depending on the platform's revenue model. Finally, we document several learning challenges faced by the algorithms.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["904"]}

A corollary is this: a monopolist who naively ignores the substitutability of her products, by choosing the standalone monopoly price for each quality, successfully implements the optimal discriminatory scheme. Under other reasonable specifications, the equilibrium prices are close to the single-product prices.

Building on recent theoretical research, we construct a model of the leasing decision in which leasing mitigates adverse selection and reduces transaction costs, but moral hazard limits its use. In our model, the prevalence of leasing is related to new-car reliability, which suggests that the recent growth in leasing is at least partly due to improvements in new-car reliability. We use this model to derive testable implications and then conduct an empirical analysis to investigate whether the operation of the new- and used-car markets is consistent with the predictions of this theoretical approach.

{"title": "Understanding AI Collusion and Compliance\n", "abstract": " Antitrust compliance scholarship, particularly with a focus on collusion, has been an area of study for some time. Changes in technology and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning create new possibilities both for anti-competitive behavior and to aid in detection of such algorithmic collusion. To some extent, AI collusion takes traditional ideas of collusion and simply provides a technological overlay to them. However, in some instances, the mechanisms of both collusion and detection can be transformed using AI. This handbook chapter discusses existing theoretical and empirical work, and identifies research gaps as well as avenues for new scholarship on how firms or competition authorities might invest in AI compliance to improve detection of wrong doing. We suggest where AI collusion is possible and offer new twists to where prior work has not identified possible collusion. Specifically, we identify the importance of AI to address the \u201ctrust\u201d issue in collusion. We also identify that AI collusion is possible across non-price dimensions, such as manipulated product reviews and ratings, and discuss potential screens involving co-movements of prices and ratings. We further emphasize that AI may encourage entry, which may limit collusive prospects. Finally, we discuss how AI can be used to help with compliance both at the firm level and by competition authorities.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["904"]}

{"title": "Anticompetitive exclusive dealing without exclusion\n", "abstract": " I present a new theory of anticompetitive exclusive dealing. In it, exclusive deals do not serve to disadvantage rivals or exclude them from the market. In equilibrium, it is often the case that multiple suppliers each form their own exclusive networks, with other downstream firms remaining unaffiliated. Despite the lack of exclusion and competitor harm, competition is harmed: exclusive deals raise all prices and harm consumers. Both retailers and suppliers may benefit from the increase in industry profits. Indeed, exclusive deals may allow suppliers of homogenous goods to earn positive profits, whereas they would earn zero in the absence of exclusive deals.In this article I present a new theory of anticompetitive exclusive dealing. In it, individual suppliers producing homogenous goods endogenously persuade imperfectly competitive retailers to enter into exclusive relations with them, resulting in disjoint networks of retailers, each of which is affiliated with a single supplier. Strikingly, exclusive deals serve neither to exclude nor disadvantage rivals. Rather, such deals provide each exclusive supplier with the incentive and ability to internalize competition amongst the retailers in its network. The equilibrium effect is that all retail prices increase, which may benefit both suppliers and retailers, but unambiguously harms consumers.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["904"]}
{"title": "Open Source Software\n", "abstract": " Over the past decade there has been an explosion of interest among economists and other academicians in open source software (OSS). 1 In this chapter I provide a discussion and selective survey of the topic from an Economics perspective. Along the way I also touch on issues related to the openness of platforms. Although strong academic interest among economists has emerged only in the past decade, the phenomenon of OSS is much older, arguably beginning with Richard M. Stallman\u2019s formation of the GNU and Free Software Foundation organizations in 1983 and 1985, respectively, and growing more visible with the emergence of the Linux and BSD operating systems in the early 1990s. While giving software away for free and even sharing source code was not new to the 1980s by any means, the innovation of Stallman and others was to take steps (primarily in the form of licenses, as discussed later) to ensure that their intellectual property could not be expropriated by others, so that it would grow in the public domain thanks to the contributions of unpaid volunteers. Today, the OSS movement is widely credited with creating a diverse set of reliable, high-quality, and popular software products.It is tempting, perhaps especially as an economist, to think of OSS as puzzling or mysterious. After all, while profit motives may in some cases be present amongst OS developers, such motives are typically indirect and, arguably, mostly absent in many cases. 2 However, I suggest that this temptation to view OSS thusly be resisted: insisting that OSS is a mystery is both wrong and detracts from the more important role and meaning of the movement.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["904"]}

{"title": "Essays in microeconomic theory\n", "abstract": " Three essays are presented which explore how strategic decision-making on a micro level translates into macro effects. Careful attention is paid to how asymmetric information and free-riding exert strong influences on t.he behavior of individuals. In the first chapter, a simple model of open-source software development is presented. It is found that either too little development or redundant development effort can occur. While any redundant research effort grows slowly with the size of the community, projects for which user valuations arc sufficiently extreme, such as solutions to the Year 2000 Computer Problem (Y2K), will result in significant waste relative to a traditional closed-source environment. Correlations between value and cost are shown to resolve the empirical puzzle as to why some extremely useful and fairly simple software docs not get written while more complex software sometimes docs. It is shown that a modular design can improve or worsen the performance of an open-source community. In the second chapter, an industry is considered in which new firms require time to learn whether they have the \"right stuff\" to grow in size and profitability in the long run. The critical input market ( that for skilled labor) is imperfectly competitive. By extending the literate on nonstationary dynamic bargaining, analysis is performed on a set of intertemporal externalities exerted by future parties on today's parties, and vice versa.
