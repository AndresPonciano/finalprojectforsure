{"title": "Agile\u2013Is it Suitable for Medical Device Software Development?\n", "abstract": " Medical device software is typically developed through adopting a prescribed plan driven software development lifecycle approach based upon variations of the waterfall or V-Model. Organisations wishing to satisfy regulations have to define software development processes and also that these processes have been implemented throughout the complete development lifecycle. Agile development techniques report to offer solutions within other industries that would solve challenges encountered within the medical device industry. However, there are some concerns with using agile for medical device software development in relation to satisfying the regulatory bodies. In this short paper, we highlight the issues in traditional medical device software development. Secondly, we discuss the challenges and highlight agile practices that have been successfully adopted in the medical device software industry.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1389"]}

{"title": "A hybrid assessment approach for medical device software development companies\n", "abstract": " Medical device software development organizations are bound by regulatory requirements and constraints to ensure that developed medical devices will not harm patients. Medical devices have to be treated as complete systems and be evaluated in this manner. Instead of manufacturers having to ensure compliance to various regulatory standards individually, the authors previously developed a medical device software process assessment framework called MDevSPICE\u00ae that integrates the regulatory requirements from all the relevant medical device software standards. The MDevSPICE\u00ae was developed in a manner that suits plan\u2010driven software development. To improve the usability of MDevSPICE\u00ae in agile settings, we extended the assessment approach. The hybrid assessment approach described here combines the MDevSPICE\u00ae\u2010based process assessment method with steps for prioritization of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1389"]}
{"title": "How Does Scrum Conform to the Regulatory Requirements Defined in MDevSPICE\u00ae?\n", "abstract": " Medical device software development is subject to high regulations due to the potential risk of harming patients with unsafe medical devices. These regulations require software development to be performed with high discipline and evidence to be provided for auditory purposes. It\u2019s not easy to manage both conformance to regulations and efficiency in medical device development. Therefore, there is a transition towards agility in safety critical systems development, to build high quality systems, shorten time to market, improve customer and employee satisfaction and ensure both safety and reliability. In this study, we evaluated one of the most highly adopted agile software development methods, Scrum from a regulatory perspective. We investigated to what extend the regulatory requirements defined in MDevSPICE\u00ae are met with implementation of the Scrum method and what additional processes and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1389"]}
{"title": "Functional similarity impact on the relation between functional size and software development effort\n", "abstract": " In this study, we identified one of the reasons of the low correlation between functional size and development effort which is overlooking the similarity of the functions during the mapping of the functional size and development effort. We developed a methodology (SiRFuS) that is based on the idea of the reuse of the similar functions internally to provide high correlation between functional size and development effort. The method is developed for the identification of the similar functions based on the method of Santillo and Abran. Similarity percentages among the functional processes and Similarity Reflective Functional Sizes are computed to attain adjusted functional sizes. The similarity reflective functional sizes were named as Discrete Similarity Reflective Functional Size and Continuous Similarity Reflective Functional Size based on the characteristics of the adjusted functional sizes. The SiRFuS method consists of three stages: measurement of the software product with COSMIC Functional Size Measurement (FSM) method; identification of the functional similarities bases on the measurement results and calculation of the similarity reflective functional sizes. In order to facilitate the detection of similar functions, calculation of the percentage of the similarities and similarity reflective functional sizes; a software tool is developed based on the SiRFuS method. Two case studies were performed in order to identify the improvement opportunities and evaluate the applicability of the method and the tool.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1389"]}

{"title": "Agilitymod: a software agility reference model for agility assessment\n", "abstract": " Agile software development methodologies have gained significant interest in IT community proposing solutions to problems of traditional, plan-driven software development approaches. However, not every organization that tries to adopt agile methods succeeds, that is mostly because practitioners misinterpret the agile values, principles or practices during the adoption and transformation or see a single agile method as a complete solution to all problems. There is a gap in the field to assist software organizations in assessing their agility levels and introducing roadmaps in adopting agile principles/practices. In this thesis study we propose a Software Agility Assessment Reference Model that will be used for assessing organizations\u2019 position in agility and indicating the gaps that prevents fully obtaining the benefits of agile software development and providing roadmaps to roadmaps to organizations in adopting agile principles/practices. The model is based on the meta-model structure of ISO/IEC 15504-Process Assessment Standard to create a common basis for performing assessments of agility and present the assessment results using a common rating scale. We performed exploratory case studies and obtained the opinions of the experts to improve the Model. Validation of the proposed model is achieved through one of the qualitative research methods, case studies. We performed a multiple case study including six cases for validation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1389"]}

{"title": "Agile medical device software development: introducing agile practices into MDevSPICE\u00ae\n", "abstract": " Medical device software is usually embedded within the overall system as one of the sub-systems. It needs to be integrated with other sub-systems such as the electrical and mechanical for a functional medical device to be developed. In order to develop a working medical device system through integrating its sub-systems, the sub-systems\u2019 requirements have to be derived from the overall medical device system requirements. The system requirements are continuously collected, analysed and built from the needs of different stakeholders such as patients, health professionals and other companies offering relevant devices, interfaces and software related to the medical device system under development. Various regulatory requirements have to be achieved for a medical device to be allowed market access.
