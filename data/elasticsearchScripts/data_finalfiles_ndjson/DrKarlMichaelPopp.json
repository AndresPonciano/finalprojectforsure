{"title": "Finding the unicorn: Predicting early stage startup success through a hybrid intelligence method\n", "abstract": " Artificial intelligence is an emerging topic and will soon be able to perform decisions better than humans. In more complex and creative contexts such as innovation, however, the question remains whether machines are superior to humans. Machines fail in two kinds of situations: processing and interpreting \u201csoft\u201d information (information that cannot be quantified) and making predictions in \u201cunknowable risk\u201d situations of extreme uncertainty. In such situations, the machine does not have representative information for a certain outcome. Thereby, humans are still the \u201cgold standard\u201d for assessing \u201csoft\u201d signals and make use intuition. To predict the success of startups, we, thus, combine the complementary capabilities of humans and machines in a Hybrid Intelligence method. To reach our aim, we follow a design science research approach to develop a Hybrid Intelligence method that combines the strength of both machine and collective intelligence to demonstrate its utility for predictions under extreme uncertainty.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["755"]}

This affects software ecosystems and the way software vendors interact and manage their partners. In order to explore on the impacts, we conducted a single-case study by examining a globally leading software vendor of both, traditional on-premises software as well as cloud solutions. The study reveals new insights on how the SaaS revolution impacts partner management within software ecosystems from a vendor perspective, for instance that successful cloud partners may not necessarily come from a cloud background.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["755"]}
{"title": "Best Practices for commercial use of open source software: Business models\n", "abstract": " This book enables you to leverage the state-of-the-art of creating open source based business models and of managing open source in the development cycle of commercial software and during due diligence in mergers and acquisitions. In addition, it provides information about why investments in open source makes sense. Practitioners, investors and consultants created this book to help professionals in the software business like investors, executives, business developers, product managers, architects, developers, quality managers, development operations managers as well as students to get acquainted and proficient in using open source products in a commercial context. First, the focus is on business model impact of open source products and open source licenses. Dr. Karl Michael Popp gives an overview of the different types of business models for open source companies. Dr. Josef Waltl shows how open source licenses and intellectual property strategies can create a unique business model based on a combination of open source and proprietary software. Then, the focus is on detection and license compliance aspects of open source software in mergers and acquisitions. The acquisition of a software vendor requires the review of intellectual property rights including open source license compliance as described by Dr. Karl Michael Popp. The following new chapter, authored by Joseph Jacks from OSS Capital, provides fundamentals of the open source business by elaborating on value creation and value capture for commercial open source companies. Then, two chapters cover the offerings of tool vendors for governance of open source\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["755"]}

One area where it is used is in implementing standard business application systems. In such projects, reference models provide valuable support to enterprises when they are creating the business process models that describe their enterprise. Reference business process models give an overview of the business processes that are supported by the system, and in doing so they help select the processes to be applied in an enterprise. However, it has been much more difficult to make use of business process models when you were setting parameters that change the behaviour of a standard business application system accordingly. It is described how the architecture of reference business process models can be extended to support the setting of parameters in a standard business application system.

Analyzing the Nature and Consequences of Complementors\u00b4 Costs in Platform Ecosystems\n", "abstract": " Platforms enable third-parties to develop new software artefacts like applications and become the locus of digital innovation. Prior studies have mainly focused on the benefits that initially motivate external complementors to join an ecosystem. However, little is known about the costs that are associated with this choice and how such costs actually influence the decision to interrelate with a platform owner. We develop the overarching idea that the complementor\u00b4s costs are mainly influenced by the interplay of the micro-architecture of single extensions and control modes applied to govern the ecosystem. The purpose of our research is therefore to shed light on the nature of complementors\u2019 costs on the micro-level of transactions between the platform owner and the complementor and their effects on the intention to join an ecosystem. Using data from a quantitative survey among complementors of five leading platforms in the Enterprise Application Software industry hypothesized relationships are tested.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["755"]}

{"title": "Merging Platform Ecosystems in Technology Acquisitions: a Governance Perspective.\n", "abstract": " This paper investigates the issue of merging third-party ecosystems in corporate acquisitions to access innovative technologies and related capabilities. Extant explanations for how technology acquisitions create value are limited to the analysis of the internal capabilities and structures of the merging companies. Given the increasing importance of platforms and value co-creation with third-party providers for companies making technology acquisitions, we complement existing literature by reframing the analysis of technology acquisitions to include the merger of the broader partner ecosystems. Specifically, we draw on theories of ecosystem governance to analyze how ecosystem tensions unfolded during the ecosystem merger and how the acquirer governed these tensions in SAP SE\u2019s acquisition of the e-commerce provider Hybris AG. Our findings suggest that the governance of ecosystem tensions is an important aspect of managing technology acquisitions. We identify the pre-acquisition relation between the acquired company\u2019s ecosystem partners and the acquirer as an important context factor for explaining how a partner company is exposed to the ecosystem tensions during the merger.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["755"]}

Two examples of ecosystem participant clusters are partnership models and membership models. An ecosystem participant cluster consists of a set of commitments between cluster owner and participant, this paper discusses the identifying characteristics of those commitments. A taxonomy is created to describe the structure of an ecosystem participant cluster. This taxonomy includes the role fulfilled by the participant within this commitment, also including the dimension of the role as well as resulting benefits, requirements and costs. Furthermore, the taxonomy and three case studies form the basis for a classification of ecosystem participant clusters, using a set of characteristics to identify the main differences between clusters used within the industry.

In this study, the product software acquisition process has been defined and the determinants have been identified. Experts evaluated and assessed the acquisition determinants and the acquisition process, in order to find a critical determinant for each respective phase.
