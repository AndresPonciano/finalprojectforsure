{"title": "An approach for matching communication patterns in parallel applications\n", "abstract": " Interprocessor communication is an important factor in determining the performance scalability of parallel systems. The communication requirements of a parallel application can be quantified to understand its communication pattern and communication pattern similarities among applications can be determined. This is essential for the efficient mapping of applications on parallel systems and leads to better interprocessor communication implementation among others. This paper proposes a methodology to compare the communication pattern of distributed-memory programs. Communication correlation coefficient quantifies the degree of similarity between two applications based on the communication metrics selected to characterize the applications. To capture the network topology requirements, we extract the communication graph of each applications and quantities this similarity.

{"title": "Tackling mode collapse in multi-generator GANs with orthogonal vectors\n", "abstract": " Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used to generate realistic-looking instances. However, training robust GAN is a non-trivial task due to the problem of mode collapse. Although many GAN variants are proposed to overcome this problem, they have limitations. Those existing studies either generate identical instances or result in negative gradients during training. In this paper, we propose a new approach to training GAN to overcome mode collapse by employing a set of generators, an encoder and a discriminator. A new minimax formula is proposed to simultaneously train all components in a similar spirit to vanilla GAN. The orthogonal vector strategy is employed to guide multiple generators to learn different information in a complementary manner. In this way, we term our approach Multi-Generator Orthogonal GAN (MGO-GAN). Specifically, the synthetic data produced by those generators\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2175"]}

Traditionally, they aim at predicting the existence of social relationships based on cyber interactions (e.g. online conversation) among users. However, the strength information of social relationships is not captured which is as important as the topology information of social communities. Furthermore, physical interactions (e.g., face to face conversation), which have the potential to reflect more realistic state of social relationships than cyber ones, are not taken into account in social relationship measurement. In order to measure the strength of social relationships, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical entropy-based relationship\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2175"]}
{"title": "Sketch-then-edit generative adversarial network\n", "abstract": " Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been widely used to generate impressively plausible data. However, it is a non-trivial task to train the original GAN model in practice due to the vanishing gradient problem. This is because the JS divergence could be a constant (i.e., log2) when original data distribution and generated data distribution hold a negligible overlapping area. Under such a scenario, the gradient of generator is 0. Most efforts have been devoted to designing a more proper difference measure while few attentions have been paid to the former aspect of the issue.In this paper, we propose a new method to design a noise distribution having a guaranteed non-negligible overlapping area with raw data distribution. The key idea is to transform the noise from the randomized space into the raw data space.

As a typical task of time series mining, Time Series Classification (TSC) has attracted lots of attention from both researchers and domain experts due to its broad applications ranging from human activity recognition to smart city governance. Specifically, there is an increasing requirement for performing classification tasks on diverse types of time series data in a timely manner without costly hand-crafting feature engineering.

To envision the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) and better support the transmission of the explosive vehicular data, the Ultra High Frequency(UHF) spectrum resource in TV White Space (TVWS) band is re-utilized to provide cognitively wireless access for vehicle users. The TVWS access can provide high throughput and wide coverage due to its wide bandwidth and penetrability. However, there remains a critical issue for vehicles to dynamically change the link rate for the egress frames to adapt to the channel variance. In this paper, we investigate deep learning based rate adaptation (RA) scheme for the vehicle users accessing to the TVWS band.
