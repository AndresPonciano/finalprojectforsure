{"title": "Industry practices and event logging: Assessment of a critical software development process\n", "abstract": " Practitioners widely recognize the importance of event logging for a variety of tasks, such as accounting, system measurements and troubleshooting. Nevertheless, in spite of the importance of the tasks based on the logs collected under real workload conditions, event logging lacks systematic design and implementation practices. The implementation of the logging mechanism strongly relies on the human expertise. This paper proposes a measurement study of event logging practices in a critical industrial domain. We assess a software development process at Selex ES, a leading Finmeccanica company in electronic and information solutions for critical systems. Our study combines source code analysis, inspection of around 2.3 millions log entries, and direct feedback from the development team to gain process-wide insights ranging from programming practices, logging objectives and issues impacting log analysis\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["1416"]}

{"title": "Operating system support to detect application hangs\n", "abstract": " On-line failure detection is an essential means to control and assess the dependability of complex and critical software systems. In such context, effective detection strategies are required, in order to minimize the possibility of catastrophic consequences. This objective is however difficult to achieve in complex systems, especially due to the several sources of non-determinism (e.g., multi-threading and distributed interaction) which may lead to software hangs, i.e., the system is active but no longer capable of delivering its services. The paper proposes a detection approach to uncover application hangs. It exploits multiple indirect data gathered at the operating system level to monitor the system and to trigger alarms if the observed behavior deviates from the expected one. By means of fault injection experiments conducted on a research prototype, it is shown how the combination of several operating system monitors actually leads to an high quality of detection, at an acceptable overhead.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1416"]}

There is a clear lack of easy/ready-to-use WSN technologies and tools for planning, implementing, testing and commissioning WSN systems in an integrated fashion. While there exists a plethora of papers about network planning and deployment methodologies, to the best of our knowledge none of them helps the designer to match coverage requirements with network performance evaluation. In this paper we aim at filling this gap by presenting an unified toolset, ie, a framework able to provide a global picture of the system, from the network deployment planning to system test and validation.

{"title": "OS-level hang detection in complex software systems\n", "abstract": " Many critical services are nowadays provided by large and complex software systems. However, the increasing complexity introduces several sources of non-determinism, which may lead to   hang failures  : the system appears to be running, but part of its services is perceived as unresponsive. Online monitoring is the only way to detect and to promptly react to such failures. However, when dealing with off-the-shelf-based systems, online detection can be tricky since instrumentation and log data collection may not be feasible in practice. In this paper, a detection framework to cope with software hangs is proposed. The framework enables the non-intrusive monitoring of complex systems, based on multiple sources of data gathered at the operating system (OS) level. Collected data are then combined to reveal hang failures. The framework is evaluated through a fault injection campaign on two complex systems from\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1416"]}

This work comes from an industrial experience aiming at exploiting the cloud potential for virtualizing complex infrastructures such as an entire Air Traffic Center (ATC), a clear example of complex SoS (System of Systems). The use of virtualization is convenient because industry can leverage in-house test-beds to perform distributed testing campaigns in pre-operational phases or to design new automatic fail-over mechanisms for fully distributed systems. In order to realize such mitigation and recovery techniques in the ATC field, indeed, a cloud platform is required to guarantee a low VM provisioning time with the objective of minimizing the service disruption.

They allow detecting bugs (as memory leak, accessing arrays out of bounds, etc..), structural errors and preventing entire classes of errors. This work refers to the Parasoft's tool\" C++ test\". It helps developers prevent and eliminate defects using rules tuned to nd code patterns that lead to reliability, performance, and security problems. To be practical, the static analysis must be seamlessly in-tegrated into the team's work-ow. The\"continuous static analysis\"'allows executing automatically the analysis when the new code is released. In this way is possible to realize a further automation in the software development executing the tool during the night or weekend. The time saved to run the tool can be used to analyze and correct the bugs. When you deal with static analysis, it's important to under-line the problem of false positive.

Errors are detected in the first phase, exploiting the operating system support. Faults are identified during the location phase, through a machine learning based approach. Then, the best recovery action is triggered once the fault is located. Feedback actions are also used during the location phase to improve detection quality over time. A real world application from the Air Traffic Control field has been used as case study for evaluating the proposed approach. Experimental results, achieved by means of fault injection, show that the diagnosis engine is able to diagnose faults with high accuracy and at a low overhead.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1416"]}

Middleware solutions compliant with the novel OMG standard, called Data Distribution Service (DDS), are being traditionally used for architecting large-scale systems, because they well meet the requirements of scalability, seamless decoupling and fault tolerance. Due to such features, industrial practitioners are enforcing the adoption of such middleware solutions also within the context of critical systems. However, these systems pose serious dependability requirements, which in turn demand DDS compliant products also to realize reliable data dissemination in different and heterogeneous contexts.

However, despite its wide use over the last four decades on a large variety of systems, field data analysis has rarely been applied to wireless networks. Users accessing the Internet ubiquitously through these networks are increasing, and they expect the same dependability level they already experience on wired networks. But how can we analyze the dependability level of a wireless network? The article defines a novel combined approach to model and analyze the dependability of short range wireless technologies exploiting field data. Through the experience gained from extensive failure analysis of Bluetooth networks, the paper shows how field failure data can play a key role to fill the gap on understanding the dependability behavior of wireless networks.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1416"]}
