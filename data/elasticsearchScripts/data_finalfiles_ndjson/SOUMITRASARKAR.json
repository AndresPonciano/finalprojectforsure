Combined fits to CMS UE proton-proton (pp) data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and to UE proton-antiproton (p p-bar) data from the CDF experiment at lower sqrt(s), are used to study the UE models and constrain their parameters, providing thereby improved predictions for proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. In addition, it is investigated whether the values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE observables are consistent with the values determined from fitting observables sensitive to double-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons of the UE tunes to \"minimum bias\" (MB) events, multijet, and Drell-Yan (q q-bar to Z / gamma* to lepton-antilepton + jets) observables at 7 and 8 TeV are presented, as well as predictions for MB and UE observables at 13 TeV.", "num_citations": "2375\n", "authors": ["6"]}

{"title": "Identification of heavy-flavour jets with the CMS detector in pp collisions at 13 TeV\n", "abstract": " The success of the physics programme of the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC requires the particles created in the LHC collisions to be reconstructed and identified as accurately as possible. With the exception of the top quark, quarks and gluons produced in pp collisions develop a parton shower and eventually hadronize giving rise to jets of collimated particles observed in the CMS detector. Heavy-flavour jet identification techniques exploit the properties of the hadrons in the jet to discriminate between jets originating from b or c quarks (heavy-flavour jets) and those originating from light-flavour quarks or gluons (light-flavour jets). The CMS Collaboration presented in ref.[1] a set of b jet identification techniques used in physics analyses performed on LHC Run 1 pp collision data, collected in 2011 and 2012 at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV.

Poor long term patency of prosthetic materials is due to distal anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. Intimal hyperplasia is directly linked to shear stress abnormalities at the vessel wall. Compliance and calibre mismatch between native vessel and graft, as well as anastomotic line stress concentration contribute towards unnatural wall shear stress. High porosity reduces graft compliance by causing fibrovascular infiltration, whereas low porosity discourages the development of an endothelial lining and hence effective antithrombogenicity. Therefore, consideration of mechanical properties is necessary in graft development.

We show that the consideration of correlation effects as implemented in the local spin density approximation+ U approach is crucial for a correct description of the space group symmetry. This implies that the correlation-driven orbital ordering has a strong influence on the structural transitions in this system. Inclusion of spin-orbit effects does not seem to influence the orbital ordering pattern. We further find that the proposed orbital arrangement favors a noncollinear magnetic ordering of V spins, as observed experimentally.

A key strategy being adopted for achieving these goals is the use of an asset-based approach to service delivery, where standard reusable components developed by domain experts are minimally modified for each customer instead of creating custom solutions. One example of this approach is the use of contract templates, one for each type of service offered. A compliance checking system that measures how well actual contracts adhere to standard templates is critical for ensuring the success of such an approach.

The measurement is performed using jets with p T jet> 60 GeV/c and D 0 mesons with p T D> 4 GeV/c in lead-lead (Pb-Pb) and proton-proton (p p) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of s NN= 5.02 TeV, recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The radial distribution of D 0 mesons with respect to the jet axis is sensitive to the production mechanisms of the meson, as well as to the energy loss and diffusion processes undergone by its parent parton inside the strongly interacting medium produced in Pb-Pb collisions. When compared to Monte Carlo event generators, the radial distribution in p p collisions is found to be well described by pythia, while the slope of the distribution predicted by sherpa is steeper than that of the data.

{"title": "Degree of brain connectivity predicts eye-tracking variability\n", "abstract": " Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is commonly associated with diffuse axonal injury (DAI), as well as performance variability and attention and working memory deficits. A visual tracking task with concurrent working memory loading may induce differential effects on performance variability among mTBI patients with varying degrees of DAI and therefore different degrees of brain connectivity. Using a multi-linear regression technique, we examined correlations between white matter integrity as detected by magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging and eye tracking variability under a working memory load in mTBI patients. The impact of increased working memory load on tracking variability was correlated with the degree of white matter integrity. Our results suggest that eye tracking variability under working memory loading may be used to assess the degree of DAI in mTBI patients.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["6"]}

The hadron calorimeters of the CMS experiment are sampling calorimeters of brass and scintillator, and are in the form of one central detector and two endcaps.

An outer calorimeter, outside the magnet coil, covers  1.26, and a steel and quartz-fiber Cherenkov forward calorimeter extends the coverage to  5.19. The initial calibration of the calorimeters was based on results from test beams, augmented with the use of radioactive sources and lasers. The calibration was improved substantially using proton-proton collision data collected at  7, 8, and 13 TeV, as well as cosmic ray muon data collected during the periods when the LHC beams were not present. The present calibration is performed using the early 13 TeV data collected during 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb. The intercalibration of channels exploits the approximate uniformity of energy deposit over the azimuthal angle. The absolute energy scale of the central and endcap calorimeters is set using isolated charged hadrons. The energy scale for the electromagnetic portion of the forward calorimeters is set using Z  ee data.

Moreover a significant fraction of these resources is expected to be available to CDF before LHC era starts and CDF could benefit from using them. CDF is therefore reorganizing its computing model to be integrated with the new GRID model. LcgCAF builds upon the gLite Middleware in order to establish a standard CDF environment transparent to the end-users. LcgCAF is a suite of software entities that handle authentication/security, job submission and monitoring and data handling tasks. CDF authentication and security are entirely based on the Kerberos 5 system, so we needed to develop a kerberos certificate renewing service based on GSI certificates, to guarantee job output transfer to CDF disk servers. An enqueuing and status monitoring functionality was introduced to make the CAF submission latencies independent of the gLite Work Load Management System ones. The CDF batch monitoring is presently based on information from the GridIce monitoring and the LCG Logging and Bookkeeping systems.

CDF has been running a set of CDF Analysis Farms (CAFs), dedicated pools of commodity nodes managed as Condor pools with a small CDF specific software layer on top of it. We have extended this model by using the Condor glide-in mechanism that can create dynamic Condor pools on top of existing batch systems, without installing any additional software. A GlideCAF is essentially a standard CAF with the addition of the tools needed to keep the dynamic pool alive. All the monitoring tools supported on the dedicated CAFs, including semi-interactive access to the running jobs and detailed monitoring, have been preserved. In this paper, we present the salient features and implementation detail of glide-in based Condor pools.

Predictions of permeability alteration can be made before starting a project, and also, the altered permeability can be stated after the process.

{"title": "The impact of peculiar velocities on supernova cosmology\n", "abstract": " We study correlated fluctuations of Type~Ia supernova observables due to peculiar velocities of both the observer and the supernova host galaxies, and their impact on cosmological parameter estimation. We demonstrate using the CosmicFlows-3 dataset that at low redshifts the corrections for peculiar velocities in the JLA catalogue have been systematically underestimated. By querying a horizon-size N-body simulation we find that compared to a randomly placed observer, an observer in an environment like our local Universe will see 2-8 times stronger correlations between supernovae in the JLA catalogue. Hence the covariances usually employed assuming a typical observer are unphysical and underestimate the effects of coherent motion of the supernova host galaxies. Contrary to previous studies which asserted that this should have negligible effect on cosmological parameter estimation, we find that when peculiar velocities are treated consistently the JLA data favours significantly smaller values of the dark energy density than in the standard CDM model. A joint fit to simultaneously determine the cosmological parameters and the bulk flow indicates that the latter is around 250 km/s even beyond 200 Mpc. The local bulk flow is thus an essential nuisance parameter which must be included in cosmological model fitting when analysing supernova data.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["6"]}

The Higgs boson decays are reconstructed with techniques that identify final state quarks as substructure within boosted jets. The data are consistent with standard model expectations. Exclusion limits are placed on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for generic spin-0 and spin-2 massive resonances. The results are interpreted in the context of radion and bulk graviton production in models with a warped extra spatial dimension. These are the best results to date from searches for an HH resonance decaying to this final state, and they are comparable to the results from searches in other channels for resonances with masses below 1.5 TeV.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["6"]}

It has been shown, how the variation of length of the slot embedded in the ground plane results in shifting of resonant frequency. The antenna mentioned in this paper operates at two resonant frequencies. By modifying the length of the embedded slot, the ratio of the higher resonant frequency to the lower frequency can be varied from 2.03 to 1. In actual case it has been found that one of the resonant frequency remains fixed irrespective of the slot length. If the ratio of this fixed frequency to the tunable resonant frequency is considered, then the ratio can be varied from 2.03 to 0.7 by varying the slot length.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["6"]}

In this paper, we address issues related to the use of an asset-based approach for authoring service contracts, where standard templates are defined for each type of service offered. The success of such an approach relies on a compliance checking system. We focus on three key components of such a system. The first measures how well actual contracts comply with the standard templates. The second analyzes compliant contracts containing moderate deviations and reports on the consistent patterns of deviations observed for each template to help identify necessary modifications required in templates to keep them up-to-date with evolving business requirements and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["6"]}

{"title": "Diffusion tensor imaging measures of white matter integrity dissociate damage to memory versus attention networks in mild traumatic brain injury\n", "abstract": " Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) most commonly causes nonspecific axonal disruption and shearing of large nerve fibers, termed diffuse axonal injury (DAI), in over 1.5 million cases reported annually in the United States1. While MRI is generally accepted as the neuroradiological test of choice for the diagnosis of head trauma over CT, both CT and MRI underestimate the severity of damage following a TBI2, 3. This results in mild TBI subjects often having undiagnosed physical injuries that may be associated with known cognitive and psychological dysfunction, most commonly attention and/or short term memory deficits. In order to effectively assess damage following a TBI, one needs to probe the microstructural white matter changes as a result of the injury. One available technique is magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) which uses the characteristics of water diffusion in the brain to assess the integrity of white matter pathways. In the current study, we use DTI to evaluate the extent of DAI due to closed head injury which may account for transient pathologic conditions and, as shown in this study, residual cognitive deficits that persist in the chronic phase.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["6"]}
