{"title": "The effect of investor bias and gender on portfolio performance and risk\n", "abstract": " We survey 84 finance and accounting majors to determine the behavioral factors that males and females exhibit when making investment decisions. The survey results are linked to student performance in the Stock-Trak Global Portfolio Trading Simulation. We find that males and females exhibit different behavioral biases and these behavioral biases can ultimately affect investment performance. We also find evidence to support previous research showing that males are more risk tolerant than females. However, our findings indicate that this behavior may be due to a difference in the perception of the actual risk being taken rather than an inherent desire to engage in more risky behavior.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1949"]}

We argue that this inconsistency may be due to the modeling of information and system quality and the importance of the system usage context. We extend Wixom and Todd\u2019s (2005) integrated model of IS satisfaction by proposing and modeling information and system quality as second-order constructs and by testing the model in the system administration context. Our findings provide support for modeling information and system quality as second-order constructs in the integrated model. Furthermore, our findings support using additional constructs, unique to the context studied, in the integrated model. We contribute to current literature by 1) enhancing the construct validity of information and system quality, which ultimately improves statistical conclusion validity and internal validity for studies that focus on information and system quality; and 2) testing the extended model in the system administration context. Our findings suggest that future research should measure information quality and system quality as second-order constructs and that including context-specific information and system characteristics provides researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of IS characteristics important in system administration.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1949"]}

{"title": "The role of continuous delivery in IT and organizational performance\n", "abstract": " This study investigates the impacts of continuous delivery practices in organizations. Continuous delivery is a set of practices designed to optimize the process of taking changes from version control to production or release to manufacturing. Key elements include comprehensive use of version control, automation of the test and deployment process, and the application of continuous integration to rapidly validate the correctness of every change through running the automated build and test process. When viewed through the lens of organizational capabilities theory, CD is an inside-out spanning process. We propose that the use of CD in organizations affects factors that impact the tech workforce today (eg, perceived burnout and deployment pain), and software delivery performance (eg, change fail rates and IT performance). We also propose that it indirectly influences organizational performance through IT performance (which is itself a spanning process).

Using Demographics in EDM Research.\n", "abstract": " The growing use of machine learning for the data-driven study of social issues and the implementation of data-driven decision processes has required researchers to re-examine the often implicit assumption that datadriven models are neutral and free of biases. The careful examination of machine-learned models has identified examples of how existing biases can inadvertently be perpetuated in fields such as criminal justice, where failing to account for racial prejudices in the prediction of recidivism can perpetuate or exasperate them, and natural language processing, where algorithms trained on human languages corpora have been shown to reproduce strong biases in gendered descriptions. These examples highlight the importance of thinking about how biases might impact the study of educational data and how data-driven models used in educational contexts may perpetuate inequalities. To understand this question, we ask whether and how demographic information, including age, educational level, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and geographical location, is used in Educational Data Mining (EDM) research.

We propose that intelligence use of BI (diagnostic use and an inside-out capability) provides internal benefits, whereas benchmarking use of BI,(interactive use and an outside-in capability) provides competitive benefits. We propose that BI integration with other technologies, a spanning capability, contributes to both internal and competitive benefits.

It is axiomatic that integrity is crucial to accountants that use and audit such systems because no one would use or rely on a suspect accounting system. One of the most interesting types of integrity concerns is adherence to business rules; those standard operating procedures and policies that dictate how an organization conducts transactions in its business environment. While such rules can be enforced in programs that use the database, if the business rules are implemented within the database, they need not be recreated when new applications are developed but will be automatically enforced for all applications. This practice is ever more widely adopted both because it saves programmers' wages and because it inherently increases the overall integrity of systems adopting it. Two mechanisms for enforcement of business rules at the database level are constraints and triggers. These may be of particular interest and importance to auditors who, given that they are confident of their understanding of the function of such mechanisms, may simply review the triggers and constraints and possibly decide to place greater reliance on the system itself, saving auditor time and increasing the quality of the audit.
