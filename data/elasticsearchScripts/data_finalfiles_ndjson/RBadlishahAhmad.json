{"title": "Image steganography techniques: an overview\n", "abstract": " Steganography is one of the methods used for the hidden exchange of information and it can be defined as the study of invisible communication that usually deals with the ways of hiding the existence of the communicated message. In this way, if successfully it is achieved, the message does not attract attention from eavesdroppers and attackers. Using steganography, information can be hidden in different embedding mediums, known as carriers. These carriers can be images, audio files, video files, and text files. The focus in this paper is on the use of an image file as a carrier, and hence, the taxonomy of current steganographic techniques for image files has been presented. These techniques are analyzed and discussed not only in terms of their ability to hide information in image files but also according to how much information can be hidden, and the robustness to different image processing attacks.", "num_citations": "211\n", "authors": ["848"]}

They are designed for use with deflection routing, and even when using only six switches in a module, a deflection probability of 2.8/spl times/10/sup -7/ is possible with a load of 0.8. The modules may also be used as 2/spl times/1 mergers where a deflection probability of 10/sup -12/ is possible with six switches and a total load of 0.8. The BER performance of the modules is simulated with respect to crosstalk, with even relatively poor switch devices of -18.5 dB isolation yielding a power penalty of less than 1 dB.

With this process, the decision makers can make a particular decision for further development of the real-world problems. Several data clusteringtechniques are used in data mining for finding a specific pattern of data. The K-means method isone of the familiar clustering techniques for clustering large data sets. The K-means clustering method partitions the data set based on the assumption that the number of clusters are fixed. The main problem of this method is that if the number of clusters is to be chosen small then there is a higher probability of adding dissimilar items into the same group. On the other hand, if the number of clusters is chosen to be high, then there is a higher chance of adding similar items in the different groups. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new K-Means clustering algorithm. The proposed method performs data clustering dynamically. The proposed method initially calculates a threshold value as a centroid of K-Means and based on this value the number of clusters are formed. At each iteration of K-Means, if the Euclidian distance between two points is less than or equal to the threshold value, then these two data points will be in the same group. Otherwise, the proposed method will create a new cluster with the dissimilar data point. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the original K-Means method.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["848"]}

Hence, in some cases, single hop transmission (\u2018direct transmission\u2019) is not sufficient to deliver the signals to the destination. Therefore, we propose an emergency-based cooperative communication protocol for WBAN, named Critical Data-based Incremental Cooperative Communication (CD-ICC), based on the IEEE 802.15. 6 CSMA standard but assuming a lognormal shadowing channel model.

In view of the fact that the sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks are typically irreplaceable, this type of network should operate with minimum possible energy in order to improve overall energy efficiency. Therefore, the protocols and algorithms developed for sensor networks must incorporate energy consumption as the highest priority optimization goal. Since the base station in sensor networks is usually a node with high processing power, high storage capacity and the battery used can be rechargeable, the base station can be utilized to collect data from each sensor node in the sensing area by moving closer to the transmitting node.

Wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) are one of the most crucial technologies from within the IoMT evolution of the healthcare system, whereby each patient is monitored by low-powered and lightweight sensors. When the WBSNs are integrated into IoMT networks, they are quite likely to overlap each other; thus, cooperation between WBSN sensors is possible. In this paper, we consider communication between WBSNs and beyond their communication range. Therefore, we propose inter-WBAN cooperation for the IoMT system, which is also known as inter-WBAN cooperation in an IoMT environment (IWC-IoMT). In this paper, first, a proposed architecture for the IoT health-based system is investigated. Then, a mathematical model of the outage probability for the IWC-IoMT is derived. Finally, the energy efficiency of the IWC-IoT is analysed and inspected.

{"title": "Extending wireless sensor network lifetime with base station repositioning\n", "abstract": " In wireless sensor networks, the major source of a sensor node failure is battery exhaustion and replacing this energy source in the field is usually not practical. Therefore, the use of energy efficient infrastructure, such as repositioning the base station in a clustered wireless sensor network, is able to prolong the lifetime of the network and improve the overall network data. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient protocol for the repositioning of mobile base station using particle swarm optimization (PSO) in wireless sensor networks.

Optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) system is considered a promising technique for fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) access networks. The performance of RZ against NRZ is compared through simulation by using the Optisystem software version 7. We used two networks designed as follows: one used a RZ pulse generator and the second used a NRZ pulse generator, and both systems were tested with and without erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). It has been found that the NRZ pulse generator in this system is better than the RZ pulse generator for all simulation results. The conversion used a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer (MZI) wavelength converter.

The protection of such secret information has led to the development of different kinds of techniques in different categories. Of all of these, steganography has the advantage of concealing vital information in an imperceptible manner. An improved steganographic system is presented in this paper, which successfully embeds secret data within the frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) coefficients. Based on selection criteria, certain blocks are selected for the concealment of data. To ensure a full recovery for the hidden message, an embedding map is proposed to indicate the selected embedding blocks. To secure the embedding map, Speed-Up Robust Features (SURF) is used to dynamically define the locations in which the embedding map is concealed. In addition, the embedding map is hidden in the frequency domain as well by modifying the Discreet Wavelet Transformation (DWT) coefficients in a content-based manner. The obtained results show the robustness of the proposed system against Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and JPEG compression attacks. Moreover, the resultant stego-images demonstrate good visual quality in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

Conventional communication links such in wireless communication and satellite communications are already left with the bandwidth constraints to provide high speed data for various new services over the communication network.Optical communications came along taking the attention more than two decades ago because of the huge amount of bandwidth it offers. Optical fiber has then been widely deployed in long haul networks which carry a huge amount of information over long distances. However, to provide high speed data to the increasing broadband populations, the research and development in the optical communications are focused on the techniques for providing bandwidth efficient multiple access formats and protocols (K. Fouli & M. Maier, 2007; I. Glesk et al, 2005). In the optical communication, there are three major multiple accesses, which are the Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA), Wavelength Division Multiple Access (WDMA) and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA). The most popular multiple access technique nowadays is the OCDMA (MS Anuar et al, 2013; T. Eltaif et al, 2009) due to its advantages over WDMA and TDMA.

Burst allocation is one of the performance parameter which influences the mobile WiMAX systems, due to resource wastage in the form of unused and unallocated slots per frame which affects the Base station performance. In this paper, a Sequential Burst Allocation (SBA) algorithm is proposed to overcome frame wastage. The SBA algorithm is based on the idea of sequential allocation of user slots. SBA limits the excessive unused slots, and burst fragmentation when necessary is forced to be used to eliminate unallocated slots between data bursts. Continuous allocation from one frame to the next has a significant impact on reducing resource wastage.

Huge number of users is joining each day to the existing fixed band frequency but the bandwidth is not increasing. These requirements demand for efficient and intelligent use of spectrum. To solve this issue, the Cognitive Radio (CR) is the best choice. Spectrum sensing of a wireless heterogeneous network is a fundamental issue to detect the presence of primary users\u2019 signals in CR networks. In order to protect primary users (PUs) from harmful interference, the spectrum sensing scheme is required to perform well even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments.

It increasingly adopts an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to consume the available spectrum efficiently. To obtain a good performance, such systems need to know the impact of channels to achieve the communication quality. It is a matter of how to extract transmitted data in an efficient way. The system employs pilot symbols to estimate wireless channels. Channel estimation is normally accomplished by conveying known pilot symbols in giving the positions of the frequency-time grid. Traditionally the channel is estimated using a fixed number of equally spaced pilot symbols. Though different environment requires a different set number of pilots. So, if the numbers of pilots are limited, it might not be able to estimate the changes efficiently and may consume part of bandwidth, which in turn reduces spectral efficiency.

This approach not only efficiently enhances resource exploitation in the base station (BS) but also increases the data rate and number of served users. This work considers the downlink sub-frame of WiMAX BS by using the partial usage of sub-channel mode and the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access. Five cases were included as a trade-off study to identify the best way of utilizing BS resources in the FFR technique. Theoretical analysis was conducted to present a new formula for the FFR data rate. Simulation results (cases 5 and 4) reveal that the proposed approach has an advantage over the traditional FFR technique in various metrics. The number of served users and slots utilized was increased by 100% when case 5 was considered. By contrast, the data rate (8, 69 Mbit/s), subcarrier efficiency (2, 02 bit/subcarrier/burst), and spectral efficiency (0,869 bit/s/H) were enhanced when case 4 was considered.

{"title": "Realization of a new code for noise suppression in spectral amplitude coding OCDMA networks\n", "abstract": " Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technique has been widely used in wireless communication networks. CDMA communication system allows multiple users to access the network simultaneously using unique codes. Optical CDMA (OCDMA) has the advantage of using optical processing to perform certain network applications, like addressing and routing without resorting to complicated multiplexers or demultiplexers. The asynchronous data transmission can simplify network management and control. Therefore, OCDMA is an attractive candidate for LAN applications. Among all OCDMA techniques, spectral amplitude coding (SAC) can eliminate first order multiple access interference (MAI) when using balanced detection. In SAC OCDMA the frequency spectrum is partitioned into bins that are present or not according to the spectral code assigned to a particular user. Phase Intensity Induced Noise (PIIN) is known to be the most important source of impairment in SAC OCDMA systems. Codes with ideal cross correlation have been studied for many years. In this chapter, a new code with zero cross correlation property has been constructed and designed for SAC OCDMA system namely Random diagonal (RD) code. The performance of the OCDMA system is degraded as the number of simultaneous users\u00b7 increases, especially when the number of users is large. This is contributed by the MAI effects which arises from the incomplete orthogonal of the used signature codes.

It provides a distributed file system that stores data on the compute nodes. Basically, it represents a master/slave architecture that consists of a NameNode and copious Data Nodes. Data Nodes contain application data and metadata of application data resides in the Main Memory of NameNode. In cached approach, they fragment the metadata depending on the last access time and move the least frequently used data to secondary memory. If the requested data is not found in main memory then the secondary data will be loaded again on the RAM. So when the secondary data reloads to the primary memory then the NameNode main memory limitation arises again. The focus of this research is to reduce the namespace problem of main memory and to make the system dynamically scalable. A new Metadata Fragmentation Algorithm is proposed that separates the metadata list of NameNode dynamically. The NameNode creates Secondary Memory File in perspective of the threshold value and allocates secondary memory location based on the requirement. According to the proposed algorithm the maximum third, out of fourth of main memory is used at the secondary file caching time. The free space aids in faster operation by Dynamically Scalable NameNode approach. This proposed algorithm shows that the space utilization is increased to 17% and time utilization is increased to 0.0005% with the comparison of the existing fragmentation algorithm.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["848"]}

Structured WLAN APs were considered as primary users (PUs) and the smartphones as secondary users (SUs) for this study. At present spectrum saturation problem is a critical issue due to a large number of users join every day to this fix band of network. To support more users in a specific area needs more WLAN access points (APs) to avoid saturation. 2.4 GHZ WLAN only has 13 separate mutual channels, among them only 3 channels are non-overlapped with each other. As a result interference may often occur during the time of transmission. Wi-Fi Direct technology uses the same channels as the WLAN AP to communicate within smartphones (SUs). If the SUs use the same overlapped channel with the nearby APs, it interferes to the PUs and increase bit error rate (BER) for both users.

Different values of these parameters provide different network performance. Sending large packets over wireless networks leads to reduce packet header overhead, but may have adverse impact on the number of lost packets due to collisions or corruptions in a wireless channel which leads to degrade in network performance. Therefore the values of these parameters must be chosen carefully. This paper presents an investigation and analysis of using different packet sizes and different packet rates on the performance of a motorway surveillance system comprised of wireless cameras placed along a roadway. The investigation and analysis were performed under varying network environments and for several different evaluation metrics. It is a conclusion of this study that the small packet size results in better network performance as compared to the larger packet size.

Mobile Ad hoc wireless networks eliminate the constraints of infrastructure and enable devices to create and join networks anytime, anywhere. The lack of infrastructure and nodes mobility in mobile ad hoc networks makes this type of network vulnerable to different types of network attacks. One of the most import types is black hole attack. Black hole attack is the simple but effective type that is based on the insertion of a malicious node having the capacity to take the identity of valid nodes on an ad hoc network. This insertion leads to disturbances in the network and that due to the participation of all the nodes in the routing. Since a malicious node gives false information of having shortest route to the destination node so as to get all data packets and drops it.

{"title": "Corrupted packets discarding mechanism to alleviate congestion in wireless body area network\n", "abstract": " Generation of high traffic from continuous sensing and collection of medical data from various biosensors on multiple body is most likely to occur in the Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). This could be a factor to the congestion in the network. Occurrence of congestion would collapse the performances in the WBAN network in terms of increment in delay, high packets loss, reduction in throughput and packet deliver ratio (PDR). The crucial concerns in WBAN are prevention from the loss of critical data and longer delay in the network as they could result to late delivery of medical treatment and possibility of the increase in mortality. Therefore, this study proposes a mechanism to alleviate the congestion from happening in the first place through discarding the corrupted packets before the beginning of data transmission to the base station. Extensive simulations are done in OMNeT+ to analyze the performance of the proposed mechanism by varying traffic from low to high under different number of nodes and constant Bit Error Rate (BER) and packet size.

Most AMP techniques use buffer fullness or its variation as indicator to adapt to playout rate. Nonetheless, selecting a convenient buffer threshold of particular design is a great challenge. Based on this principle, Dynamic Fuzzy Logic (DFL) controls principle fused with AMP technique to propose a new technique, known as DFLAMP. The technique is implemented to reduce playout delay and prevent buffer outage. Moreover, DFLAMP is also utilized to adjust playout rate based on arrival rate variation and adapt playout rate to keep the buffer fullness around the desired level. Simulation results have indicated that DFLAMP technique efficiently outperforms other AMP approaches.

The new SRA FFR efficiently tackled the wastage of resources and bandwidth in traditional FFR. The work aimed to enhance the resource exploitation in the downlink subframe of WiMAX BS by using Partial Usage of Sub-channel (PUSC) mode and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA). Four cases were designed modeled as a trade-off study to specify the best way of exploiting BS resources in traditional FFR technique. Quantitative measurements (Case 1 and Case 3) illustrated that the SRA FFR model had an advantage over traditional FFR technique in various metrics, where the study concluded with two optimal solutions: The number of served users and slots utilization are reached to 87.77% and 85.89% respectively of the full DL subframe capacity when Case 3 is considered. In contrast, the data rate (8.611 Mbps), subcarrier efficiency (3.210 b/subcarrier/burst), and spectral efficiency (1.395 bps) were improved more when Case 1 was applied. The spectral efficiency increased more than twice in SRA FFR that due to exploitation all the available BW in DL subframe. The new SRA FFR succeeded in solving the problems related to user\u2019s rejection as a result of a lack of resources and inefficient use of the bandwidth in cellular network.

{"title": "Monitoring Growth of Maize in Two different Irradiance Levels via Induced-Fluorescence Emission from Intact Leaves\n", "abstract": " Prediction of the optimum growth of maize (Zea mays ssp. mays L.) as monitored by light induced fluorescence was recorded from intact leaves. Two sets of maize plants were grown for the purpose of this study. The first set was grown in normal conditions under sunlight exposure; the second set was environmentally stressed by growth under shaded conditions. Growth and development were monitored for the period between early foliage leaves formation to flowering and fruiting of plants. Monochromatic blue light of 450 nm was used as an excitation source to induce the chlorophyll fluorescence emission at 685 nm and 733 nm. The peak intensity ratio (PIR) at 685 nm and 733 nm ie (IF685/IF733), and the area ratio (AR) were used for monitoring the growth and development of maize, from seed germination until flowering and fruiting. The results revealed that the normal conditions gave a faster seed germination rate and the best growth and development of maize, while the stressing shaded conditions expressed in delayed seed germination, poor growth that led to failure of flowering and immaturity. PIR and AR for the normal conditions were found to follow linear relationships. For the second environmentally stressed plants linearity was clearly violated for both PIR and AR The line slopes of the PIR and AR were 1.30 and 0.68 and the intercepts were 1.30 and 0.04 respectively. Hence, we conclude that linearity of the growth factor as a function of time is a good indicator for the optimum growth of maize.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["848"]}

{"title": "Dynamical decoupling using NMR for quantum computing\n", "abstract": " Quantum computers can execute certain tasks more efficiently than classical computers by processing information in a system governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The basic unit of quantum computation is a qubit. A qubit is typically a microscopic system such as an atom or spin or photon [1]. A quantum mechanical two-level system (like a spin-1/2) can be used as a computational basis by identifying their eigenstates with these values, eg| 0\u232a for spin up and| 1\u232a for spin down. One of the main advantages of quantum computers in contrast to classical computers is\" quantum parallelism\". Quantum parallelism is based on the superposition principle in quantum mechanics. The number of basis states for N qubit system is 2N. Unlike in classical computers these states are established in superposition states. The number of parallel function evaluations grows exponentially with the number of qubits in quantum computers, whereas it increases linearly with the number of input bits in classical computers. This powerful computation algorithm, implemented in a quantum computer, makes it possible to solve problems which are hard or impossible for classical computers such as the factorization of large numbers Preskill [2], Vandersypen et al.[3], DiVincenzo [4].Simulating quantum systems in a classical computers is awkward because the required resources grow exponentially with the system size (eg superposition states do not exist in classical computers).

The Modified AODV (MAODV) is different from the original AODV protocol in that it modifies the original AODV to reduce the length of the path of routing messages (RERR and RREQ) when link breakage occurs. In the new protocol, one of the cameras (stationary nodes) which belong to the old route is pushed to start the process of rediscovering a new path to the unreachable destination instead of the source node.

Generally, Data Acquisition Systems (DAS) are used to electronically monitor or gather data from the external physical environment (Ng, 1994). DAS normally consists of three elements: acquisition hardware, input and storage/display unit. The acquisition hardware plays a vital role in influencing the performance of DAS. Most of the previous research has used Personal Computer (PC) as the acquisition hardware. The trend was then changed from standard PC to high speed PC to provide better performance in terms of data processing and data transferring. The embedded processor board has become a new alternative platform for DAS application. Several embedded processor board used as acquisition hardware are microcontroller, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and Single Board Computer (SBC). The microcontroller is the most popular platform for small and simple application because of its low cost. Some developments use FPGA as Data Acquisition Unit (DAU). FPGA allows modification of internal logic circuitry without touching hardware component. The DSP board is mostly used in applications that handle real-time computation process.

A single cure for cancer has proved elusive since there is not a single type of cancer but as many as 100 different types of cancer. In addition, there are very few demonstrable biochemical differences between cancerous cells and normal cells. For this reason the effectiveness of many anticancer drugs is limited by their toxicity to normal rapidly growing cells.

{"title": "A Design of Dual Band Sierpinski Carpet Fractal Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) for GSM 1800/1900, UMTS and HiperLAN Application\n", "abstract": " The Planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) is currently in use as an embedded antenna in many radiotelephone handsets [1-8]. It is one of the most promising antenna types because it is small and has a low profile, making it suitable for mounting on portable equipments. The planar inverted-F antenna which is a type of microstrip antenna shows much promise in dealing with the shortfalls of the \u03bb/4 monopole antenna in mobile communication applications [9]. The planar inverted-F antenna also has exhibited a reasonably high gain and possesses a bandwidth that is broad enough for mobile operation.[10-14]. However, PIFA have some drawbacks such as low efficiency, narrow bandwidth and inability to have a multi-band resonance. To enhance these shortcomings, especially narrow bandwidth, while meeting the miniaturization requirements of mobile devices, Fractal PIFA has been proposed, designed and presented in this work.Fractal PIFAs can be used as an internal antenna solution and to produce a wideband frequency range [15-18]. The proposed designs are able to provide coverage at all desired frequency bands ie GSM 1800/1900, Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) and High Performance Wireless Local Area Network (HiperLAN) application. In order to obtain a good fundamental antenna design, the initial studies were carried out theoretically, using CST Microwave Studio software.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["848"]}

{"title": "Yemen; Exchange Rate Policy in the Face of Dwindling Oil Exports\n", "abstract": " This paper investigates the likely implications of declining oil production on Yemen's equilibrium exchange rate, and discusses policy options to ensure a smooth transition to a nonoil economy. The empirical results suggest that, as oil production and foreign exchange earnings fall, the Yemeni rial will have to adjust downward in real effective terms to keep pace with the equilibrium exchange rate. In light of strong pass-through from exchange rate depreciation to domestic inflation, this could entail a substantial depreciation in nominal terms. Given the nature of the adjustment, a floating exchange rate regime appears to be the best option, if supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies. However, given public fixation on a exchange rate stability, a softly managed float would be a better option for Yemen whereby the central bank may have to lead the market toward the equilibrium exchange rate.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["848"]}

Results showed that nitrogen application significantly increased flag leaf area, plant height in both elevations. As for yield and yield components, a positive increase in grain yield was obtained as a result of nitrogen application. The pattern of response of spikelets per spike, seeds per spike, number of spikes per m2 was similar to that of grain yield. Nitrogen fertilizer, generally, decreased the 1000-seed weight and harvest index. Nitrogen percentage of plants at 50% anthesis and grain nitrogen percentage increased gradually with increasing nitrogen levels. Generally, the crop at high elevation site, gave greater biomass yield, grain yield and yield components. El Nelein variety was the earliest to flower and mature and produced higher grain and biomass yields with increased N levels. The local variety Donki was the latest to flower and mature, and gave the lowest yield and yield components.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["848"]}

{"title": "Effect of soil compaction on root, shoot development of wheat cultivars at three growth stages\n", "abstract": " Soil compaction is a serious problem because the altered soil physical properties can adversely affect plant growth. Soil compaction was examined in a pot experiment for its effect on wheat varieties at three growth stages at NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar, during Rabi 1989-90. Ten wheat varieties were subjected to two compaction treatment;(1) Control-no compaction and (2) Compacted 874 joules energy. The soil was compacted by dropping a 11.5 kg weight from a height of 65 cm onto a piece of woodcut to fit the inside diameter of the pot. Root shoot growth were affected by compaction with response differing by wheat varieties. Soil compaction reduce root growth but this affect was significant only at later growth stage (90 days after sowing). Shoot growth was negatively affected and the affect was significantly apparent at all growth stages. Total biomass was significantly affected at growth stage of 60 and 90 days after sowing. Varieties Barani-70, Sarhad-82 and Chakwal-86 were least affected by compaction while the adverse affect of compaction was apparent in Pirsabak-85, Yecora-70 and Pak-81.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["848"]}

Such poor stands have frequently been attributed to unfavourable environmental conditions. Extensive studies have been shown that seed borne and soil inhibiting fungi, combined with unfavourable environmental conditions are largely responsible for their poor germination and emergence. PAMMEL et al.(1916) have described a disease of sorghum caused by Fusarium. They have, however, not stated that it causes seedling blight. VALLEAU (1920) later demonstrated that F. monili/orme is internally borne in corn seeds and he also demonstrated damping off in sorghum seedling by this pathogen under humid conditions.

{"title": "Burst Fragmentation Model Based on Sequential Burst Allocation Algorithm for Mobile WiMAX\n", "abstract": " the downlink Bandwidth resources of WiMAX are allocated by the burst allocation algorithm. The algorithm is responsible for calculating the appropriate location of a number of the smallest unit of bandwidth which is called the slot for all users within the downlink subframe in the form of bursts. Resource wastage in the form of unused and unallocated slots is a real common problem accompanies resource management in the burst allocation algorithms. This paper investigates the Sequential Burst Allocation (SBA) that based on sequential slot allocation and burst fragmentation. An analytical model of frame utilization has been derived. Moreover, this paper presents criteria of burst fragmentation and investigates the effect of burst fragmentation to the allocation efficiency. It has been observed from the results that the SBA algorithm outperforms the Standard (ST) algorithm in term of number of users and resource wastage reduction per frame. The research results illustrates that burst fragmentation can enhance the proportion of frame utilization with minor effect to the overhead size. As well as, the results are useful to be a heuristic guide line for MAC layer scheduler to decide the best burst size that can be used.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["848"]}
