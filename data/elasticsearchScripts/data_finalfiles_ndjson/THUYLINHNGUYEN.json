{"title": "The Legionella IcmSW Complex Directly Interacts with DotL to Mediate Translocation of Adaptor-Dependent Substrates\n", "abstract": " Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium that replicates within human alveolar macrophages by evasion of the host endocytic pathway through the formation of a replicative vacuole. Generation of this vacuole is dependent upon the secretion of over 275 effector proteins into the host cell via the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4SS). The type IV coupling protein (T4CP) subcomplex, consisting of DotL, DotM, DotN, IcmS and IcmW, was recently defined. DotL is proposed to be the T4CP of the L. pneumophila T4SS based on its homology to known T4CPs, which function as inner-membrane receptors for substrates. As a result, DotL is hypothesized to play an integral role(s) in the L. pneumophila T4SS for the engagement and translocation of substrates. To elucidate this role, a genetic approach was taken to screen for dotL mutants that were unable to survive inside host cells. One mutant, dotLY725Stop, did not interact with the type IV adaptor proteins IcmS/IcmW (IcmSW) leading to the identification of an IcmSW-binding domain on DotL. Interestingly, the dotLY725Stop mutant was competent for export of one class of secreted effectors, the IcmSW-independent substrates, but exhibited a specific defect in secretion of IcmSW-dependent substrates. This differential secretion illustrates that DotL requires a direct interaction with the type IV adaptor proteins for the secretion of a major class of substrates. Thus, by identifying a new target for IcmSW, we have discovered that the type IV adaptors perform an additional role in the export of substrates by the L. pneumophila Dot/Icm T4SS.", "num_citations": "57\n", "authors": ["126"]}

{"title": "Mismatched and wobble base pairs govern primary microRNA processing by human Microprocessor\n", "abstract": " MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate gene expression. miRNAs are produced from primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), which are cleaved by Microprocessor. Microprocessor, therefore, plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and precision of miRNA production, and thus the function of the final miRNA product. Here, we conducted high-throughput enzymatic assays to investigate the catalytic mechanism of Microprocessor cleaving randomized pri-miRNAs. We identified multiple mismatches and wobble base pairs in the upper stem of pri-miRNAs, which influence the efficiency and accuracy of their processing. The existence of these RNA elements helps to explain the alternative cleavage of Microprocessor for some human pri-miRNAs. We also demonstrated that miRNA biogenesis can be altered via modification of the RNA elements by RNA-editing events or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["126"]}
{"title": "The internal loops in the lower stem of primary microRNA transcripts facilitate single cleavage of human Microprocessor\n", "abstract": " The human Microprocessor complex cleaves primary microRNA (miRNA) transcripts (pri-miRNAs) to initiate miRNA synthesis. Microprocessor consists of DROSHA (an RNase III enzyme), and DGCR8. DROSHA contains two RNase III domains, RIIIDa and RIIIDb, which simultaneously cleave the 3p- and 5p-strands of pri-miRNAs, respectively. In this study, we show that the internal loop located in the lower stem of numerous pri-miRNAs selectively inhibits the cleavage of Microprocessor on their 3p-strand, thereby, facilitating the single cleavage on their 5p-strand. This single cleavage does not lead to the production of miRNA but instead, it downregulates miRNA expression. We also demonstrate that by manipulating the size of the internal loop in the lower stem of pri-miRNAs, we can alter the ratio of single-cut to double-cut products resulted from the catalysis of Microprocessor, thus changing miRNA\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["126"]}

Armed with the language and expertise of modernmedicine, French physicians and administrators set out on a mission to relocate Vietnamese childbirth to a clinical setting.

Thwarted by local resistance, cultural misunderstanding, and ambiguous policy, the Western model of hospital birth neither displaced nor transformedindigenous birthing traditions in the ways the French had envisioned. Instead, as author Thuy Linh Nguyen demonstrates, the emergence of a plural system of maternity services, many of which were based on local practices and beliefs, served as a testimony to the compromises and adaptations made by both the French and Vietnamese populations.

Natural products have historically been a rich source of both antibiotics and lead compounds for new antibacterial agents. The natural product simocyclinone D8 (SD8) has been reported to inhibit DNA gyrase, a validated antibacterial drug target, by a unique catalytic inhibition mechanism of action. In this work, we have used a deconstruction-reconstruction approach to prepare analogs of the coumarin subunit of SD8 and evaluated their ability to disrupt binding of the DNA gyrase enzyme to DNA in a surface plasmon resonance assay.

A cross-coupled rectifier (CCR) with floating sub-circuit structures was utilized in the application of dynamic threshold MOSFET (DTMOS) on Silicon on Thin Buried Oxide (SOTB) to obtain high drain conductance of the MOSFET. A wide bandwidth matching between antenna and rectifier was designed to receive energy from the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) RF signal with a bandwidth of 15 MHz at 950 MHz band. Realistic measurements with a 950 MHz LTE mobile phone signal from the ambient environment indicate that an average DC output power of 2.77 \u03bc W is harvested with the proposed RFEH system at a level of\u2212 19.4 dBm input power.

This paper describes current access to anti-smoking information among school children aged 13 to 15 years in Vietnam in 2014 and examines its potential impact on preventing smoking initiation. The data used in this paper were obtained from the 2014 Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) in Vietnam. Students were asked questions about their level of awareness of anti-smoking information from various sources in the past 30 days and about lessons in school regarding the dangers of tobacco use during the last 12 months. Those who have never smoked were asked\" whether or not they thought about avoiding cigarettes because of health warnings on cigarette packages\" and answers were analyzed in combination with data on access to anti-smoking information from other sources. The prevalence of exposure to antismoking campaigns was high among school children in Viet Nam: 55.3% of current smokers reported thoughts of smoking cessation because of health warnings on cigarette packages; 60.5% of never smokers avoided initiating smoking because of the same health warnings. The potential impact of graphic health warnings to prevent school-aged children from smoking initiation would be stronger if there was concurrent access to anti-smoking programs on the dangers of tobacco use in schools.

The transgenic plants were assessed with reference to molecular and phenotypic characteristics related to the drought-tolenrance trait. The results proved that the maize plants carrying ZmDrEBtv gene showed enhanced tolerance and better performance to the water-deficit environment at different stages, compared to the wild-type plants.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["126"]}
{"title": "Vietnamese Traditional Medicine: A Social History, by C. Michele Thompson\n", "abstract": " Michele Thompson\u2019s Vietnamese Traditional Medicine provides a fascinating transnational history of Vietnamese medicine through its understanding and preventive treatment of smallpox in the first half of the nineteenth century. In this book, Thompson questions the larger scholarly assumption that Vietnamese medical traditions derived most of its theoretical underpinnings and many of its therapeutic practices from Chinese medicine during and after the nine-hundred-year Chinese occupation of northern Vietnam (p. 13). Using smallpox it as a case study, the book seeks to investigate why Chinese and Vietnamese medical practitioners came up with different conclusions on the same disease. Drawing from medical texts written in both Chinese and the Vietnamese N\u00f4m script as well as French colonial records, Thompson walks the readers through the history of smallpox as an epidemic in both Vietnam and China\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["126"]}

{"title": "A study on CDIO-based STEAM program design and implementation\n", "abstract": " STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) education has gained popularity in schools, colleges, universities across the United States, Europe, parts of Asia, recently raised in Vietnam. Despite its attraction and preparation for the 21st-century skills, little empirical research and good implementation exists to guide the STEAM program design process as well as effective instructional practices, and even less is known about the challenges associated with individual assessment aiming to expected learning outcomes of the modules developed in the STEAM program. This paper will present a study on the design process and implementation of a CDIO-based STEAM program. In which, the CDIO framework, standards and syllabus are embedded and aligned with the STEAM program in two aspects: in most of the stages of the continuous improvement process of program development and implementation, and in lesson syllabus structure. The research concludes with implications for educational researchers and educators to consider that it is very potential to apply CDIO principles for an integrated curriculum with a project-based method for STEAM education, especially with the CDIO-based STEAM syllabus. The initial satisfaction survey which was taken on more than a hundred students has been carried out and obtained a high score of satisfaction, revealing the suitability in both curriculum and teaching-learning activity design. The CDIO-based maker space reflects its superior advantages of supporting innovative learning environments. Therefore, good practices on CDIO implementation are recommended for further discussion\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["126"]}
