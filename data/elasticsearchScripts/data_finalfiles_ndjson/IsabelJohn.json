{"title": "Conducting on-line surveys in software engineering\n", "abstract": " One purpose of empirical software engineering is to enable an understanding of factors that influence software development. Surveys are an appropriate empirical strategy to gather data from a large population (e.g., about methods, tools, developers, companies) and to achieve an understanding of that population. Although surveys are quite often performed, for example, in social sciences and marketing research, they are underrepresented in empirical software engineering research, which most often uses controlled experiments and case studies. Consequently, also the methodological support how to perform such studies in software engineering is rather low. However, with the increasing pervasion of the Internet it is possible to perform surveys easily and cost-effectively over Internet pages (i.e., on-line), while at the same time the interest in performing surveys is growing. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "218\n", "authors": ["1532"]}

So it's time to look at what has been done in scoping in the last years and what is still to be done.

{"title": "Definition of reference architectures based on existing systems\n", "abstract": " Migration from single system development to product family engineering is a challenging task. The success of a product family depends greatly on the quality of its reference architecture, one of the central artifacts in product family engineering. Therefore, it is important to leverage the experience embodied in successful, existing systems coming from the same domains or from the same development organization in order to achieve high-quality reference architectures.Despite the importance of leveraging existing knowledge, the literature provides limited guidance on how to mine prior, related systems for this specific purpose. This report addresses this issue by introducing the PuLSE\u2122-DSSA1 approach that explicitly takes information from existing systems into account and gives guidance for migrating it into a product family. PuLSE\u2122-DSSA is a method that combines forward engineering design activities together with reverse engineering tasks.", "num_citations": "55\n", "authors": ["1532"]}

The results of the assessment showed that the incremental introduction of architecture-centric product line development can be considered successful even though there is no quantifiable reduction of time-to-market as well as development and maintenance costs so far. The success is mainly shown by the ability of Testo to develop more complex products and the satisfaction of the involved developers.

Although the basic idea of product lines is simple, systematic implementation of the approach is a challenging task. In fact, today's software product lines have such complex variability that their handling must be supported by tools, otherwise a systematic approach would not be possible. The same holds for requirements management of product lines. On the basis of specific industrial scenarios the paper derives important requirements that have to be observed if requirements management tools are to be usefully applied to product lines. Current requirements management tools are evaluated on the basis of these requirements in their daily industrial use.

We describe experience with an approach towards domain analysis that tries to overcome this general problem by systematically coordinating domain analysis effort and necessary product (family) evolution activities.

This is of particular importance in regions where rapid and frequently unregulated urban development as well as short-term changes in demography and migration patterns have led to a dramatic increase of urban area and population such as in the greater Tirana region, Albania. Several modelling techniques have been developed within recent years such as cellular automata, agent-based, system dynamics, neural networks, and logistic regressions (Verburg et al. 2006; Lakes et al. 2009). Among these approaches machine learning techniques seem promising particularly in studies with little knowledge about the land use change process under investigation and data problems regarding quality, availability and comparability. Support vector machines (SVM) are a supervised learning approach for classification or regression of a multidimensional feature space and have been successfully applied for classification of remote sensing data (van der Linden et al. 2008; Burges 1998).
