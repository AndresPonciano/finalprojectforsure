{"title": "Data assimilation as a problem in optimal tracking: Application of Pontryagin\u2019s minimum principle to atmospheric science\n", "abstract": " A data assimilation strategy based on feedback control has been developed for the geophysical sciences\u2014a strategy that uses model output to control the behavior of the dynamical system. Whereas optimal tracking through feedback control had its early history in application to vehicle trajectories in space science, the methodology has been adapted to geophysical dynamics by forcing the trajectory of a deterministic model to follow observations in accord with observation accuracy. Fundamentally, this offline (where it is assumed that the observations in a given assimilation window are all given) approach is based on Pontryagin\u2019s minimum principle (PMP) where a least squares fit of idealized path to dynamic law follows from Hamiltonian mechanics. This utilitarian process optimally determines a forcing function that depends on the state (the feedback component) and the observations. It follows that this optimal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1679"]}
{"title": "Advanced Wellbore Stability Analysis for Drilling Naturally Fractured Rocks\n", "abstract": " An advanced wellbore stability analysis software product has been developed in-house at Aramco. This product offers three analysis modules:(1) the classical mechanical module (elastic);(2) the time-dependent analysis module (poroelasticity); and (3) the time-dependent analysis of naturally fractured rock module (dual-porosity and dual permeability poroelasticity). The stress and pressure analyses are integrated with four rock failure criteria (Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Modified Lade, and Hoek-Brown) to calculate critical mud densities. The basic mechanical module is similar to the wellbore stability module provided in the most-frequently-used drilling geomechanics software. What sets this product apart from the others is that no commercial drilling software to date has the time-dependent stress and pressure analyses modeled by this product's poroelastic and dual-porosity poroelastic modules, which can\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1679"]}
{"title": "Application of Artificial Intelligence to Predict Time-Dependent Safe Mud Weight Windows for Inclined Wellbores\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an artificial intelligence (AI) solution for predicting time-dependent safe mud weight windows and polar charts for inclined wellbores. The AI agents, in the form of neural networks, are trained and tested on data generated from a poroelastic analytical solution. The results show that the trained neural networks are capable of predicting time-dependent mud weight windows and polar charts as accurately as the analytical solution. The AI solution achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.107 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.995 for collapse mud weights, and an MSE of 0.043 and an R2 of 0.998 for fracturing mud weights on test datasets. They are also significantly faster and less demanding in computing capacity than the analytical solution, consistently showing three-orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in computational speed tests. Evaluations on two case studies similarly demonstrate the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1679"]}
{"title": "Data assimilation in the ecosystem carbon pool model using the forward sensitivity method\n", "abstract": " The forward sensitivity method (FSM) is applied to assimilate observation data into the ecosystem carbon pool model. The goal is to find the corrections to the control vector (initial condition and parameters) of the model to reduce the errors between the model forecast and observed data. In this work, we solve the model equation for exact solution, analyze the sensitivity of the model output to the control vector and conduct FSM experiments. The results show encouraging improvements in the forecasting power of the model after the control vector is corrected.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1679"]}
