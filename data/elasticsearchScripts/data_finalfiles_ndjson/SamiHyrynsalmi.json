{"title": "Agile methods for embedded systems development-a literature review and a mapping study\n", "abstract": " There is a wide area of applications that use embedded systems, and the number of such systems keeps growing. The required functionality and complexity of embedded systems are also constantly increasing, and development of such products is becoming increasingly harder. This requires new thinking on the product development processes, and one such emerging philosophy is the agile methods. These methods were created by the software engineering community where they are commonly used. Since then, they have been adopted in embedded systems development; however, whether they can improve the embedded systems product development processes remains an open question. This study aims to bring forth what is known about agile methods in embedded systems development and to find out if agile practices are suitable in this domain and what evidence is there to support the findings. We conducted a literature review and a mapping study to answer these questions. The scope of this study is not only limited to embedded software development, but also to embedded hardware and integrated circuits. We have found that agile methods can be used in the embedded domain, but the methods and practices need to be adapted to suit the more constrained field of embedded product development. Furthermore, the field of embedded product development has wide diversity of products with different needs and domain-specific problems so that no single method is applicable, but rather many methods and practices are needed for different situations.", "num_citations": "64\n", "authors": ["747"]}

Previous studies on gamification have mainly taken a positive approach towards the phenomenon and its implications. To depart from the existing research, this tertiary literature review assesses the negative effects of gamification (such as game addiction and ethical issues). The systematic literature review method is followed in collection of 22 literature studies published on gamification. The analysis of these secondary studies show that while several researchers acknowledge possible problems and consequences, there is a clear research gap in understanding the negative impacts of gamification. We categorize the presented negative implications to limiting and harmful issues. Finally, this study calls for further work assessing and defining the limitations and borders for the ethical use of game design elements in everyday life as well as for growing our understanding for harmful issues.", "num_citations": "50\n", "authors": ["747"]}

The software industry is a challenging one for survey research due to the pervasive nature of software; Software is a key component of many modern technology products, and can be also used as an integrated element when producing services. Moreover, it is difficult to separate the software industry from other information product industries [101]. The recent boom in online services has further increased the challenges in defining the boundaries of the industry [72]. The main focus of this report is on the software product business, but non-product or service businesses are covered to some extent as well.Software industry is a subset of professional software development. We classify these activities into four categories as shown in Figure 1.1. Software business is traditionally divided into software products and custom made software [79]. This classification is reflected on the horizontal axis of our classification. Recently the boundaries between software industry and other industries have become increasingly blurred due to two trends. First, hardware producers are relying on software on functionality and differentiation. In some cases firms considered traditionally to be solely device or machinery vendors have expanded their business to include also complementary software products or services that have a significant software component. Second, the emergence of online services and e-business has resulted in firms operating in other industries, such as media, retailing, and various services, to expand into Internet based offerings.

In this paper, Ulrich Beck's theory of a zombie category is used as an instrument to raise the question whether the general concept of an `ecosystem' is already a zombie category term-a term which has already dead and empty in content, while still being alive and used. `Business ecosystem' and its derivatives such as the `software ecosystem' are terms which do have a proper description; however, due to the widely use in different context, the terms might already be losing their original meaning.This paper reviews 20 highly-cited non-ecological ecosystem papers published after 2010.

{"title": "Healthy until otherwise proven: Some proposals for renewing research of software ecosystem health\n", "abstract": " The software ecosystem has become a central conceptualisation for characterising the contemporary software business world. To understand and evaluate ecosystems, the concept of 'ecosystem health' was borrowed from the field of biology. In a 'healthy' ecosystem, the participants will flourish and, vice versa, suffer in an unhealthy one. Yet, there is a lack of empirical validations for the current approach as well as certain limitations regarding the concept. This paper will present a critique on current ecosystem health measurement and evaluation approaches. In addition, there is discussion on three proposals that could help to refocus the academic research on software ecosystem health.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["747"]}

The \u2018ecosystem health\u2019is a crucial concept in the domain of ecosystem research:\u201cif the ecosystem is healthy, individual participants will thrive; if the ecosystem is unhealthy, individual participants will suffer\u201d. Three health measures have been defined for business ecosystems: productivity, robustness to external shocks, and niche creation that helps the ecosystem to renew. Similarly, the ecosystem health is seen as the indicator of well-being of a software ecosystem. This presentation discusses the current knowledge of software ecosystem health. In summary, we show that the view on what constitutes ecosystem health is scattered and the field needs redefinition\u2013it is argued that the new direction of software ecosystem health should be sought in collaboration with industrial experts.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["747"]}
{"title": "Accounting Testing in Software Cost Estimation: A Case Study of the Current Practice and Impacts\n", "abstract": " Testing has become an integral part of most software projects. It accounts for even as high a share as 40% of the overall work effort. At the same time software projects are systematically exceeding their effort and schedule forecasts. Regardless of the overruns and big share of testing, there is very little advice for estimating testing activities. This case study research assesses the current practice of estimating testing activities, and the impact of these practices on estimation and project success. Based on the interviews with 11 stakeholders involved in two case projects and examination of project documentation, this study shows that companies easily deviate from their standard procedures, when estimating testing. This may even lead to severe estimation errors. The deviations can be explained by negative attitudes towards testing. Furthermore, this study shows that the extant literature has sparsely addressed estimation of software testing.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["747"]}

This study aims to identify organisational factors that either support or hinder meaningful SCE, identifying their impact on estimation success. Top management\u2019s role is specifically addressed. The study takes a qualitative and explorative case study based approach. In total, 18 semi-structured interviews aided the study of three projects in three organisations. Hence, the transferability of the results is limited. The results suggest that the role of the top management is important in creating prerequisites for meaningful estimation, but their day-to-day participation is not required for successful estimation. Top management may also induce undesired distortion in estimation. Estimation maturity and estimation success seem to have an interrelationship with software process maturity, but there seem to be no significant individual organisational factors, which alone would make estimation successful. Our results validate several distortions and biases reported in the previous studies, and show the SCE research focus has remained on methodologies and technical issues.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["747"]}

{"title": "Towards Ethical Guidelines of Location-Based Games: Challenges in the Urban Gaming World\n", "abstract": " Location-based games\u2014urban games which are played in real life locations\u2014are growing their share in the mobile gaming markets. While these kinds of games have been present since the growing popularity of so-called feature phones, they gained remarkable momentum through the popularity of Niantic Inc.\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go, Ingress and later Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. As modern location-based games are gathering hundred of millions dollars monthly revenue, also related social, economical, and even juridical questions have raised; however, the ethical questions embodied into the location-based games or augmented reality games have not been completely unveiled. As the mobile game industry is growing its importance in the software industry, also business ethics questions should be taken into account during the design and development of game products and services.

{"title": "A Review of Ethical Discussions on Platforms and Ecosystems\n", "abstract": " Since the breakthrough of Apple\u2019s iOS platform and AppStore marketplace a decade ago, different kinds of ecosystems and platforms have conquered the world. In the ecosystem-based business model, a platform owner offers a technological solution (e.g., Apple, Google) for end-users (e.g., smart phone users) and producers (e.g., application and content developers). The platform owner benefits, either directly or indirectly, from the transactions between end-users and producers taking place in the platform. As the ecosystem-based model has gained popularity and de facto status in the industry, also critical voices in ethical problems and questions for the new model has raised. This paper reviews recent literature (n=20) on ethical discussion on platforms and ecosystems in order to summarise the current development and suggest some future avenues. The review show that several disciplines, from law to technology ethics and sociology, are addressing the same phenomena from different view- points. However, furtherstudies are requested to support the building of a comprehensive view on com plex concerns.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}
{"title": "Software engineering studies attractiveness for the highly educated women planning to change career in Finland\n", "abstract": " The software industry is suffering from a widespread labour shortage and, at the same time, universities have not been able to react and provide enough skilled talents for the field. A wide selection of actions has been focused into getting more women for the STEM industries. However, the results have not been as efficient that would have hoped for. This study addresses the question how high-educated women perceive the attractiveness of software engineering studies. The data for the paper is collected with an open internet survey (n=134) from Finnish women who have already done or are planning to make a career change to the software industry. The attitudes towards new and old modes of learning and education are surveyed. This study shows that women perceive industry as attractive and value university education, yet there are overabundance of offering in entry-level training courses and lack of advanced\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}
{"title": "The Return of Evil Companies: Is it okay to profit with the poor at software platforms?\n", "abstract": " In the platform economy, a company (the orchestrator) opens its technological platform for others\u2014ie organisations and individuals (complementors)\u2014to work with and o\ufb00er their own products. This kind of an approach can be seen as a useful tool also in development aid. Here, a company, from a western industrialised country builds and o\ufb00ers a technological plat form for complementors from developing countries to work with. On the one hand, the spill-over e\ufb00ects from successful complementors would create economical well-being in their respective areas. On the other hand, this approach can be argued to be just modernised version of imperialism where rich western corporations are bene\ufb01ting from cheap labour. In this article, we describe the aforementioned problem and present ethical discussion on the dilemma. Finally, this study calls for further work on understanding ethical issues of ecosystem and platform management.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}
{"title": "Individual people as champions in building an emerging software ecosystem\n", "abstract": " An increasing amount of software service providers tend to evolve their platforms into business ecosystems. In the mainstream of extant literature, the ecosystems have been seen as an interconnected system of organizations, mainly ignoring the individual level. However, some previous studies have suggested that collaboration\u2014such as building a new ecosystem\u2014may be depending on individual key persons who are development-oriented and capable of seeing the ecosystem\u2019s value potential already in its early phases.

{"title": "Top Management Support for Software Cost Estimation: A Case Study of the Current Practice and Impacts\n", "abstract": " Context: Despite decades of research in software cost estimation (SCE), the task remains difficult and software project overruns are common. Many researchers and practitioners agree that organisational issues and methodologies are equally important for successful SCE. Regardless of this recent development, SCE research is revolving heavily around methodologies. At the same time project management research has undergone a major shift towards managerial issues, and it found that top management support can be the most important success factor for projects.                 Goal: This study sheds light on top management\u2019s role in SCE by identifying real-life practices for top management participation in SCE, as well as related organisational effects. Also, the impact of top management actions on project success is examined.

{"title": "A Proxy-Based Solution for Asynchronous Telemedical Systems\n", "abstract": " Asynchronous telemedicine systems face many challenges related to information security as the patient's sensitive information and data on medicine dosage is transmitted over a network when monitoring patients and controlling asynchronous telemedical IoT devices. This information may be modified or spied on by a malicious adversary. To make asynchronous telemedicine systems more secure, the authors present a proxy-based solution against data modification and spying attacks in web-based telemedical applications. By obfuscating the executable code of a web application and by continuously dynamically changing obfuscation, the authors' solution makes it more difficult for a piece of malware to attack its target. They use a constructive research approach. They characterize the threat and present an outline of a proposed solution. The benefits and limitations of the proposed solution are discussed.

{"title": "The Impact of a Delayed Software Project on Product Launch Coordination: A Case Study\n", "abstract": " An increasing number of today's products include software as their key component. This means that more and more product launches are depending on software projects, Which are infamous for delays. While the impacts of delays are well studied in the scope of a software project and the company itself, the impacts on the management of launch activities are not very well understood. This study addresses the gap by an in-depth case study of one delayed software project. The results show that the delays may increase the cost of a product launch, as well as decrease the scope and quality of the launch activities. These impacts are influenced by key personnel's motivational factors, which in turn cause lost working time and postponing the work until it is too late to act as planned.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}

In this study, we examine Google Play\u2019s 61 most installed and 20 randomly selected games. The games are studied through the perspectives of external characteristics, control methods, ludology and narrative elements. The study shows the most popular games use a wide range of different elements. However, we note the lack of a proper plot in the majority of the games. Thus we encourage game developers to think through the position of the plot in mobile games.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}

The first objective is to estimate the existence of application vendors locating in developing countries. The second objective is to identify some reasons for developing country software vendors to enter mobile application markets rather than more traditional software markets. We argue that app stores offer a possibility for developing countries to pass some of the problems that come with industrialisation by partly post-industrialising directly. This study is divided to two phases which study the existence of application vendors in developing countries and their characteristics from different viewpoints. The first phase focuses on the analysis of the most popular applications in Google Play, Apple Store and Windows Phone Store.

{"title": "The Theoretical Connections Between Agile Software Development and Innovative Climate\n", "abstract": " Agile software development methods are claimed to fully expose the innovation capabilities of a software development team. In the current business world, where the new innovations are seen as keys for survival and growth of the firm, these development methods have been welcomed and widely adapted. There, however, is a lack of understanding how these methods drive innovation. Therefore, in this study we analyse agile principles and practices against established innovation climate dimensions. The mapping used in analysis is done by the authors and provides a starting point for further scientific discussion. The results show that there is a clear link between practices and several classical innovation climate dimensions. However, a few dimensions are only covered by the agile principles. The study concludes by proposing new avenues for further work in agile software development research.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}

This research investigates stability of software architectures in terms of an object-oriented design principle presented by Robert C. Martin. The research approach is statistical: the design principle is evaluated with a time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) regression model. The empirical sample covers a release history from the Java library Vaadin. The empirical results establish that the design principle cannot be used to characterize the library. Besides delivering this negative empirical result, the research provides the necessary methodological background that is required to understand TSCS modeling.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}

Agile has also been seen as an enabler for relentless product innovation which is critical for growing amount of modern businesses.Innovations and innovation management have been researched using diverse contexts, models and viewpoints. Due to this there are many innovation related studies also in the agile software development context. However, there seems to be little, if any, research on how the agile teams and the related stakeholders innovate. We are especially interested in what kind of process innovations are developed while using agile methodologies and how do these happen.

In the public discussion, the application ecosystem emerged inside the mobile ecosystem is argued to be a key in the differentiation. This has striven the ecosystem orchestrators for recruiting an increasing number of software developers and applications to join in their ecosystem. In this paper, we study how different mobile ecosystems differentiate both in application offering and in the mobile phone users. We use the information gathered from over 800 000 applications and the questionnaire answered by approximately 2 000 university students to study the research questions. The results show that the ecosystems are rather similar in their offering although it is possible to make distinction between the users of different ecosystems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["747"]}
