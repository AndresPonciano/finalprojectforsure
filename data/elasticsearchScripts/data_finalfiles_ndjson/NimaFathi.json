It can be combined with a nuclear power plant to improve its efficiency and minimize its environmental impact. Rather than dumping the waste heat rejected by a nuclear power plant to a wet cooling tower, a better solution may be to connect it to an SCPP. This is particularly true in arid regions. The SCPP can serve the function of a dry cooling tower and produce additional electrical power. In a solar chimney power plant, the energy of buoyant hot air is converted to electrical energy. SCPP includes a collector at ground level covered with a transparent roof. The sun heats the air inside the collector and the ground underneath. A tall chimney is placed at the center of the collector, with a turbine located at the base of the chimney.

Specifically, the system response quantity (SRQ) under investigation is the dimensionless effective thermal conductivity of the domain. A thermally conductive matrix domain is modeled with a thermally conductive circular pore arranged in a uniform packing configuration. Both the pore size and the pore thermal conductivity are varied over a range of values to investigate the relative effects on the SRQ. In this investigation, an emphasis is placed on using code and solution verification techniques to evaluate the obtained results. The method of manufactured solutions (MMS) was used to perform code verification for the study, showing the FEA code to be second\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1421"]}
{"title": "Experimental-Computational Evaluation of Single Particle Behavior in Low Reynolds Number Linear Shear Flow\n", "abstract": " Trajectories of a buoyant spherical solid particle in a linear shear flow were investigated at low Reynolds numbers. A two-dimensional CFD analysis was performed to simulate the solid-fluid flows. Our numerical model, the discrete phase element method, was used to model and simulate the fluid domain and particle motion as the solid phase. The reliability of the computational results was evaluated for the particle trajectory. The agreement between the numerical results with the experimental data was quantified.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1421"]}

The chimney apparatus having at least one inflatable compartment. In some embodiments, the chimney apparatus may have a plurality of toroidal compartments, with the dimensions of the toroidal compartments calculated to maximize the structural integrity of the chimney apparatus, and with the pressure in the compartments dynamically adjusted to minimize deflection under wind loading. The self-supporting chimney apparatus may be used to construct an improved solar updraft tower, with the shape of the tower, the greenhouse surrounding its base, and the ground under the greenhouse optimized together to minimize energy losses.

{"title": "ACOMBINED CYCLE POWER CONVERSION SYSTEM FOR SMALL MODULAR LMFBRS\n", "abstract": " In this chapter, the history of nuclear power plant is presented and need for nuclear power plant for production of electricity is argued. The foundation has been structured and consequently some technology of ongoing research that makes production of electricity from the nuclear power plant more cost effective. For the nuclear reactors to be more comparative with fossil and gas fuel power plants, they need to be as efficient as the traditional power plants are, when it comes to output thermal efficiency. As this chapter suggests, utilizing the combined cycles to drive and produce electricity via nuclear fuel, makes more sense to own them from both return on investment, total cost of ownership and efficient for their owners, namely electricity companies. Results of modeling a combined cycle Brayton-Rankine power conversion system are presented in this chapter and based model reactor for this purpose was chosen to be, the Molten Salt Reactors type. The Rankine bottoming cycle appears to offer significant advantages over the recuperated Brayton cycle. The overall cycle in the modeling for purpose of writing this chapter, was optimized as a unit and lower pressure Rankine systems did seem to be more efficient. The combined cycle requires a lot less circulating water for a heat dump than current power plants. The Rankine", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1421"]}
{"title": "Hydrogen Production Plant\n", "abstract": " Research is going forward to produce hydrogen based on nuclear energy. Hydrogen production processes necessitate high temperatures that can be reached in fourth generation nuclear reactors. Technological studies are now under way that aim to define and qualify components that in the future will enable us to retrieve and transfer heat produced by these reactors. Hydrogen combustion turbine power could be one of the solutions to our future energy needs, particularly when it comes to on-peak demand for electricity, but until recently the problem with hydrogen power was its production for use as an energy source. Although hydrogen is the most common element in the known universe, actually capturing it for energy use is a process that itself usually requires some form of fuel or energy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1421"]}
{"title": "On the form of the power equation for modeling solar chimney power plant systems\n", "abstract": " Recently several mathematical models of a solar chimney power plant were derived, studied for a variety of boundary conditions, and compared against CFD calculations. The importance of these analyses is about the accuracy of the derived pressure drop and output power equation for solar chimney power plant systems (SCPPS). We examine the assumptions underlying the derivation and present reasons to believe that some of the derived equations, specifically the power equation in this model, may require a correction to be applicable in more realistic conditions. The analytical resutls are compared against the available experimental data from the Manzanares power plant.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1421"]}
{"title": "Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Assessment of Mechanical Response of Open-Cell Porous Media.\n", "abstract": " The present work is devoted to V&V of the elastic and plastic behavior of porous materials obtained from micromechanical modeling. Nonlinear numerical analyses were conducted using the finite element method (FEM), with the nano-porous gold media being the three-dimensional model system. The effective elastic and plastic response of the model structures, encompassing a wide range of porosity and pore geometry, were simulated using ANSYS. Attention is directed to the uniaxial stress-strain response as a function of the porous microstructure. The model geometries were generated based on interconnected and non-overlapping pore topologies arranged in an orderly manner. The sensitivity of the numerical result to the pore morphology was examined by comparing the normalized effective modulus of elasticity for all cases at the same porosity. Model verification with theoretical solutions was considered for open-cell foams. As expected, the introduction of porosity was found to reduce the elastic modulus of the media. In addition, stress distribution in the porous microstructure was significantly influenced by the pore morphology. The approach can be readily generalized to study a wide variety of porous solids from nano-structure materials to geological structures.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1421"]}
