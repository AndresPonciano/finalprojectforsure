{"title": "On the use of domain terms in source code\n", "abstract": " Information about the problem domain of the software and the solution it implements is often embedded by developers in comments and identifiers. When using software developed by others or when are new to a project, programmers know little about how domain information is reflected in the source code. Programmers often learn about the domain from external sources such as books, articles, etc. Hence, it is important to use in comments and identifiers terms that are commonly known in the domain literature, as it is likely that programmers will use such terms when searching the source code. The paper presents a case study that investigated how domain terms are used in comments and identifiers. The study focused on three research questions: (1) to what degree are domain terms found in the source code of software from a particular problem domain?; (2) which is the preponderant source of domain terms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "100\n", "authors": ["2284"]}

However, when trying to find the right video to watch for a task at hand, developers have little information at their disposal to quickly decide if they found the right video or not. This can lead to missing the best tutorials or wasting time watching irrelevant ones. Other external sources of information for developers, such as StackOverflow, have benefited from the existence of informative tags, which help developers to quickly gauge the relevance of posts and find related ones. We argue that the same is valid also for videos and propose the first set of approaches to automatically generate tags describing the contents of software development video tutorials.

{"title": "Accurately predicting the location of code fragments in programming video tutorials using deep learning\n", "abstract": " Background: Video programming tutorials are becoming a popular resource for developers looking for quick answers to a specific programming problem or trying to learn a programming topic in more depth. Since the most important source of information for developers in many such videos is source code, it is important to be able to accurately extract this code from the screen, such that developers can easily integrate it into their programs. Aims: Our main goal is to facilitate the accurate and noise-free extraction of code appearing in programming video tutorials. In particular, in this paper we aim to accurately predict the location of source code in video frames. This will allow for the dramatic reduction of noise when using extraction techniques such as Optical Character Recognition, which could otherwise extract a large amount of irrelevant text (eg, text found in menu items, package hierarchy, etc.).

One of the approaches to this task is based on leveraging the lexical information found in the source code by means of Information Retrieval techniques. All IR-based approaches to concept location are highly dependent on the queries written by the users. An IR approach, even though good on average, might fail when the input query is poor. Currently there is no way to tell when a query leads to poor results for IR-based concept location, unless a considerable effort is put into analyzing the results after the fact. We propose an approach based on recent advances in the field of IR research, which aims at automatically determining the difficulty a query poses to an IR-based concept location technique. We plan to evaluate several models and relate them to IR performance metrics.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2284"]}

{"title": "Code localization in programming screencasts\n", "abstract": " Programming screencasts are growing in popularity and are often used by developers as a learning source. The source code shown in these screencasts is often not available for download or copy-pasting. Without having the code readily available, developers have to frequently pause a video to transcribe the code. This is time-consuming and reduces the effectiveness of learning from videos. Recent approaches have applied Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to automatically extract source code from programming screencasts. One of their major limitations, however, is the extraction of noise such as the text information in the menu, package hierarchy, etc. due to the imprecise approximation of the code location on the screen. This leads to incorrect, unusable code. We aim to address this limitation and propose an approach to significantly improve the accuracy of code localization in programming\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2284"]}

While it has been shown to support essential maintenance and evolution tasks, recovering traceability links between related software artifacts is a time consuming and error prone task. As such, substantial research has been done to reduce this barrier to adoption by at least partially automating traceability link recovery. In particular, recent work has shown that supervised machine learning can be effectively used for automating traceability link recovery, as long as there is sufficient data (i.e., labeled traceability links) to train a classification model. Unfortunately, the amount of data required by these techniques is a serious limitation, given that most software systems rarely have traceability information to begin with.

Recent work has identified this challenge and proposed solutions that identify and extract source code from video tutorials in order to make it readily available to developers or other tools. A crucial component in these approaches is the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine used to transcribe the source code shown on screen.

Developers have a hard time realizing this before going through the search results, which, in the case of \"bad\" queries means time and effort lost looking at irrelevant information. In this scenario, developers have to reformulate the query, often without pointers on how to improve it.
