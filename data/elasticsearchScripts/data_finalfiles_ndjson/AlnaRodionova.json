{"title": "Safe at any speed: A simulation-based test harness for autonomous vehicles\n", "abstract": " The testing of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) requires driving the AV billions of miles under varied scenarios in order to find bugs, accidents and otherwise inappropriate behavior. Because driving a real AV that many miles is too slow and costly, this motivates the use of sophisticated \u2018world simulators\u2019, which present the AV\u2019s perception pipeline with realistic input scenes, and present the AV\u2019s control stack with realistic traffic and physics to which to react. Thus the simulator is a crucial piece of any CAD toolchain for AV testing. In this work, we build a test harness for driving an arbitrary AV\u2019s code in a simulated world. We demonstrate this harness by using the game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA) as world simulator for AV testing. Namely, our AV code, for both perception and control, interacts in real-time with the game engine to drive our AV in the GTA world, and we search for weather conditions and AV operating\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1685"]}
{"title": "A driver\u2019s license test for driverless vehicles\n", "abstract": " This article elaborates the approaches that can be used to verify an autonomous vehicle (AV) before giving it a driver\u2019s license. Formal methods applied to the problem of AV verification include theorem proving, reachability analysis, synthesis, and maneuver design. Theorem proving is an interactive technique in which the computer is largely responsible for demonstrating that the model satisfies the specification, with occasional help from the user. The latter provides lemmas and axioms that the tool leverages to advance the proof towards its conclusion. Reachability analysis is used to verify the operation of the AV during navigation. This provides an extension of onboard diagnostics to whole-AV operation, where the diagnosis does not concern one component\u2019s requirements, but the safety of the entire AV. Another approach is to design correct-by-construction controllers from preverified maneuvers. The basic idea\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1685"]}
{"title": "Learning-to-Fly: Learning-based collision avoidance for scalable urban air mobility\n", "abstract": " With increasing urban population, there is global interest in Urban Air Mobility (UAM), where hundreds of autonomous Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) execute missions in the airspace above cities. Unlike traditional human-inthe-loop air traffic management, UAM requires decentralized autonomous approaches that scale for an order of magnitude higher aircraft densities and are applicable to urban settings. We present Learning-to-Fly (L2F), a decentralized on-demand airborne collision avoidance framework for multiple UAS that allows them to independently plan and safely execute missions with spatial, temporal and reactive objectives expressed using Signal Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem of predictively avoiding collisions between two UAS without violating mission objectives as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). This however is intractable to solve online. Instead, we develop L2F, a two\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1685"]}
{"title": "How safe is safe enough? Automatic safety constraints boundary estimation for decision-making in automated vehicles\n", "abstract": " The determination of safety assurances for automated driving vehicles is one of the most critical challenges in the industry today. Several behavioral safety models for automated driving have been proposed recently and standards discussions are on the way. In this paper we present a method to automatically explore the performance of automated vehicle (AV) safety models utilizing robustness of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) specifications as a continuous metric of safety. We present a case study of the Responsibility Sensitive Safety model (RSS), introducing a safety evaluation pipeline based on the CARLA driving simulator, RSS and a set of safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method automatically extracts safety relevant profiles for these scenarios providing practical parametric boundaries for implementation. Furthermore, we evaluate the trade-offs between safety and utility within the safe RSS parameter space\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1685"]}
{"title": "Stability of two-layer fluid flow\n", "abstract": " The problem of two-layer convective flow of viscous incompressible fluids in a horizontal channel with solid walls in the presence of evaporation is considered in the Oberbeck\u2013Boussinesq approximation assuming that the interface is an undeformable thermocapillary surface and taking into account the Dufour effect in the upper layer which is a mixture of gas and liquid vapor. The effects of longitudinal temperature gradients at the boundaries of the channel and the thicknesses of the layer on the flow pattern and the evaporation rate are studied under conditions of specified gas flow and the absence of vapor flow on the upper boundary of the channel. It is shown that the long-wavelength asymptotics for the decrement is determined from the flow characteristics, the longwavelength perturbations occurring in the system decay monotonically, and the thermal instability mechanism is not potentially the most\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1685"]}

The spectrum of the characteristic perturbations of all classes of the flows is investigated and analytical representations of the eigennumbers and eigenfunctions of the corresponding spectral problem are obtained in the zeroth approximation. Stability of the flows with respect to longwave perturbations and the possibility of existence of oscillatory regimes are proved.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1685"]}
{"title": "Learning-'N-Flying: A Learning-based, Decentralized Mission Aware UAS Collision Avoidance Scheme\n", "abstract": " Urban Air Mobility, the scenario where hundreds of manned and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) carry out a wide variety of missions (e.g. moving humans and goods within the city), is gaining acceptance as a transportation solution of the future. One of the key requirements for this to happen is safely managing the air traffic in these urban airspaces. Due to the expected density of the airspace, this requires fast autonomous solutions that can be deployed online. We propose Learning-'N-Flying (LNF) a multi-UAS Collision Avoidance (CA) framework. It is decentralized, works on-the-fly and allows autonomous UAS managed by different operators to safely carry out complex missions, represented using Signal Temporal Logic, in a shared airspace. We initially formulate the problem of predictive collision avoidance for two UAS as a mixed-integer linear program, and show that it is intractable to solve online. Instead, we first develop Learning-to-Fly (L2F) by combining: a) learning-based decision-making, and b) decentralized convex optimization-based control. LNF extends L2F to cases where there are more than two UAS on a collision path. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can run online (computation time in the order of milliseconds), and under certain assumptions has failure rates of less than 1% in the worst-case, improving to near 0% in more relaxed operations. We show the applicability of our scheme to a wide variety of settings through multiple case studies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1685"]}
