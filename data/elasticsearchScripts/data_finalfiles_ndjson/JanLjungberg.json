{"title": "From control to drift: the dynamics of corporate information infastructures\n", "abstract": " Firms are investing considerable resources to create large information infrastructures able to fulfil their varied information-processing and communication needs. The more the drive towards globalization, the more such infrastructures become crucial. The'wiring'of the corporation should be done in a way that is aligned with its corporate strategy-it is global and generates value. This book presents six in-depth case studies of large corporations-AstraZeneca, IBM, Norsk Hydro, Roche, SKF, and Statoil-which offer a rich picture of the main issues involved in information infrastructure implementation and management. Far from being a linear process, the use of the information infrastructure is in fact an open-ended process, in many cases out of control. Current management models and consulting advice do not seem to be able to cope with such a business landscape. This book provides the reader with interpretations and theories that can foster a different understanding and approach.", "num_citations": "1575\n", "authors": ["850"]}
{"title": "The Power of Gifts: organizing social relationships in open source communities\n", "abstract": " In writings on the open source software development model, it is often argued that it is successful as a result of the gift economy that embraces activities in online communities. However, the theoretical foundations for this argument are seldom discussed and empirically tested. Starting with the \u2018classic\u2019 theories of gift giving, we discuss how they need to be developed in order to explain gift\u2010giving practices in digital domains. In this paper, we argue that the gift economy is important, not only because it creates openness, but also because it organizes relationships between people in a certain way. Open source software development relies on gift giving as a way of getting new ideas and prototypes out into circulation. This also implies that the giver gets power from giving away. This power is used as a way of guaranteeing the quality of the code. We relate this practice to how gifts, in the form of new scientific knowledge\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "707\n", "authors": ["850"]}
{"title": "Open source movements as a model for organising\n", "abstract": " Open source software such as the operating system Linux has in a few years created much attention as an alternative way to develop and distribute software. Open source is to let anyone have access to the source code, so that they can modify it. Open source can be seen as a movement, where communities of highly skilled programmers collectively develop software, often of a quality that outperforms commercial proprietary software. These movements are based on virtual networking on the Internet and the web. They are loosely coupled communities kept together by strong common values related to hacker culture. Work seems to be totally distributed, delegated and loosely coupled. The highly skilled members contribute to the collective effort of free software development. In this paper the open source phenomenon is investigated from different perspectives.

In this paper we argue that the supplier in open innovation networks tends to get a more active role as a creative peer producer, rather than merely a contractual deliverer. A comparative case study of the mobile phone platforms iPhone and Android is used to analyze this shift in innovative value creation. The notion of generative capacity is introduced to the research on open innovation, suggesting that it is generativity rather than openness that drives the platforms\u2019 aggregated wealth.

One question we address is what happens when we import passive descriptive theories from other disciplines and use them as a basis for active design. We find that speech act theory may be useful, but only if we are aware of its shortcomings. By surveying various criticisms of speech-act-based design along with extensions and alternative approaches, we attempt to pinpoint these shortcomings.

Based on the messages and the interviews, we clustered the messages into different genres. Most of the literature on genres of organizational communication has focused on the genres themselves, e.g. e-mail messages constituting different instances of genres.

One way of addressing this problem is to focus on how information is socially transformed into knowledge. This includes how knowledge is handled in practice and how the knowledge produced is qualified as being something worth knowing and acting upon. Two well-established practices for doing this are the refereeing system and the peer review process. These are used in scientific communities as a means of validating and legitimating knowledge, for example by reviewing journal papers before publishing or project proposals before granting funds, etc. This paper argues that peer review is a useful concept when looking at knowledge creation and legitimization in organizations.

{"title": "From workflow to conversation\n", "abstract": " This thesis is about designing information technology to support communicative work. The thesis has a theoretical focus, informed by two empirical studies, but the aim is not to formulate a grand theory, but rather to find new concepts and patterns of thought useful for design. It is based on five papers dealing with the phenomena work, organization, communication and design of information technology. Departure is taken in the view that the role of language is central in the postmodern arena, both as work (i.e. work is communication) and in constituting organizations. While there is research based on this assumption, there is still a great need to find new concepts and new metaphors when designing information technology to support communication and communicative work. The thesis examines, criticizes and elaborates communication models such as speech act theory, conversation analysis and genre theory as a foundation for design In doing this, there is a number of classical issues in industrial work design applicable to communicative work as well, e.g. deskilling versus learning, rule following versus empowerment, local or global control, routinization versus flexibility, workplace democracy, participation in design, etc. These classical questions of work organization and potential effects of information technology on individuals, and organizations are addressed as well.", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["850"]}

In this paper we extend the speech act approach with ideas from conversation analysis, in order to overcome some of the criticisms. The discourse concept in the tradition of discourse analysis is used to denote routinized and procedural activities in organisations, ie, as a set of coherent speech acts for which there exist strict organizational rules regarding their sequence, who may perform them, under which circumstances etc. The conversation concept in the tradition of conversation analysis denotes a contingent, situated activity, where the language user is viewed as a competent and autonomous agent, guided by the existing social rules and conventions. The problems with IT-design are interpreted in terms of striving for a balance between efficiency, routinization and global control on the one hand, and empowerment, skill and flexibility for the individual, on the other. Finally we introduce a set of metaphors to illustrate the role played by information technology as a mediator of social rules and conventions.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["850"]}
{"title": "22 High Noon at OS Corral: Duels and Shoot-Outs in Open Source Discourse\n", "abstract": " The open source software (OSS) movement can be related to the societal changes that started in the late 1960s: the rise of a network society supported by new information and communication technologies and the rise of new forms of collective actions, which also have been referred to as \u201cnew social movements\u201d(see Touraine 1981; Melucci 1996; Th\u00f6rn 1997). The emergence of these movements has been explained by changes in the relations between the economic, political, and cultural powers and institutions that have supported a transition from a modern to a late modern or postindustrial society and lately been linked to an understanding of the importance of the rise of a global network society and new forms of communication (Castells 1996; Giddens 1990). The emergence of a network society, or information society, has involved new conflicts regarding the control over information, knowledge, symbolic capital, and social relationships. These are conflicts closely connected to unequal or transformed power relations between different social positions in the new global society. According to both Th\u00f6rn (1997) and Melucci (1996), it is in this social climate of opposition, ambivalence, and conflict that new forms of collective actions have emerged.American contemporary movements of the 1960s gave rise, as Castells (1996) has shown, to an intellectual climate that contributed to and inspired the march of technical innovations and the \u201cculture of IT\u201d. However, the rise of information technology also gave birth to conflicting ideas about how the tools to create and bring forth information should be developed, and what they should look like.

The relative novelty of its occurrence in a business context, the lack of well-grounded best practice and the scarcity of research, result in organizational decision-makers having to rely on vendor descriptions and trade press articles to make sense of social media. By using management fashion theory and discourse analysis, we examine how a management fashion discourse on social media unfolds and enacts social media as a disruptive force that managers must consider in the form of eg strategies, normative guidelines and policies.

In this paper we explain this development as a dependence on historical formations, shaped by different ways of justifying the use of open source during different periods of time. These formations are described as arrangements of different justificatory logics within a certain time frame or a certain group of actors motivating the use of free and open source software by referring to different potentialities.

Although formally grounded on the same civic principles, the two authorities have significantly different approaches to social media as a way to generate internal and external legitimacy. SIA has mainly implemented an e-government approach to rationalize services to become more efficient and customer oriented, by using social media as one of several media channels. The police force, however, adopted an e-governance approach to build legitimacy through interaction and reflexive discussion between government and citizens as a way to create transparency and nuance citizens\u2019 attitude towards the police force.

Rather, it can be threatening civic legitimacy. With the introduction of social media, a new channel opens possibilities for officers to meet the public and interact in more personal and creative ways than previously. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, have become important in people\u2019s everyday lives as well as for organizational use. These technologies encourage self-expression, and allow users to create and share content, to comment and show appreciation or dislike of content. It also makes social networks visible. For public authorities, social media is a double-edged sword. It is a promising technology for dialogue with the citizens, but it may also facilitate the mobilization and coordination of criticism from the public. This is due to the dynamics and disruption afforded by the social media platforms. With the Swedish police officers\u2019 Facebook interaction as empirical setting, the aim of this paper is to discuss how the increased use of social media affects the police\u2019s legitimacy work.

{"title": "Justifying the value of open source\n", "abstract": " Over the last decade, free and open source software (FOSS) has gradually become recognized by different actors in society outside the FOSS communities and increasingly incorporated in corporate software development contexts, challenging proprietary software practices. Most literature describing this transition is focusing on the value of using FOSS as an efficient alternative to established models for software development. This focus on efficiency and economic value of FOSS is not sufficient if we want to gain a deeper understanding of the many aspects of FOSS values in the intersection of corporations and movements In order to articulate these different values, we propose a theoretical framework of justificatory logics including a civic, domestic, inspirational, popular, market and industrial logic. First we make an analysis of the history of FOSS, identifying how these logics have developed over time. We argue that this development forms the backbone of an emerging configuration of these logics, manifesting a new spirit of FOSS in terms of the adoption of free and open source software, methods and practices in corporations today. This new spirit is then analyzed based on interviews with programmers employed by firms engaging in FOSS. By understanding how these justificatory logics come to play and interplay, corporations that want to adopt FOSS can gain strategic advantages beyond efficiency.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["850"]}

We then discuss how this transformation towards a platform, was shaped by both the evolving digital materiality of the artefacts especially in terms of convergence and generativity, and the discursive work conducted by Microsoft through their official Microsoft Azure blog.

{"title": "Combining Actor Network Theory and genre theory to understand the evolution of digital genres\n", "abstract": " In this paper we argue that a combination of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Genre Theory can constitute a theoretical framework for understanding how digital genres evolve. Genre theory states that genres evolve over time through reciprocal interaction between institutionalized practices and individual action; that they develop from actors\u00e2 responses to recurrent situations, and are shaped around characteristics as content, form, functionality and purpose. Genres emerge out of practice and at the same time they shape that practice. While genre theory can describe the characteristics of a genre, it cannot handle the process of how a genre is formed and what powers and forces are involved in this shaping process. In order to address this problem, several authors have incorporated structuration theory into genre analysis. However, structuration theory can only catch these constitutional processes of genre in a very broad manner. As a genre is evolving and stabilizing over time in interplay with different actors, it goes beyond what is possible to explain only by means of structuration theory. Instead, ANT could work as a tool to capture the process of how a genre takes form in negotiations with different stakeholders. In this paper we discuss how genre theory and ANT can be combined in a framework for analyzing emerging genres. We apply this theoretical framework on an e-newspaper project that embodies a new genre in the making. We will here show how evolving genre characteristics are developed, formed and stabilized in a negotiation and struggle between the involved actors when they translate their interests in ways that finally are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["850"]}

Over the last years a growing discourse on digital innovation has emerged, while the digital entrepreneur has been more rarely addressed. In this conceptual paper, we discuss the nature of digital entrepreneurship based on a theoretical framework rooted in the discourse on digital innovation and the characteristics of digital artefacts.

{"title": "Generativity and Innovation in Smartphone Ecosystems\n", "abstract": " Advances in science and technology have created promising new opportunities for industries and economies to create value, which have also made them more complex as innovations can contain specialized knowledge from various disciplines. Under these conditions, firms are said to benefit from acting more openly (Chesbrough, 2003) within cross-organizational innovation systems (Cooke, 2001), clusters (Porter, 1998), or ecosystems (Moore, 1995) rather than as sole competitors. New relations emerge as companies strive to meet the challenges of increased user demands, higher research and development (R&D) costs, and shorter product life cycles, which put the organization\u2019s capacity to adapt and innovate into focus (Teece, 2007). Such complexities cause liaisons that form more or less viable ecosystems for R&D and innovation (Rohrbeck et al., 2009). These relations emerge in order to jointly manage certain innovation challenges, explicitly linking the", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["850"]}
{"title": "High noon at OS Corral\n", "abstract": " Since the late 60\u2019s, there\u2019s been a rise in the number and visability of collective actions in society, which have been referred to as\" new social movements.\" Examples include environmental-, peace-and women's rights movements, and also an increasing number of transnational networks of nongovernmental organizations (NGO\u2019s). The emergence of these movements has been explained by changes in the relations between the economic, political and cultural powers and institutions that have supported a transition from a modern to a postmodern or postindustrial society. These changes have lately been linked to an understanding of the importance of the rise of a networked society and new forms of communication, which has led to an increased level of mobility, flexibility and a greater complexity and reflexivity within contemporary social institutions (see Castells 1996, Giddens 1990). The British sociologist Anthony Giddens describes this intensification of transnational relations as \u201cworldwide social relations which link distinct localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring miles away and vice versa\u201d(Giddens 1990: 64). The emergence of a network society, or information society, has also involved new conflicts regarding the control over information, knowledge, symbolic capital and social relationships. These are conflicts closely connected to unequal or transformed power relations between different social positions in the new global society. It is in this social climate of opposition, ambivalence and conflict that new forms of movements have emerged (Th\u00f6rn, 1997).

It is a vital part of most theories, methods and approaches dealing with organizational development, even if change and change management is not always addressed explicitly.

{"title": "Learning, Innovation and IT-Usage-A Research Approach to Regional Development.\n", "abstract": " Regional clusters of companies are becoming an increasingly important focus of government industrial policy makers and researchers. A cluster is a network of companies in an industrial sector where suppliers, customers, consultants, etc. interact together with regional policymakers and universities. Sometimes the individual firms compete, and sometimes they collaborate. The delimited characteristics of a cluster to a regional area and an industrial sector, makes it possible to view the cluster as an arena or laboratory. The concept of regions as laboratories, which is the base for the present paper, does not have a policy orientation. Instead, it stresses the interactive and cooperative aspects, which emerge organically in a regional cluster. The paper presents the formation of a research arena in cooperation between the University College of Bor\u00e5s and the industry organization of Swedish mail order companies for studies of learning and innovations in IT usage within the cluster. The strategy to establish the arena, formulation of research questions and initial experiences are presented.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["850"]}
{"title": "A Narrative Mode of Change Management\n", "abstract": " Change projects put a high demand on people\u2019s ability to change mindset. It requires motivation and commitment to take on another perspective than the existing one. Common methods like BPR, and TQM, tend to fail in motivating and engaging people sufficiently to reach the goals. In this paper we outline an alternative method for driving change management. We propose the use of myths, tales, and stories as triggers in change projects in order to create a creative and dynamic atmosphere in which change can be achieved. Even though there is by now a rather substantial literature on narratives in organization theory, very little research has focused on narrative as a vehicle for change and organizational development. Myths are interesting because they serve as a tool for formulating and recapturing a worldview; they integrate people into organizational culture and they can guide people in their individual psychological development.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["850"]}
{"title": "Being filmed at work: How police perceive citizens' use of cameras to conduct sousveillance\n", "abstract": " Today\u2019s widespread use of camera-equipped smartphones means that anyone may easily be filmed in public, and-through social media-exposed to a large audience whilst conducting their daily work. Police officers belong to an occupation that frequently has to encounter this situation. The police is a public authority with a broad societal mission aimed at reducing crime and increasing security in society, but is also entitled to make use of force at work. The latter is a fact that places high demands on them to organize and conduct their work in accordance with applicable laws and guidelines to ensure legal security for citizens, and to provide transparency and accountability. We intend to investigate what consequences citizens\u2019 use of this wearable technology with built in cameras have on police officers\u2019 individual practices. This research in progress paper will therefore address the question: How do police perceive citizens\u2019 use of cameras to document them while conducting work? To answer the question, we conducted a qualitative study using the Swedish Police as a case, where in-depth interviews with police officers constitute the main data source. Theoretically, we draw upon on research on technological affordances, accountability, surveillance and sousveillance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["850"]}
{"title": "Like, Share and Follow: A Conceptualisation of Social Buttons on the Web\n", "abstract": " In this theoretical and argumentative paper we analyse the implications of social buttons as used on social networking sites (SNSs). Although social buttons have been around for many years, there is still a scarcity of research on their effects despite their pivotal functions for the success of SNSs. We conceptualise these buttons as Like buttons, Share buttons and Follow buttons and analyse them and their associated actions through the lens of social capital theory. Our analysis shows how the clicker and the clickee are affected differently through these social buttons, and in the process, we also propose seven concepts to describe the social implications of these buttons. Having discussed these concepts, we conclude the paper by offering three contributions; (a) the distinguishing between the clicker and the clickee; (b) the subtle but yet distinct differences between buttons, and; (c) a set of ways through which\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["850"]}

We also argue, however, that these issues need to be formulated differently today. In its first decades, computerization strengthened rationalization efforts in industry. IT was claimed to increase Taylorism and alienation. As we move into the postindustrial society, the situation is almost the reverse. People no longer discuss \u201cdeskilling\u201d and \u201cdequalification of work\u201d. Instead we encounter expressions like \u201cuser empowerment\u201d and \u201cthe good IT-society\u201d.

While brute facts concern the frequencies of word occurences, type-token ratios of specific words and other kind of statistical models of word occurences and relations among words, institutional facts presuppose the existence of certain human institutions, ie systems of constitutive rules. In this paper we argue that information retrieval mostly has been focussing on the brute facts of language. When information retrieval and document management systems are to be designed in organizational settings, we need to take the institutional facts of language into account. We propose a way of combining statistical techniques of treating brute facts with pragmatically oriented methods of using institutional facts as the foundation for design of information retrieval systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["850"]}
