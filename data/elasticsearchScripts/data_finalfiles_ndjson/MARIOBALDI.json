In order for the participants in a videoconference call to interact naturally, the end-to-end delay should be below human perception; even though an objective and unique figure cannot be set, 100 ms is widely recognized as the desired one-way delay requirement for interaction. Since the global propagation delay can be about 100 ms, the actual end-to-end delay budget available to the system designer (excluding propagation delay) can be no more than 10 ms. We identify the components of the end-to-end delay in various configurations with the objective of understanding how it can be kept below the desired 10-ms bound.

TDP together with resource reservation enable real-time delivery of packets with no loss due to congestion and constant jitter of one time frame (TF)\u2013typically between 12.5 \u00b5s and 125 \u00b5s. Resource reservation for a call (or multiple calls) over a TDP network requires to find a schedule.

This work studies the call blocking probability as a function of the link utilization, since call blocking can possibly lead to low link utilization.

Genetic algorithms recently proved themselves excellent tools for giving good, yet approximate, solution to hard-to-solve problems.

{"title": "Ring versus tree embedding for real-time group multicast\n", "abstract": " In general topology networks, routing from one node to another over a tree embedded in the network is intuitively a good strategy, since it typically results in a route length of O(log n) links, being n the number of nodes in the network. Routing from one node to another over a ring embedded in the network would result in route length of O(n) links. However, in group (many-to-many) multicast, the overall number of links traversed by each packet, i.e., the networks elements on which resources must be possibly reserved, is typically O(N) for both tree and ring embedding, where N is the size of the group. This paper focuses on the tree versus ring embedding for real-time group multicast in which all packets should reach all other nodes in the group with a bounded end-to-end delay.

However, automating the summarization process is not trivial as the summary should strike a good balance between generality and specificity, while there is no gold standard for doing so.In our approach to summarizing user information, dubbed SUM, we develop two scoring mechanisms that cooperatively optimize for polarizing criteria. After mapping user activity information onto a category tree, the scoring mechanisms highlight the most representative tree node (or summary); the node provides an aggregated view of the activities most characteristic of the user. We evaluate our approach by using web activity on the network of a large Cellular Service Provider and summarizing it to devise interests of individual users as well as groups.

In this paper, we consider a quasi-static fading channel in which both public and private messages must be sent from the transmitter to the receivers, and we aim at designing suitable coding and modulation schemes to achieve such a target. For this purpose, we adopt the error rate as a metric, by considering that reliability (security) is achieved when a sufficiently low (high) error rate is experienced at the receiving side. We show that some conditions exist on the system feasibility, and that some outage probability must be tolerated to cope with the fading nature of the channel.

In order to design and assess practical coding schemes, we use the error rate as a metric of the performance achieved by the authorized receiver (Bob) and the unauthorized receiver (Eve). We study the system feasibility, and show that two different levels of protection against noise are required on the public and the secret messages.

{"title": "Network Function Modeling and Performance Estimation.\n", "abstract": " This work introduces a methodology for the modelization of network functions focused on the identification of recurring execution patterns as basic building blocks and aimed at providing a platform independent representation. By mapping each modeling building block on specific hardware, the performance of the network function can be estimated in terms of maximum throughput that the network function can achieve on the specific execution platform. The approach is such that once the basic modeling building blocks have been mapped, the estimate can be computed automatically for any modeled network function. Experimental results on several sample network functions show that although our approach cannot be very accurate without taking in consideration traffic characteristics, it is very valuable for those application where even loose estimates are key. One such example is orchestration in network functions virtualization (NFV) platforms, as well as in general virtualization platforms where virtual machine placement is based also on the performance of network services offered to them. Being able to automatically estimate the performance of a virtualized network function (VNF) on different execution hardware, enables optimal placement of VNFs themselves as well as the virtual hosts they serve, while efficiently utilizing available resources.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["346"]}
{"title": "Packet capture and analysis on MEDINA, a massively distributed network data caching platform\n", "abstract": " Traffic capture and analysis is key to many domains including network management, security and network forensics. Traditionally, it is performed by a dedicated device accessing traffic at a specific point within the network through a link tap or a port of a node mirroring packets. This approach is problematic because the dedicated device must be equipped with a large amount of computation and storage resources to store and analyze packets. Alternatively, in order to achieve scalability, analysis can be performed by a cluster of hosts. However, this is normally located at a remote location with respect to the observation point, hence requiring to move across the network a large volume of captured traffic. To address this problem, this paper presents an algorithm to distribute the task of capturing, processing and storing packets traversing a network across multiple packet forwarding nodes (e.g., IP routers).

{"title": "Enforcement of dynamic HTTP policies on resource-constrained residential gateways\n", "abstract": " Given that nowadays users access content mostly through mobile apps and web services, both based on HTTP, several filtering applications, such as parental control, malware detection, and corporate policy enforcement, require inspecting Universal Resource Locators (URLs) contained in HTTP requests. Currently, such filtering is most commonly performed in end devices or in middleboxes. Filtering applications running on end devices are less resource intensive because they operate only on traffic from a single user and possibly leverage a hook at the HTTP level to access protocol data, but it is left to the user whether to execute them. On the other hand, middleboxes present the challenge of ensuring that they lay on the path of all the traffic from any relevant device.

{"title": "Dynamic optical switching for a greener Internet\n", "abstract": " The continuous growth of the Internet might turn network power consumption into a major issue. There is a huge potential for decreasing future Internet energy requirements by synchronizing the operation of routers and scheduling traffic in advance, thus reducing complexity - e.g., header processing, buffer size, switching fabric speedup and memory access bandwidth speedup. Moreover, a lower complexity operation enables the realization of dynamic all-optical switching, which further reduces power consumption because (i) optical switching fabrics have lower power consumption than electrical ones (ii) dynamic switching enables a more efficient link utilization than static whole channel switching. Finally, an architecture is proposed for gradually deploying these technological solutions in the Internet while immediately starting to benefit from its power reduction potential and complementing them with energy-aware\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["346"]}
