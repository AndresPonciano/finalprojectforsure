{"title": "Informal communication in organizations: Form, function, and technology\n", "abstract": " The intricate choreography necessary to do work in organizations requires effective coordination. This paper uses a variety of data from R & D organizations to describe informal communication and its functions in organizations. It argues that informal communication, generally mediated by physical proximity, is crucial for coordination to occur. Informal communication is frequent in R&D organizations, it aids organizational members in learning about each other and their work, it supports both production work and the social relations that underlie it, and it provides a critical facility that collaborators rely on to start joint work, maintain it, and drive it to conclusion. Without informal communication, many collaborations would undoubtedly not occur and others would break up before becoming successful. In this light we present two telecommunication systems designed to support informal communication through artificial proximity. The VideoWindow system is a wide-screen video teleconferencing system continuously linking public places, and Cruiser is a switched, desk-top video communications system that implements a metaphor of a virtual hallway. Both systems have the potential to support informal communication, but experience with the VideoWindow and analysis of Cruiser suggest that careful attention to implementation detail will determine if they are successful.", "num_citations": "956\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

{"title": "Understanding effects of proximity on collaboration: Implications for technologies to support remote collaborative work\n", "abstract": " This chapter analyzes why computers and telecommunications have not created computermediated work environments for collaboration that are as successful as physically shared environments. Our goals are, first, to identify the mechanisms by which proximity makes collaboration easier, concentrating on the way it facilitates interpersonal interaction and awareness; and second, to evaluate how current computer-mediated communication technologies provide or fail to provide the key benefits of proximity. We use a decompositional framework that examines how visibility, copresence, mobility, cotemporality and other affordances of media affect the important collaborative tasks of initiating conversation, establishing common ground, and maintaining awareness of potentially relevant changes in the collaborative environment.Increasingly, collaborating with other people is as likely to take place over distance or time as it is face-to-face. An abundance of new communication technologies has been developed to mediate remote collaboration: e-mail, bulletin boards, instant messaging, document sharing, videoconferencing, awareness services, and others. Yet collaboration at a distance remains substantially harder to accomplish than collaboration when members of a work group are collocated. For example, in collaboration at a distance, communication is typically less frequent, characterized by longer lags between messages, and more effortful. In this chapter we consider why these computer-mediated work environments are not as successful as physically shared ones.

On the one hand, networks may be used to foster electronic marketplaces characterized by more ephemeral transactions between buyers and sellers. Also plausible, however, is the use of networks to strengthen existing commercial relationships and lock in partners by increasing the costs of switching to new trading partners. Our review of the literature suggests that this latter tendency toward what have been called electronic hierarchies is more prevalent. This paper examines the theoretical rationales behind these competing effects and presents some evidence to show the conditions under which electronic marketplaces or electronic hierarchies are likely to prevail.", "num_citations": "251\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

Researchers estimate that people typically keep 10\u201320 important relationships out of the approximately 1000 individuals with whom they interact or can identify (eg, Fischer, 1982; Wellman, 1992). Friendships, in contrast to family relationships, are especially fragile and require active maintenance or they die (Canary & Stafford, 1994). Although family ties exist because of the accident of birth and are often maintained through obligation, friendship and romantic relationships are voluntary. They grow, decline, and end through concrete actions (Allan, 1979). In this chapter, we examine how young adults maintain friendships when faced with life events that threaten them, such as moving from high school to college. In particular, we examine the role that phone and computer communications play in maintaining these friendships as the parties move geographically apart.In Duck\u2019s analogy (1988), friendships need a regular investment of effort; otherwise, normal centripetal forces cause the friendship to come apart. In this view, people develop and maintain particular relationships by enacting them (ie, by carrying them out through regular exchanges of communication or social support; Duck, 1988).

This study focuses on the psychological and practical consequences of Facebook use following job loss. By pairing longitudinal surveys of Facebook users with logs of their online behavior, we examine how communication with different kinds of ties predicts improvements in stress, social support, bridging social capital, and whether they find new jobs. Losing a job is associated with increases in stress, while talking with strong ties is generally associated with improvements in stress and social support. Weak ties do not provide these benefits. Bridging social capital comes from both strong and weak ties. Surprisingly, individuals who have lost a job feel greater stress after talking with strong ties.

In addition, it says that if these modalities are used, equivocal tasks can be carried out with greater ease and better results. This article explores these hypotheses using multiple data sources: an interview study tracing the history of 55 published collaborative articles, two field experiments comparing the use of face-to-face communication and electronic mail as media for collaborative writing, and a laboratory experiment comparing voice and text as media for annotating documents.

But men and women are using it similarly to keep up with their siblings, their parents, and they use email comparably when communicating most often with a friend. The new technology seems to encourage fathers to communicate more regularly with sons and daughters who live away from home and with whom they did not otherwise keep up with very much, while wives fulfill gender role obligations to keep up with the in-laws by using email to revive these relationships.

Very few people are polymaths, with skills in all of these areas. Thus, both the scale and the scope involved in building large software applications demand group effort of some sort. The subfield of human-computer interaction (HCI) known as computersupported cooperative work (CSCW) attempts to build tools that will help groups of people to more effectively accomplish their work, as well as their learning and play. It also examines how groups incorporate these tools into their routines and the impact that various technologies have on group processes and outcomes. Computer-supported cooperative work, as a subfield, grew out of dissatisfaction with the individualistic emphasis in early research in HCI, with its overwhelming concern with single individuals using computers to perform", "num_citations": "130\n", "authors": ["1161"]}
{"title": "Interface design and multivariate analysis of UNIX command use\n", "abstract": " To understand how people interact with powerful computer systems, we analyzed, using several multivariate statistical analyses, the commands people use and the errors they made when performing office work with the UNIX operating system. The frequency of use across commands was very uneven. Users' most frequent commands were those that performed editing-like functions on text and other objects (eg, UNIX directories), those that returned orienting information to users, and those that helped to control and sequence other commands. People made mistakes frequently, and made them most, when they needed information about the command and file context in which they were working, and when they had to plan long sequences of commands without feedback. From these analyses we make several recommendations for a human-computer interface.", "num_citations": "129\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

The Machiavellianism of fathers and mothers was positively related to their children's success at deceiving others but not at seeing through others' attempts at deception. In addition, fathers' Machiavellianism was positively related to their children's Machiavellian beliefs. These data support a modeling hypothesis for the development of Machiavellianism. Unexpectedly, the children's own behaviors and beliefs were unrelated.

{"title": "Motivating environmentally sustainable behavior changes with a virtual polar bear\n", "abstract": " Personal choices and activities account directly for much of the energy consumption in the US with secondary impacts of those activities influencing an even larger proportion of energy consumption. Although there is a long history of investigation into motivators for energyconservation, it is still unclear how to encourage persistent behavior change, and technology has only recently been applied to the problem. We sought to learn if virtual pets could have a positive impact on real-world, environmentally responsible behavior. The polar bear is a powerful iconic symbol for many individuals, and its fate can be simply and directly connected to environmentally responsible behavior. Just as Tamagotchis evoked a powerful response from their owners, we hoped to use attachment to a virtual polar bear as a motivator for energy conservation. We ran a study exploring the impact of attachment on real-world actions. The results of our study suggest that an interactive virtual polar bear may increase environmentally responsible behaviors, especially when emotional attachment takes place.", "num_citations": "115\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

Consequences of deviance include driving off users and tarnishing the system's public image. We present an examination of these concepts in a popular online game, League of Legends. Using a large collection of game records and player-given feedback, we develop a metric, toxicity index, to identify deviant players. We then look at the effects of interacting with deviant players, including effects on retention. We find that toxic players have several significant predictive patterns, such as playing in more competitive game modes and playing with friends. We also show that toxic players drive away new players, but that experienced players are more resilient to deviant behavior. Based on our findings, we suggest methods to better identify and counteract the negative effects of deviance.", "num_citations": "114\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

However, the learning process often involves struggles with confusion, which may have an adverse effect on the course participation experience, leading to dropout along the way. In this paper, we quantify that effect. We describe a classification model using discussion forum behavior and clickstream data to automatically identify posts that express confusion. We then apply survival analysis to quantify the impact of confusion on student dropout. The results demonstrate that the more confusion students express or are exposed to, the lower the probability of their retention. Receiving support and resolution of confusion helps mitigate this effect. We explore the differential effects of confusion expressed in different contexts and related to different aspects of courses.

By mining 1980 Census data, we partially solve this problem. Only 1.6 percent of the work force worked at home as their primary place of employment in 1980, a percentage that had been declining since 1960. A decision to work at home seems based in part on an equilibrium between needs for employment flexibility and needs for earned income and, as a result, people who work at home come from social groups who would have the most trouble being employed outside the home, because of social or physical constraints: mothers, the elderly, the disabled, and people living in rural areas. Homeworkers earn substantially less than conventional workers.

Knowledge is also credited in creating sustainable competitive advantage (Grant 1996; Kogut and Zander 1992; Teece et al. 1997). Many companies have already deployed knowledge management systems (KMS) including knowledge repository to leverage their knowledge assets with the aid of advanced technologies. However, a critical challenge faced by organizations is to evaluate and maximize returns on their investments in KMS.Assessing the value of information technology (IT) investments has been a fundamental issue in the information systems (IS) discipline (Agarwal and Lucas 2005; Banker and Kauffman 2004; Barua et al. 1995; Kohli and Grover 2008; Melville et al. 2004).

Results using a panel design show that two processes for coordinating (use of shared cognition about the distribution of expertise within the team, and working together for a longer time period) improved coordination. Shared cognition seemed to compensate for low levels of communication and lack of working together.

This research traced the fate of 472,231 new online groups. By the end of a 3-month observation period, 57% of the groups had died, ceasing to post new content. Founders' human and social capital before the group was formed, the decisions they made when they created the group and their behavior in the group during its first week all predicted group survival. Many of the results suggest that founders create more successful groups if they have more resources (eg, more online friends) and opportunities for acquiring relevant skills (eg, more experience with online groups) and are more active in their group. However, founders who are too controlling seem to present a threat their groups.

{"title": "Fresh faces in the crowd: turnover, identity, and commitment in online groups\n", "abstract": " Turnover is commonplace in many online groups because of low barriers of entry and exit. In offline settings, turnover can have a negative impact because of reduced attachment to the group as an entity. However, in an online setting, turnover in terms of changes in the visible membership of a group may have a very different impact. Online only a limited amount of information about members and their activities is observable; in particular, it is easier to see the behavior of the subset of members who are active than the potentially larger set who are not. In this paper, we describe an experiment examining the influence of visible membership turnover on commitment to an online group. Our results suggest that increased turnover in an online group may increase social presence, creating perceptions of liveness, in turn leading to increased levels of participation in the group. However, this result holds primarily for groups\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "59\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

In this work, we develop new techniques to find roles in Wikipedia based on editors' low-level edit types and investigate how work contributed by people from different roles affect the article quality. To do this, we first built machine-learning models to automatically identify the edit categories associated with edits. We then applied a graphical model analogous to Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover the latent roles in editors' edit histories. Applying this technique revealed eight different roles editors play. Finally, we validated how our identified roles collaborate to improve the quality of articles. The results demonstrate that editors carrying on different roles contribute differently in terms of edit categories and articles in different quality stages need different types of editors. Implications for editor role identification and the validation of role contribution are discussed.", "num_citations": "57\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

However, current IS research on online communities has a limited view of these groups, treating them primarily as information repositories, where people participate by seeking or contributing knowledge. This paper argues that online communities are also social systems with which people form relationships and repeatedly interact over time. This paper proposes a relational model of online communities that emphasizes the social, bi-directional, and dynamic nature of the interactions in online communities and the way that these interactions build and maintain the relationship between individuals and the community. Hypotheses derived from the relational model are tested by examining the 22-month history of 28,869 newcomers who initially posted to 98 Usenet groups between May 15, 2003, and February 23, 2005. First, taking the newcomers\u2019 point of view, we examine how the community\u2019s response to their posts influences their subsequent participation in the community. Then, taking the community\u2019s point of view, we examine how the nature of individual members\u2019 participation in the community influences the community\u2019s willingness to interact with them. Consistent with the relational model, the results show that the social nature of interactions, including the social status of the repliers and the use of welcoming, inclusive language in community responses, facilitates the development of the relationship between newcomers and the community.

{"title": "The Neutered Computer.\n", "abstract": " It is widely acknowledged that men incline more to technology than do women, both at work and home (if not to the technologies associated with housework). Given that over their lifetime most people\u2019s welfare depends on their productivity at work, and because technology is an important basis for this productivity, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that technology provides men with a significant welfare advantage. At the most general level, a wide range of evidence indicates a strong relationship between technical innovation and productive potential (Gallie, 1994; Nickell & Bell, 1995; Machin, 1996). More specifically, there is evidence of a possible association between individual usage of technologies at work\u2014especially computers\u2014and both productivity and wages (Krueger, 1993; Green, 1998). Although this relationship has been disputed (diNardo & Pischke, 1997; Entorf & Kramarz, 1997), an inability or unwillingness to use computers might reduce an individual\u2019s scope for employment or for fully effective employment. How inevitable is this? Is the male advantage the result of a response to technology, whether innate or socialized, that is positive for men and negative for women, or is the issue more transitory and contingent than this? One strand of thought sees girls, generally considered to be closer to mothers than boys, as favoring caring and interconnectedness over competition and aggression. 1 This might ultimately feed into different responses to technology (Turkle, 1998).

Many such questions can be raised with regard to new technology\u2019s impact on social life, with much of the intellectual discussion summarized in the distinction between utopian and dystopian views. The utopian view sees new technology like the Internet as improving the quality of our social lives, in contrast to the dystopian view which raises serious concerns about decreasing social contacts, loneliness, and the disintegration of family life. With more and more empirical research studies becoming available, the strongest of these hopes and fears have already had to be modified. Ideologically-driven discourse has given way to the more sober language of researchers, who have tested the effects of information technology (IT) in a wide variety of social contexts such as child\u2013parent relations, contacts with family and friends, and interactions with colleagues in the workplace. Research also admitted the possibility of there being no notable new effects of IT.This chapter examines the way in which new IT, and in particular the Internet, has affected peoples\u2019 time spent on social contacts and compares these results with the effects on other ways of spending time.

This paper examines how initial topical focus influences communities' ability to attract a critical mass. When starting an online community, organizers need to define its initial scope. Topically narrow communities will probably attract a homogeneous group of interested in its content and compatible with each other. However, they are likely to attract fewer members than a diverse one because they offer only a subset of the topics. This paper reports an empirical analysis of longitudinal data collected from Twitter, where each new Twitter poster is considered the seed of a potential social collection. Users who focus the topics of their early tweets more narrowly ultimately attract more followers with more ties among them.

To do so, they generally need to reveal private information about themselves and in many support sites, they can do this in public or private channels. However, we know little about how the publicness of the channels in health support groups influence the amount of self-disclosure people provide. Our work examines the extent members self-disclose in the private and public channels of an online cancer support group.

In contrast to findings from non-health-related sites, our results show that people generally self-disclose more in the public channel than the private one and are especially likely to reveal their negative thoughts and feelings publicly.

In many of the countries in Europe, North America, and Asia, the majority of individuals and households are using personal computers, the Internet, and mobile telephones. In the United States, this equipment is often referred to as information technology. In Europe, the phrase \u201cinformation and communication technologies\u201d is more commonly used and is abbreviated to ICTs. This book is about the potential effect of these new technologies, as they enter our homes and our daily lives, to change the range of activities we pursue, the way we perform old activities, our relationships with other people, and our personal and economic welfare. But will the new ICTs have a significant social effect, and if they do, will the change be positive? This book contributes to the investigations needed to answer these questions. Toward the end of his book The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, Daniel Bell (1973) argues that before the industrial revolution, humankind confronted nature; through the industrial revolution, we confronted a sort of \u201cfabricated nature.\u201d However, the \u201cpost-industrial society is essentially a game between persons\u201d(p. 488). In the new knowledge society, there is at one level simply more social interaction, but at another level, we also face new social challenges.

Project Massive was created to survey MMP players about their play experience, social experience, and communication tool usage both inside and outside of their gaming environments. 1852 MMP players have completed the online Project Massive survey, reporting on their play patterns, commitment to their player organizations, and personality traits like sociability and extraversion. The primary focus of Project Massive has been on the player groups that form in MMPs. Most MMPs support and attempt to foster group formation of some kind or another among their players. These formal player groups, often called guilds, can be as persistent as the digital worlds in which they exist. We have found that players who are highly committed to their guilds spend significantly more time in-game than do moderately committed guild members and solo (non-guild) players. Enhancing a player's commitment to their guild can translate into extending their commitment to the game world. In turn, this may result in longer subscriptions and increased revenue for the game's creators. This research is important because there has not been substantial research into the traits and practices of the more successful player organizations that are able to sustain committed bodies of members. Project Massive has investigated how these groups develop, organize, communicate, and operate across a number of independent game worlds.

Though geographic distance can inhibit enactment, telecommunication technologies (eg, phone, email, instant messaging) are increasingly being used to maintain relationships over long distances. In this paper, we examine role that these technologies play in maintaining friendships. Taking advantage of a natural situation in which friends are at risk, we follow high school students in their transition to college. When students move away from home, they reduce both their communication with their old high school friends and their sense of psychological connection to them. Longitudinal analysis shows that communication slows the decline in psychological closeness, but the reverse does not happen. Communicating by computer through email and instant messaging seems to be the telecommunications technologies that are especially useful for maintaining friendships among these student. The utility of these technologies may not stem from their intrinsic features, like media richness, but from arbitrary pricing decisions. Unlike the telephone, which costs more when talking longer to someone farther away, pricing for the computer mediated communication technologies does not depend upon either the length of a message or the distance it must travel.

The failure of many collaborative technologies is due, in part, to a limited understanding of how groups coordinate in collocated environments and how the coordination mechanisms of face-to-face collaboration are impacted by technology. The major goal of this thesis is to address this deficiency by building a theoretical understanding of the role that shared visual information plays in supporting group communication and performance during task-oriented collaboration. This understanding is developed over three major stages:(1) the development of a paradigm and a series of empirical studies that decompose the features of shared visual information and task structure and explore their interactions in detail,(2) the development and application of a methodology for describing the sequential structure of how visible actions support the understanding of discourse, and (3) the development of a computational model of discourse to further our theoretical understanding of the ways in which shared visual information serves communication in task-oriented collaborative discourse.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

Yet conversations often fail: Forty percent of potential thread-starting messages in Usenet groups receive no response. When this happens, those who are trying to get information, support, or discussion from a group receive no benefit from their efforts. This paper presents a multi-method series of studies into community responsiveness to two rhetorical strategies: self-disclosing introductions and making requests. Introductions signal legitimacy and commitment, and requests reduce community effort by making clear what is needed. An analysis of a longitudinal sample of 40,931 messages from 99 Usenet groups shows that introductions referencing lurking and a personal connection to the topic of discussion increase the likelihood of getting a reply. So does making requests. Machine learning detects introductions and requests automatically within the text. A pair of experiments in which introductions and requests are added or removed from previously posted messages and reposted to Usenet groups shows that introductions referencing the group history cause an increase in reply counts, but requests do not.

Results indicate that such displays can be useful in coordinating communication, but only when the interrupter has motivation to use the display. Our results also indicate that the attentional demand of the awareness displays themselves need to be taken into consideration, because too much detail may distract the person viewing the display from their primary task. In this study, participants spent significantly more time looking at the most detailed-filled displays and these displays harmed their task performance.

The best predictor of which medium is used is the extent to which the medium can put people into contact with their important communication partners.

{"title": "Mining and Predicting Temporal Patterns in the Quality Evolution of Wikipedia Articles.\n", "abstract": " Online open collaboration systems like Wikipedia are complex adaptive systems within which large numbers of individual agents and artifacts interact and co-evolve over time. A key issue in these systems is the quality of the co-created artifacts and the processes through which high-quality artifacts are produced. In this paper, we took a dynamic approach to uncover common patterns in the temporal evolution of 6,057 Wikipedia articles in the domains of roads, films, and battles. Using Dynamic Time Warping, an advanced time-series clustering method, we identified three distinctive growth patterns, namely, stalled, plateaued, and sustained. Multinomial logistic regressions to predict these different clusters suggest that the path that an article follows is determined by both its inherent attributes, such as topic importance, and the contribution and coordination of editors who collaborated on the article. Our results also suggest that different factors matter at different stages of an article\u2019s life cycle.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1161"]}

To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we use it to examine the effects of three types of discussion moderation in conversation-based communities: no moderation, in which all members are exposed to all messages, community-level moderation, in which off-topic messages are deleted for everyone in the group, and personalized moderation, in which people see different messages based on their interests. Our results suggest that personalized moderation outperforms the others in increasing members\u2019 contribution and commitment, especially in topically broad communities and those with high message volume. In comparison, community-level moderation increases commitment but not contribution. Our results also reveal a critical trade-off between informational and relational benefits.

Analyses show that social language used by human agents is associated with greater users' responsiveness and task completion. The second component of the research is the construction of a conversational agent model capable of injecting social language into an agent's responses while still preserving content. The model uses a sequence-to-sequence deep learning architecture, extended with a social language understanding element.

These results demonstrate the value of a shared visual work space, but raise questions about the ability of current video communication technology for implementing it.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1161"]}
