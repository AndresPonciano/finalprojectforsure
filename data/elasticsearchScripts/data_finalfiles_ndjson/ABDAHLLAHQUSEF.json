{"title": "A New e-Tendering Model For Fully Automated Tendering Process\n", "abstract": " Along with the revolution in information technology solutions and the wide replacement of the legacy manual procedures with the automated and digital workflow procedures, many electronic solutions have been developed and used to digitize the supply chain processes and as one of the main process in the supply chain, it is highly demanded nowadays to perform the procurement processes in the enterprises using e-procurement system. As part of e-Procurement, this paper emphasizes the importance of leveraging the tendering process in an enterprise to be fully electronic by adopting the e-Tendering approach. This research proposes a new model for e-Tendering which enables an enterprise to conduct a fully automated web-based tendering process. The proposed model is a new conceptual model of fully automated, digital and web-based tendering solution that is covering all steps of the tendering process\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2235"]}
{"title": "Automatic Recovery of Unit Tests after Code Refactoring\n", "abstract": " Unit testing allows developers to refactor their code confidently, these tests act as a safety net against producing bugs and provide immediate feedback during the refactoring process and furthermore help developers overcome the fear of change. When performing refactoring, the design of code is changed or restructured according to a predefined plan, after refactoring is applied, the alignment between source code and its corresponding unit tests could be broken which creates a problem that needs to be solved.This paper introduces an approach in which code refactoring can maintain the integrity of the previous unit tests; the tool called GreenRef demonstrates this work. This tool supports an automatic recovery for the unit tests after performing of three particular refactoring types for Java programming language: Rename Method, Add Parameter and Remove Parameter.The achieved results indicate that GreenRef\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2235"]}

This chapter introduces a new healthcare IT cloud model called HealthGate Cloud (HGC), which is specially designed as a central repository for patients' EHRs. The proposed model provides a technical and business framework for a centralized enterprise healthcare information system and data sharing between all participated healthcare providers in the country or region, which makes them all as if they are one big hospital having one single repository and database for all patients' medical records. It can be used by any HA in any country\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2235"]}
{"title": "Power of Using Regular Expression Patterns in Software Coding Standards Quality Control\n", "abstract": " The regular expression is a method to describe strings that conform to a pattern. The need to use regular expressions arise to deal with strings which have a specific pattern such as a user input string, formatted data, and computer programs code elements. In this paper, the authors intend to establish a framework that aims to improve the quality control process to prove that the source code meets standards using a regular expressions. The framework extracts the code from the files then determines if the written code is following the company's own coding standards. The proposed framework covers the naming convention standards, data types utilizations, undesired programming language commands and keywords, hardcoded literals usage, and as well as the business dictionary tags compliance. The short achieved results shows the effectiveness of regular expressions to figure out the compliance of the source\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2235"]}
{"title": "Visualization of test-to-code relations to detect problems of unit tests\n", "abstract": " Visualization of test information can be a means of providing an understanding of test-code relations which, in turn, is essential for other activities in SDLC such as: maintenance, software evolution, refactoring, etc. To our best knowledge, less research have specifically addressed the visualization of test-code relation and its importance in many tasks during software development. This paper is a modest contribution to draw attention to visualization of test-code relations and in particular visualizing of test-to-code traceability links. From the outcome of our investigation it has been demonstrated that visualizing of test-related metrics has been received rather interest of researchers; while in turn, little attention has been paid to visualizing of test to code traceability links. However, several practical questions emerged which can be investigated as the next step of our research, thus further research of visualization of test-to-code traceability links area is highly needed to address these questions.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2235"]}

{"title": "Project Manager Roles in Software Information Systems: Case Studies from Jordan\n", "abstract": " In the traditional software development life cycle (SDLC), the project management theory assumes the involvement of project manager in every phase of the project with all parties. However, this will not be always possible because of the variation of software projects based on the project size (small, medium, and enterprise), which affects the project constraints of cost, time, and scope. In this paper, we take real-life case studies of successful projects in Jordan to be classified based on many factors, and then, we define the responsibilities of the project managers in every class based on those case studies.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2235"]}

{"title": "An Eclipse plug-in for Test-to-Code Traceability Recovery\n", "abstract": " Developers write and maintain unit tests continually in order to reflect changes in the production code and maintain an effective regression test suite. In addition, during refactoring developers must ensure that all unit tests continue to pass, so unit tests often need to be refactored together with the source code. Traceability links between application code and respective unit tests are extremely useful to preserving consistency during refactoring. Unfortunately, support for identifying and maintaining traceability links between unit tests and tested classes in contemporary software engineering environments and tools is not satisfactory. This paper presents SCOTCH (Slicing and COupling based Test to Code trace Hunter), a tool implemented as an Eclipse plug-in that uses dynamic slicing and conceptual coupling to automatically establish the traceability links between unit tests and application code. The evaluation of SCOTCH on several software systems highlights its usefulness as a feature within a software development environment.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["2235"]}

{"title": "Recovering Test-To-Code Traceability Using Slicing and Textual Analysis\u2013Technical Report\u2013\n", "abstract": " In order to compare the different test-to-code traceability recovery techniques we had to create an oracle providing the correct set of tested classes for each JUnit test involved in our experimentation. To create the required oracle, three Ph. D. students from the University of Salerno manually identified the links between the JUnit tests and the tested classes for the five systems. The students individually analyzed the code. To avoid bias, students were not aware of the experimental goals or the experimental recovery methods. Once students retrieved the tested classes, they performed an open-discussion with the researchers to solve conflicts and reach a consensus on the traceability links identified. In this open discussion the researchers limited their role to moderators, making sure that the students reached a consensus for all the JUnit tests without introducing any bias. The links retrieved by each of the three students, as well as a table summarizing inter-evaluator agreement for each of the 358 tests composing our oracle are provided in the following.
