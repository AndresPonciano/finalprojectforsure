{"title": "Patient autonomy and disclosure of material information about hospital-acquired infections\n", "abstract": " Hospital-acquired infections are nowadays a major health care problem worldwide. The morbidity and mortality associated with them are highest in intensive care units, but their effects are identifiable in virtually any medical department. Information about hospital-acquired infections, especially about their preventive measures, are rarely presented nowadays in a correct fashion to patients. This article aims to present, in a structured manner, the theoretical and practical aspects related to disclosure of hospital-acquired infections\u2013related information to patients and its importance in preventing their spread. We will analyze both the conceptual framework for disclosing medical information related to nosocomial infections (autonomy, veracity, social justice, the principle of double effect, the precautionary principle, and nonmaleficence) and the practicalities regarding the disclosure of proper information to patients.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2174"]}

Consequently, the development of machine vision systems in the industry has been studied extensively. The provision of a high-level quality control system based on vision inspection in production lines is an important issue. It not only can increase the efficiency, but also derives the necessary tools to gather information about technical errors and faults in the target system. In this paper, we focus on the vision inspection of bottle caps in drink factories using convolutional neural networks. There are different cap encapsulation statuses which are classified as Normal Cap, Unfixed Cap, and No Cap. According to these classes, we can make a decision between either acceptance or rejection of a given bottle.

{"title": "Longitudinal Evaluation of Software Quality Metrics in Open-Source Applications.\n", "abstract": " Assessment of software quality remains the focus of important research efforts, with several proposed quality models and assessment methodologies. ISO 25010 describes software quality in terms of characteristics such as reliability, security or maintainability. In turn, these characteristics can be evaluated in terms of software metric values, establishing a relation between software metrics and quality. However, a general metric-based model for software quality does not yet exist. The diversity of software applications, metric definitions and differences between proposed quality models all contribute to this. Our paper proposes a longitudinal evaluation of the metric values and their relations in the context of three complex, open-source applications. We cover the entire 18 year development history of the targeted applications. We explore typical values for metrics associated with software product quality and explore their evolution in the context of software development. We identify dependant metrics and explore the effect class size has on the strength of dependencies. At each step, we compare the obtained results with relevant related work in order to contribute to a growing pool of evidence towards our goal-a metric-based evaluation of software quality characteristics.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["2174"]}

In this paper we present our ongoing efforts in the development of a wireless sensor network based cyber-physical system which aims to prevent hospital infections by increasing compliance to established hygiene guidelines. The solution, currently developed under European Union funding integrates a network of sensors for monitoring clinical workflows and ambient conditions, a workflow engine that executes encoded workflow instances and monitoring software that provides real-time information in case of infection risk detection. As a motivating example, we employ the workflow in the general practitioner's office in order to comprehensively present types of sensors and their positioning in the monitored location.

{"title": "Preventing hospital acquired infections through a workflow-based cyber-physical system\n", "abstract": " Hospital acquired infections (HAI) are infections acquired within the hospital from healthcare workers, patients or from the environment, but which have no connection to the initial reason for the patient's hospital admission. HAI are a serious world-wide problem, leading to an increase in mortality rates, duration of hospitalisation as well as significant economic burden on hospitals. Although clear preventive guidelines exist, studies show that compliance to them is frequently poor. This paper details the software perspective for an innovative, business process software based cyber-physical system that will be implemented as part of a European Union-funded research project. The system is composed of a network of sensors mounted in different sites around the hospital, a series of wearables used by the healthcare workers and a server side workflow engine. For better understanding, we describe the system through the lens of a single, simple clinical workflow that is responsible for a significant portion of all hospital infections. The goal is that when completed, the system will be configurable in the sense of facilitating the creation and automated monitoring of those clinical workflows that when combined, account for over 90\\% of hospital infections.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2174"]}

The samples were originated from two countries: Romania (50) and France (53), having as floral origins: acacia, linden, honeydew, colza, galium verum, coriander, sunflower, thyme, raspberry, lavender and chestnut. The ANNs were built on the isotope and elemental content of the investigated honey samples. This approach conducted to the development of a prediction model for geographical recognition with an accuracy of 96%. Alongside this work, distinct models were developed and tested, with the aim of identifying the most suitable configurations for this application. In this regard, improvements have been continuously performed; the most important of them consisted in overcoming the unwanted phenomenon of over-fitting, observed for the training data set. This was achieved by identifying appropriate values for the number of iterations over the training data and for the size and number of the hidden layers and by introducing of a dropout layer in the configuration of the neural structure.

Current expectation is that advances in technology will supplement the human workforce required for older adult care, improve their quality of life and decrease healthcare expenditure. The proposed approach is implemented in the form of a configurable cyber-physical system that enables indoor localization and monitoring of older adults living at home or in residential buildings. Hardware consists of custom developed luminaires with sensing, communication and processing capabilities. They replace the existing lighting infrastructure, do not look out of place and are cost effective. The luminaires record the strength of a Bluetooth signal emitted by a wearable device equipped by the monitored user. The system's software server uses trilateration to calculate the person's location based on known luminaire placement and recorded signal strengths. However, multipath fading caused by the presence of walls, furniture and other objects introduces localisation errors.
