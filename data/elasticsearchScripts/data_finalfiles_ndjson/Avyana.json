Under the circumstances, Caldwell has no reservation in listing him as the senior author. It is the best way of recognizing his contribution. At the same time, both authors must acknowledge their debt to the Nebraska State Histori-cal Society. We have drawn heavily upon their collections and their good will.

Early explorers initially believed the earthlodge homes of Plains village peoples were made entirely of earth. Actually, however, earthlodges are timber-frame structures, with the frame covered by successive layers of willows, grass, and earth, and with a tunnel-like entryway and a smoke hole in the center of the roof. The products of nearly a millennium of engineering development, historic period lodges were massively built. With diameters up to 60 feet across, they comprise the largest and most complex artifacts built on the Plains until the 20th century. Sheltering nuclear or extended families and their possessions\u2014beds, stored food and clothing, weapons, sweatlodges, and even livestock\u2014they shaped Plains villagers' lives both physically and symbolically. This collection of papers explores current research in the ethnography and archaeology of Plains earthlodges, considering a variety of Plains tribes, including the Mandan, Hidatsa, Cheyenne, and their late prehistoric period predecessors. Acknowledged experts in the field discuss topics including lodge construction, architecture, maintenance, deterioration, and lifespan; the ritual practices performed in them; their associations with craft traditions, medicine lodges, and the Sun Dance; their gender symbolism; and their geophysical signatures. With technological advances allowing an ever greater recognition of archaeological evidence in situ, future earthlodge research will yield even more information on their owners and residents.

The Nebraska Phase has been described in detail in a manuscript Warren Caldwell and I wrote a number of years ago which will be published soon by the Laboratory of Anthropology at the University of Nebraska. The Nebraska Phase was in existence from about AD1050 to 1425; earlier and later radiocarbon dates appear to be the result of the counting statistic, contamination, fractionation, and variations in the level of atmospheric C-14. During this time span, two very slightly different territorial units can be recognized in eastern Nebraska-a series of sites in the bluffs along the Missouri River, which span the full time range of the phase from AD 1050 to 1425, and another set of sites along streams tributary to the Missouri River from the west, which date between A. D. 1250 and 1425 (Figures 1 and 2). The sites along the tributary streams thus occur only during the second half of the phase.

In southwest Nebraska, a stretch of Medicine Creek approximately 20 kilometers long holds a remarkable concentration of both late Paleoindian and late prehistoric sites. Unlike several nearby similar and parallel streams that drain the divide between the Platte and Republican Rivers, Medicine Creek has undergone 70 years of archaeological excavations that reveal a long occupation by North America's earliest inhabitants. Donna Roper has collected the written research in this volume that originated in a conference celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 1947 River Basin Survey. In addition to 12 chapters reviewing the long history of archaeological investigations at Medicine Creek, the volume contains recent analyses of and new perspectives on old sites and old data. Two of the sites discussed are considered for pre-Clovis status because they show evidence of human modification of mammoth faunal remains in the late Pleistocene Age. Studies of later occupation of Upper Republican phase sites yield information on the lifeways of Plains village people. Presented by major investigators at Medicine Creek, the contributions are a balanced blend of the historical research and the current state-of-the-art work and analysis. Roper's comprehensive look at the archaeology, paleontology, and geomorphology at Medicine Creek gives scientists and amateurs a full assessment of a site that has taught us much about the North American continent and its early people.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1960"]}

{"title": "Middle Ceramic period earthlodges as the products of craft traditions\n", "abstract": " Crom the beginning of archaeological research on the houses of the Middle T'Ceramic period (AD 1000-1400) in the Central Plains, the earthlodges of the historic village peoples were used both explicitly and tacitly as interpretive models. Thus, when Robert F. Gilder (1907) initiated excavation of the houses of the Nebraska phase early in the twentieth century, he assumed that the structures were circular and never bothered to determine their actual shape. It took the first professional archaeology in the region, done by Frederick Sterns (1915), to demonstrate that the houses were square. Similarly, when WPA archaeologists began excavating similar sites in Iowa, they first found what appeared to be circular remains of houses, and only after AT Hill showed them a better excavation method were they able to report square structures (Hotopp 1978). Still later, W. Raymond Wood (1952) used infor-mation on historic Hidatsa earthlodges to interpret variations in the number of center posts in Nebraska phase lodges. This reliance on the historic lodges is fraught with difficulties. To begin with, the number of detailed descriptions of how the historic lodges were built is quite meager. Gilbert Wilson's (1934) monograph on the Hidatsa earthlodge is the only relatively complete account, reported by Buffalobird Woman, who owned the sacred knowledge required to be a Hidatsa architect.

It is one of the two least understood segments of the route, the other being the segment from the Mexican border north to the Zuni pueblos. The reason for focusing on Texas is that, if we can resolve this most difficult section, we will have demon-strated the feasibility of tracing the whole. My effort has involved review of the primary documents, old maps and aerial photos, and accounts of later expeditions across the same region. It also has involved two field expeditions. The first, including Waldo, Mildred, and Wally Wedel and Jack Hughes, was funded by the Don and Sybil Harrington-Amarillo Area Founda-tion, while the second was supported by Wichita State University. The basic procedure I have tried to follow is to attempt to elimi-nate the wrong interpretations of the route and to see what is left at the end of the process. This is very different from trying to prove a single favored hypothesis and in the long run is far more effective.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1960"]}
{"title": "Who were the Plains Indian berdaches?\n", "abstract": " The standard anthropological view of berdaches is that they were men who took up their society 1 s version of the woman!~ role by choice -- male homosexuals who adopted women's dress and women's work without any loss of respect from their respect~ve communities. There is very little in the ethnohistoric and ethnological literature to support this point of view, however. The scattered and varied references to berdaches among the Plains Indians reflect a more complex situation. Berdaches may not always have been homosexuals, sometimes did not wear women's clothing, performed roles that were not identical to women's roles, and, in at least some tribes, appear to have inherited their status. It is probably misleading to assess Plains Indian berdache~ in terms of the sex role and sexual identity variations recognized in our own society. The iqeas and models implied by the terms homosexual, transvestite, and transsexual are not easily applied cross culturally. The processes of acquisition of sexual identity in Plains Indian societies were probably different enough from those in our own society (which are still poorly understood) to render analysis of them unrewarding at this time.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1960"]}
{"title": "Mapping with an electronic calculator\n", "abstract": " Compiling an accurate and detailed map of an archaeological site is one of the more time-consuming and hence expensive phases of archaeological work. This paper presents some techniques developed at Wichita State University that combine the use of an optical transit and a hand-held electronic calculator to provide rapid and error-free methods for compiling detailed archaeological maps. The process used in constructing the maps can be reversed to enable the archaeologist to layout test squares without first laying a grid of stakes and string over the site.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1960"]}
{"title": "Man and Environment in Northeastern Kansas: The Hillsdale Lake Project. Volume 5.\n", "abstract": " This study investigated archeological and architectural sites at the Hillsdale Lake project in eastern Kansas. Investigation was directed toward the recovery of data pertinent to the identification of local cultures and time periods, the development of settlement patterns for each culture, the reconstruction of paleo-environments, and the developmemt of models of ecological adaption for cultural systems through time. This report provides new information on Nebo Hill trade relationships, the definition of the Hertha Phase a Late Woodland manifestation and on the Pomona focus, Steed-Kisker complex and Great Bend Aspect. The architectural study focused on the development of a model describing the effects of the areas environment on the vernacular architecture and the chronology of types of structures in the project area. In addition, site types were cataloged.
