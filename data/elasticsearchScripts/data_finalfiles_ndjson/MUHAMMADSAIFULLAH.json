{"title": "The art of software testing\n", "abstract": " The classic, landmark work on software testing The hardware and software of computing have changed markedly in the three decades since the first edition of The Art of Software Testing, but this book's powerful underlying analysis has stood the test of time. Whereas most books on software testing target particular development techniques, languages, or testing methods, The Art of Software Testing, Third Edition provides a brief but powerful and comprehensive presentation of time-proven software testing approaches. If your software development project is mission critical, this book is an investment that will pay for itself with the first bug you find. The new Third Edition explains how to apply the book's classic principles to today's hot topics including: Testing apps for iPhones, iPads, BlackBerrys, Androids, and other mobile devices Collaborative (user) programming and testing Testing for Internet applications, e-commerce, and agile programming environments Whether you're a student looking for a testing guide you'll use for the rest of your career, or an IT manager overseeing a software development team, The Art of Software Testing, Third Edition is an expensive book that will pay for itself many times over.", "num_citations": "7608\n", "authors": ["305"]}
{"title": "Software testing techniques\n", "abstract": " Software Testing Techniques, 2nd Edition is the first book-length work that explicitly addresses the idea that design for testability is as important as testing itself not just by saying that testability is a desirable goal, but by showing the reader how it to do it. Every chapter has testability guidelines that illustrate how the technique discussed in the chapter can be used to make software more easily tested and therefore more reliable and maintainable. Application of all techniques to unit, integration, maintenance, and system testing are discussed throughout this book. As a self-study text, as a classroom text, as a working reference, it is a book that no programmer, independent software tester, software engineer, testing theorist, system designer, or software project manager can be without.", "num_citations": "4852\n", "authors": ["305"]}
