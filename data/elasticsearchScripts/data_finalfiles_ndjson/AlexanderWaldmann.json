{"title": "The MIT AgeLab n-back: a multi-modal android application implementation\n", "abstract": " This paper briefly describes the background of the MIT AgeLab implementation of a delayed digit recall or n-back task, and the capabilities of an android application developed to implement a multi-modal version. The MIT AgeLab n-back task is a well-established methodology for inducing graded levels of cognitive workload. It has been adopted for broad use as a multi-modal surrogate demand and calibration task, and recently introduced as a driver and pedestrian distraction education tool.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["2283"]}
