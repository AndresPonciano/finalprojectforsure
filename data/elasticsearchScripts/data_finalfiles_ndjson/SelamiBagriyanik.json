{"title": "Automated COSMIC Function Point measurement using a requirements engineering ontology\n", "abstract": " ContextThere are two interrelated difficulties in requirements engineering processes. First, free-format modelling practices in requirements engineering activities may lead to low quality artefacts and productivity problems. Second, the COSMIC Function Point Method is not yet widespread in the software industry because applying measurement rules to imprecise and ambiguous textual requirements is difficult and requires additional human measurement effort. This challenge is common to all functional size measurement methods.ObjectiveIn this study, alternative solutions have been investigated to address these two difficulties. Information created during the requirements engineering process is formalized as an ontology that also becomes a convenient model for transforming requirements into COSMIC Function Point Method concepts.MethodA method is proposed to automatically measure the functional size of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2009"]}

All phases of application development phases are in our scope including but not limited to elicitation, requirements analysis, design, software implementation, version control management, unit/functional/regression/automated/performance/stress test, release management, application log monitoring, application usage monitoring, user complaint management, security and compliance management and software problem management. Methods: We use a systematic literature review methodology used in Software Engineering studies to find and analyse the related studies published from January 2010 to October 2015. We synthesize the quantitative and qualitative outputs of selected papers and report the results. Findings and Results: In general, there are scarce studies in the literature. However there are relatively more papers regarding some areas such as Software Quality, Development, Project Management and Human Computer Interaction. However research in some fields such as Deployment, Requirements Engineering, Release Management and Mobile Applications were relatively less. Conclusions & Recommendations: More studies are required to identify the use cases, data attributes, measurements, platform requirements especially in the fields which are identified as having lack of study. A holistic big data perspective is needed to support software engineering ecosystems in large and complex enterprises.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["2009"]}
{"title": "Personal learning environments: A Big Data perspective\n", "abstract": " Problem Statement: Traditional instructional learning based platforms (eg, Learning Management Systems) and master \u00e2\u20ac\u201capprentice model is not sufficient for the companies and their human capital anymore. Employees should lead their vocational competence in a connected, fast changing world. It is a great challenge for enterprises and people to find relevant learning resources in an unstructured, scattered, distributed, and overwhelmingly large amount of information ocean and un-learn/learn continuously in this environment. Purpose of Study: Personal Learning Environments enhanced with Big Data analysis opportunities and emerging technologies seem a solution for the aforementioned problem. This study aims to propose a preliminary Personal Learning Environment Architecture leveraging Big Data possibilities. Methods: Systematic literature review method is used to review the literature reviews including the research of Big Data in education and personal learning environments. Findings and Results: Based on the literature knowledge captured, a preliminary personal learning environment architecture is synthesized and proposed. Conclusions and Recommendations: Proposed preliminary architecture seems to address basic usecases in the literature. However a detailed data gathering should be conducted in a large enterprise using more sophisticated technics such as field surveys, descriptive analytics and case studies. Although the architecture is promising for the personal learning environments, it needs systematic validation with more data both technologically and andragogically.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2009"]}
