This error is proportional to the amount of bit transitions in transmitted packets. In applications that present a large number of packets exchange, the error is propagated, significantly affecting the mapping results. This paper proposes a high-level application model that captures the traffic effect and uses it to describe the behavior of applications.

A considerable number of NoC proposals are available, focusing on different sets of optimization aspects, related to specific classes of applications. Each such application employs a NoC as part of its underlying implementation infrastructure. Many of the mentioned optimization aspects target results such as Quality of Service (QoS) achievement and/or power consumption reduction.

Although the availability of NoC structures is already rather ample, some design choices are at base of many, if not most, NoC proposals. These include the use of wormhole packet switching and virtual channels. This work pledges against this practice. It discusses trade-offs of using circuit or packet switching, arguing in favor the use of the former with fixed size packets (cells). Quantitative data supports the argumentation. Also, the work proposes and justifies replacing the use of virtual channels by replicated channels, based on the abundance of wires in current and expected deep sub-micron technologies.

Data messages transport data exchanged between tasks at the application layer. In computational systems, several other messages do not belong directly to the application layer. Those messages called control messages are related to the system management. The state-of-the-art shows a grow in the number of proposals employing dedicated NoC architectures for control messages. Dedicated NoCs are employed for, e.g., cache management, security, resource allocation, fault-tolerance, circuit switching, and system monitoring. A common limitation of these proposals is specialization. For example, it is not possible to use a dedicated NoC designed for cache coherence protocols to fault tolerance purposes.

{"title": "Buffer sizing for multimedia flows in packet-switching NoCs\n", "abstract": " Wormhole packet switching, used in many NoC designs, introduces jitter. This may produce violations of application deadlines. Several works in the literature propose stream workload models, and techniques for buffer sizing. These works do not consider the concurrency between different flows, or the NoC model is too abstract, masking the jitter introduced by data packaging and router processing. One technique to deal with jitter is to introduce a decoupling buffer (D-buffer) on the target IP. This buffer receives data from the NoC with jitter, while the target IP consumes data from this buffer at the application rate, without jitter. Two problems must be solved to implement D-buffers:(i) which size must the buffer have?(ii) how much time should be expected before data consumption starts (threshold)? This work proposes a general method to define D-buffer size and threshold, considering the influence of packaging, arbitration, routing and concurrency between flows. A traffic model for stream applications is detailed and used to characterize jitter sources in wormhole packet switching. Experimental results demonstrate the impact on multimedia flows with fixed and variable packet sizes (from real traffic traces). Simple traffic models employing constant frame sizes result in small D-buffers. On the other hand, employing multimedia frames from application traces (ie real application data) increases buffer size and threshold while still suppressing jitter. Another parameter analyzed in the paper is the percentage of deadline violations as a function of D-buffer size. The method guarantees throughput with no deadline violation and does not modify the NoC\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["519"]}

The new curriculum significantly enhanced the hardware contents taught with regard to the previous one. Also, the hardware courses track in the curriculum was designed to expose students very early to hardware design using mostly professional tools. The reasoning to do so is exposed in detail in [1]. The basic idea is to propose a processor implementation as practical work to be developed along several semesters. First, the students have to produce a processor description from a detailed specification, implementing it in a hardware description language (currently, VHDL). Validation of their design is achieved by functional simulation. This happens in the third semester of the curriculum. A following course requires the students to start from their previous semester design and transform their implementation into a pipelined processor with the same architecture (register bank, instruction set, etc.). In a subsequent course, input-output capabilities and memory hierarchy considerations are added to the same design.Every semester, a different processor specification is prepared. Specifications differ from one another in some aspects, the main ones being the requirement of unified memory or Harvard organization and obviously instruction set. However, all processors share common characteristics of being load-store, 16-bit RISC-like architectures, with a bank of 16 16-bit registers, and the instruction word length being fixed at 16 bits.

{"title": "A message-level monitoring protocol for QoS flows in NoCs\n", "abstract": " This work proposes a traffic monitoring scheme to be applied to NoCs. Current schemes transmit monitoring traffic to one or more MSA (Monitoring Service Access Point), and such MSAs are responsible to take some action, as task migration and fault detection. The proposed monitoring method is flow-oriented, i.e, it works at the message-level, and traffic congestion is evaluated all along the source-target path. It can be applied to different adaptation methods as adaptive routing, task migration and dynamic task mapping. Traffic information of QoS flows is stored in tables located at each router. Traffic initiators indicate the routers of the QoS flow path that should be monitored. MSAs are placed in targets of QoS traffic, and notify to the traffic source the occurrence of congestion. DATA packets are used to transmit both application data and monitoring traffic. Presented results evaluate the method in terms of area\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["519"]}
{"title": "Buffer sizing for QoS flows in wormhole packet switching NoCs\n", "abstract": " Networks on chip (NoCs) are communication infrastructures that offer parallelism and scalability. Most NoC designs employ wormhole packet switching, since this switching mode optimizes the use of NoC resources. However, this mode may introduce jitter, possibly producing packet loss, due to the violation of temporal QoS constraints. One technique to deal with jitter is to introduce a decoupling buffer (D-buffer) on the target IP. This buffer receives data from the NoC with jitter, while the target IP consumes data from this buffer at the application rate, without jitter. Two problems must be solved to implement D-buffers:(i) which size must the buffer have?(ii) how much buffer space should be filled before data consumption starts (threshold)? This work proposes a general method to define D-buffer size and threshold, considering the influence of packaging, arbitration, routing and concurrency between flows.

{"title": "A cost-effective test flow for homogeneous network-on-chip\n", "abstract": " Network-on-Chip (NoC)[2] has recently emerged as an alternative communication architecture for complex system chips. Different aspects regarding NoC design have been studied in the literature. In a NoC-based system, cores communicate with each other sending and receiving packets, like in a computer network. The main components of the NoC are routers. For further details on NoC refer to [2]. However, the test of the NoC itself for manufacturing faults has been marginally tackled. To the best knowledge of the authors, some NoC-specific test approaches were suggested in the literature [4], but no experimental results have been reported. It is demonstrated in the paper that straightforward Design-for-Test (DfT) approaches for embedded cores cannot be directly applied for NoCs without a considerable negative impact. Thus, we propose a scalable test strategy for the routers in a NoC, based on partial scan and on on-chip response evaluation. The proposed test strategy takes advantage of the NoC regular design to reduce test area overhead, test time and test data volume. The main assumption of this work is that there are several identical routers in the NoC. Other design choices of NoCs like routing, arbitration and flow control algorithms are supported by the proposed test strategy. Thus, the conclusions drawn here can be applied to a large class of network implementations where the main assumption is true.SoCin network [6] has been used as case study.

{"title": "Exploiting reconfigurability for low-power control of embedded processors\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes and evaluates a new implementation for the lowest level of instruction cache memories, which provides considerable power savings in the control memory subsystem of standard embedded processors. Instead of using power-demanding 6-T SRAMs for small I-caches, we exploit the possibility of using smaller switching capacitances, substituting the memory array with a specialized programmable logic circuit. Switching gains provided by this substitution are presented, illustrating a dramatic potential for power reduction in processor architectures for portable multimedia embedded applications.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["519"]}

{"title": "Tool-Set for Remote and Partial Reconfiguration\n", "abstract": " Using the features of the Virtex device, a set of tools for remote, partial and dynamic reconfiguration was developed. Remote reconfiguration allows to upgrade or to modify a system from a distant location, by sending a partial (or complete) bitstream via radio or any other media. Partial reconfiguration can be used to quickly modify the system, inserting or removing cores, interconnecting different pre-verified hardware modules, called IP cores, in a single Systems-on-Chip (SOC) design. Even though the tools are target to a specific device, their principles can easily be used to other FPGA families, if they have an internal structure allowing partial reconfiguration", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["519"]}

A metamodel for representing the process of obtaining an abstract description (ie a model) of a computational system is proposed and justified. To concretely illustrate the compromises involved in modeling computational systems, the paper shows a case study of specifying a telecom hardware module and describing it in two languages with widely different modeling assumptions, namely VHDL and SDL. The comparison of the resulting descriptions shows some of the strengths and weaknesses of each language in the chosen context. Thus, the adequate choice of languages to use for specifying and describing complex computational systems is showed to be a critical step of the implementation of technological products.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["519"]}

{"title": "Controling Configurations on Dynamic Reconfigurable Systems\n", "abstract": " Dynamically Reconfigurable Systems (DRSs) have the potential to provide hardware with flexibility similar to that of software. At the same time, they may lead to better performance and smaller system size. However, there is a clear lack of support devices, tools and design flows adequate for such systems. One of the main problems for enabling dynamically reconfigurable systems is the unavailability of efficient methods to control the hardware configuration process. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a configuration controller totally built in hardware. This is different from previous approaches, where software implementations dominate. The proposed controller has been implemented and validated in Virtex-II Xilinx FPGAs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["519"]}
