Designers cannot anticipate all the needs of users, but most begin with a prototype and revise it based on user feedback. This is even more true of online learning communities, where designers must understand the needs not just of individual users, but of groups of users and their complex inter-relationships as facilitated by the technology. Designers begin with theory, create a prototype, test, and then revise. However, it is not just the technology that can be revised, but also the underlying theory. Technological design and pedagogy have the potential to co-evolve in this new medium. In this chapter, I will describe in detail one example of this co-evolution: a new perspective on motivation in constructionist learning environments, which evolved through quantitative and qualitative observations of an online learning community called MOOSE Crossing. These observations1 I use the word community here in the loosest possible sense: a group of people interacting in some fashion over an extended period of time.

We use quantitative analysis techniques to examine the differences between the methods specifically concerning word count and qualitative codes. We find that there are differences between the methods, and that each technology has affordances that impact the data. Although phone interviews contain four times as many words on average as email and IM, we were surprised to discover that there is no significant difference in number of unique qualitative codes expressed between phone and IM.", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1195"]}

Our goal was to explore the potential of HCI in motivating students to pursue future studies in related computing fields. Participants in our course learned to make connections between the types of technology they use in their daily lives and the design processes that went into creating these technologies. We suggest that by portraying computing through the lens of HCI, as an innovative, creative, and challenging field with authentic, real-world applications, we may be able to motivate students to become more interested in computing.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["1195"]}

Among some groups, such as college students, video gaming is ubiquitous (Jones 2003). According to the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), 75 percent of heads of households in the United States play video games, and the average game player (not buyer) is 30 years old (ESA 2005). These statistics are strikingly similar in other countries; for example, in Great Britain 59 percent of the population between 6 and 65 years of age are gamers (Pratchett 2005). Video games are undeniably affecting our culture, the way we socialize and communicate, and how we think about the world. The increasing interest in video games has been accompanied by an explosion in the number of universities and colleges teaching \u201cgame courses\u201d and offering game-related degrees. Colleges and universities are not only teaching classes in game analysis, design, and development; they are also wrestling with how best to do so. For instance, in many game classes, students are asked to think critically about games as they play and analyze them, something they find challenging (Zagal and Bruckman 2007). Students often confuse being insightful about a game with being successful at playing it.Given these issues, how can we support learners in developing a deeper understanding of video games?

Young people have difficulty assessing the quality of information sources they find on the Web (Kafai, 1997; Wallace et. al. 2000; Kuiper, 2005). Helping students learn to critically assess sources has sometimes been portrayed as a typical learning problem: expert practices need to be made accessible to a generation of learners. Research has sought to identify differences between expert and novice strategies for assessing information sources (Wineburg, 1991); however, the recent proliferation of user-generated content has complicated matters. Sometimes experts disagree altogether about what constitutes a reliable source. In the absence of agreed-upon expert practices, what should students learn? Wikipedia sits at the center of this confusion. Students, teachers, parents, and researchers alike often do not understand how to critically assess Wikipedia articles because there is no widely shared understanding of how information production is regulated in a wiki environment. The nomenclature of \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d represents, among other things, broad recognition of new, distributed models of information production. Strategies like metacognitive prompts can help novices become more reflective about the sources they use (Stadtler & Bromme, 2007), but without a clear understanding of how publication works, it is unclear that novices can construct useful documents models on which to reflect. Before young people can learn to assess sources like Wikipedia, they need to first understand how such resources are created and maintained.

{"title": "Internet Research Ethics\n", "abstract": " In the mid-1990s, the Internet rapidly changed from a venue used by a small number of scientists to popular phenomena affecting all aspects of life in industrialized nations. Scholars from diverse disciplines have taken an interest in trying to understand the Internet and Internet users. However, as a variety of researchers have noted, guidelines for ethical research on human subjects written before the Internet's growth can be difficult to extend to research on Internet users. In this paper, I focus on one ethical issue: whether and to what extent to disguise material collected online in published accounts.

{"title": "The children's challenge: new technologies to support co-located and distributed collaboration\n", "abstract": " The popularity of Instant Messaging (IM) in online socializing has begun to migrate to use in the workplace. Many users are finding that the awareness and immediate contact that IM offers fills a missing niche in the technologies traditionally used in corporate settings to help keep colleagues connected over distance. Yet IM use in the workplace may have different design requirements than the online socializing context. This panel brings together representatives of some of the commercially popular IM systems and people who use IM in the workplace to raise the question of how the design of IM systems might need to evolve to meet the needs of workplace users.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1195"]}
{"title": "The electronic scrapbook: knowledge representation and interface design for desktop video\n", "abstract": " Video is increasingly being manipulated on computer systems. Can an interface for video manipulation be made sufficiently simple and powerful to free the user's attention to focus on creative aspects of the medium? How are images to be described so that they can be retrieved? How is this representation to be presented to the user? Issues of knowledge representation and interface design are tightly linked.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1195"]}
