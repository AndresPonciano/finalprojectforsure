{"title": "Semantic space: An infrastructure for smart spaces\n", "abstract": " Current pervasive computing research tries to merge the material and digi-tal worlds by incorporating physical and computing entities into smart spaces. Homes, workplaces, classrooms, vehicles, and other spaces use embedded sensors, augmented appliances, stationary computers, and mobile handheld devices to gather information about users\u2019 locations, companions, and other aspects of their activities. Applications in such environments must be context aware so that they can adapt to rapidly changing conditions as users move about in their environments. 1, 2 The dynamic nature of smart spaces poses several challenges in developing context-aware applications. For example:Rachel wishes to contact her friend Joey, so she instructs her mobile phone to arrange a call. Upon request, Joey\u2019s mobile phone checks the calendar and realizes he\u2019s currently attending a seminar. The phone determines on his behalf that he shouldn\u2019t be interrupted and schedules a call back when the seminar ends. Soon after the seminar, Professor Geller asks Joey to have a discussion in his office. Before the phone reminds Joey of the missed call as scheduled earlier, it wants to know whether his current situation is suitable for receiving the call. Based on contextual information (Where are you? Who are you with? What is the noise level? Is the door open or closed?) gathered in the smart space, the phone infers", "num_citations": "466\n", "authors": ["1623"]}

It is an excellent tool for modeling data and algorithms, but its object semantics are single threaded and operations are atomic. Therefore, it is difficult to use Object-Z to capture the behaviour of concurrent real-time reactive systems. On the other hand, Timed CSP is good at modeling real-time concurrent behaviour, but has little support for modeling the state of a complex system. This paper introduces a blending of Object-Z and Timed CSP, known as TCOZ.

In this work, we view motion planning from a probabilistic perspective. We consider smooth continuous-time trajectories as samples from a Gaussian process (GP) and formulate the planning problem as probabilistic inference. We use factor graphs and numerical optimization to perform inference quickly, and we show how GP interpolation can further increase the speed of the algorithm. Our framework also allows us to incrementally update the solution of the planning problem to contend with changing conditions. We benchmark our algorithm against several recent trajectory optimization algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that our approach is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness.

{"title": "On ribosome load, codon bias and protein abundance\n", "abstract": " Different codons encoding the same amino acid are not used equally in protein-coding sequences. In bacteria, there is a bias towards codons with high translation rates. This bias is most pronounced in highly expressed proteins, but a recent study of synthetic GFP-coding sequences did not find a correlation between codon usage and GFP expression, suggesting that such correlation in natural sequences is not a simple property of translational mechanisms. Here, we investigate the effect of evolutionary forces on codon usage. The relation between codon bias and protein abundance is quantitatively analyzed based on the hypothesis that codon bias evolved to ensure the efficient usage of ribosomes, a precious commodity for fast growing cells. An explicit fitness landscape is formulated based on bacterial growth laws to relate protein abundance and ribosomal load. The model leads to a quantitative relation between codon bias and protein abundance, which accounts for a substantial part of the observed bias for E. coli. Moreover, by providing an evolutionary link, the ribosome load model resolves the apparent conflict between the observed relation of protein abundance and codon bias in natural sequences and the lack of such dependence in a synthetic gfp library. Finally, we show that the relation between codon usage and protein abundance can be used to predict protein abundance from genomic sequence data alone without adjustable parameters.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1623"]}

The AMRSTP can be formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), but solving for the exact solution is impractical.

The Formal Methods community can also play an important role to contribute to SW development. Reasoning and consistency checking can be useful at many stages during the design, maintenance and deployment of SW ontology. However the existing reasoning and consistency checking tools for SW are primitive. We believe that formal techniques and tools, such as Alloy, can provide automatic reasoning and consistency checking services for SW. In this paper, we firstly construct semantic models for the SW language (DAML+OIL) in Alloy, and these models form the semantic domain for interpreting DAML+OIL in Alloy.

As a template to solve a certain recurring problem, a design pattern documents successful experiences of software experts and gradually becomes the design guidelines of software development. Applying design patterns correctly can improve the efficiency of software design in terms of reusability and enhance maintainability during reverse engineering. Software can be evolved when developers modify their initial designs as requirements change. For instance, a developer may add/delete a set of design elements, such as classes and methods. Modifications on software artifacts can introduce conflicts and inconsistencies in the previously applied design patterns, which are difficult to find and time-consuming to correct.

Although liberal composition of reusable components saves time and expense, many experiments indicate that people will pay for this (liberal composition) sooner or later, sometimes paying even a higher price than the savings obtained from reusing components. Thus, we advocate that more rigorous analysis methods to check the correctness of component composition would allow combination problems to be detected early in the development process so that people can save the considerable effort of fixing errors downstream. In this paper we describe a rigorous method for component composition that can be used to solve combination and integration problems at the (architectural) design phase of the software development lifecycle.

When the ratio exceeds the comfort level, travel adaptation is needed\u2013-use of a substitute vehicle, choice of an alternative transportation mode, or cancellation of a trip.

The core of such design problems is to find a good tradeoff between minimizing the capacity to reduce financial costs of drivers and increasing the capacity to satisfy daily travel demands. The major difficulty of such design problems lies in modeling the diversity of daily travel demands. Based on massive trip records of taxi drivers in Beijing, we find that the daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT) of a driver (e.g., a taxi driver) may change significantly in different days. This investigation triggers us to propose a mixture distribution model to describe the diversity in DVMT for various driver in different days, rather than the widely employed single distribution model. To demonstrate the merit of this new model, we consider value-at-risk and mean-variance battery capacity design problems for BEV, with respect to conventional single and new\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1623"]}
