{"title": "A decision support tool to optimize scheduling of IT changes\n", "abstract": " Change management is one of the most critical processes in IT management. Some of the reasons are the sheer number of changes and the difficulty of evaluating the impact of changes on the IT services being provided. Through carrying out a survey with IT managers and practitioners, we have found that, among the activities performed during change management, change scheduling (allocating changes to change windows) is the most problematic one. In this paper we solve the change scheduling problem by using a business-driven approach that evaluates the impact of a change schedule in terms of the financial loss imposed on the service provider. Toward this aim, we model the impact of SLA violations when the implementation of changes is done after their deadline. A change scheduling optimization problem is then formalized and its solution is applied to a typical scenario. The results show that optimizing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "59\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
{"title": "Business-driven decision support for change management: planning and scheduling of changes\n", "abstract": " From the results of a web survey we carried out in 2006, the main challenge in IT change management from a change manager\u2019s perspective was identified as planning and scheduling of changes. This paper begins to address this problem by taking business considerations into account; this is done through a business-driven IT management (BDIM) approach. A reference architecture that follows BDIM principles is sketched; it includes a mathematical model linking IT availability metrics to business objectives. Monetary loss due to service level violations on service availability is used as the main business metric. We present a numerical illustration of how the derived metrics may support change management decisions in order to plan and schedule changes to minimize adverse business impact.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
{"title": "Change priority determination in it service management based on risk exposure\n", "abstract": " In the Change Management process within IT Service Management, some activities need to evaluate the risk exposure associated with changes to be made to the infrastructure and services. The paper presents a method to evaluate risk exposure associated with a change. Further, we show how to use the risk exposure metric to automatically assign priorities to changes. The formal model developed for this purpose captures the business perspective by using financial metrics in the evaluation of risk. Thus the method is an example of Business-Driven IT Management. A case study, performed in conjunction with a large IT service provider, is reported and provides good results when compared to decisions made by human managers.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
{"title": "On the risk exposure and priority determination of changes in IT service management\n", "abstract": " This paper deals with the Change Management process within IT Service Management. Change Management includes several activities, some of which need to evaluate the risk exposure associated with changes to be made to the infrastructure and services. We present a method by which risk exposure associated with a change can be evaluated and the risk exposure metric is applied to the problem of automatically assigning priorities to changes. A formal model is developed to this end; the model captures the business perspective by using financial metrics in the evaluation of risk.

{"title": "WebManager: A Web-Based Network Management Application.\n", "abstract": " The implementation of a three-tier, Web-based network management application called WebManager is discussed. It is implemented in a UNIX environment, accesses management data through SNMP and is written in perl and C. Its main features include a Web-based interface, hierarchical network navigation maps, display of graphical statistics for any Management Information Base (MIB) variable, automatic color status indications for devices and sub-networks, full configurability and automatic alarms. This tool is currently being used in two production environments to manage networks with hundreds of nodes.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
{"title": "IGIS: um Framework para Sistemas de Informa\u00e7\u00f5es Geogr\u00e1ficas em N-Camadas usando um SGDB Objeto-Relacional\n", "abstract": " Many efforts to accomplish web based spatial information systems have been realized so far. However, some proposed solutions are too expensive and most of the times proprietary. Therefore, important issues in such web based systems such as interoperability and portability have not been contemplated. This paper describes a framework based on n-tier architecture, which aims to implement a web-based spatial information system. The main features of the framework is extensibility; the use of well-established standards such as OpenGIS and GML; lightweight and portable map rendering using SVG; and data persistence and spatial querying using an object relational database management system.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
{"title": "Business-driven technical debt prioritization: An industrial case study\n", "abstract": " Incorporating the business perspective into prioritizing technical debt is essential to contribute to decision making in industry. In this paper, we evolve and evaluate a business-driven approach for technical debt prioritization. The approach was evaluated during a five-months industrial case study with business and technical stakeholders' active participation. The results show that the approach contributed to aligning business criteria between the business and technical stakeholders. We also observed a downward trend in the amount of technical debt that affects high-value business assets. Moreover, we identified eight business factors that affect the decision making related to the prioritization of technical debt. The study results suggest that the proposed business-driven technical debt prioritization approach can help teams to focus their efforts on paying off the business' most relevant debt.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
{"title": "WebManager: Transforming a Network Management Application Into a Component-Based Framework.\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a network management tool. Visits to organizations of all sizes reveal that more than 95% of them are empty-handed as far as network management tools are concerned and pursue ad hoc management techniques. We argue that this sad state of affairs is due to the lack of cheap, easy to use tools. Although we don't solve the problem completely by providing such a tool, we show how a black-box component-oriented framework can be the basis for constructing it. We report on results of actual use of the tool to manage a small network and show that the postulated requirements (flexibility, scalability, ease of use and portability) are met.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
{"title": "Business-Driven Technical Debt Prioritization\n", "abstract": " Technical debt happens when teams take shortcuts on software development to gain short-term benefits at the cost of making future changes more expensive. Previous results show that there is a misalignment between the prioritization done by technical professionals and the prioritization expected by business ones. This paper presents a business-driven approach to prioritize technical debt items. The research is organized into four phases: exploratory, to identify the research focus; concept verification, where the proposed approach was evaluated on a multi-case study; solution, where a design science research was conducted to develop Tracy, a framework for technical debt prioritization; and validation. Results so far show that the business-driven prioritization of technical debt items can improve the alignment and communication between the technical and business stakeholders.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1330"]}
