{"title": "On web services based cloud interoperability\n", "abstract": " Cloud Computing is a paradigm shift in the field of Computing. It is moving at an incredible fast pace and one of the fastest evolving domains of computer science today. It consist set of technology and service models that concentrates on the internet base use and delivery of IT applications, processing capability, storage and memory space. There is a shift from the traditional in-house servers and applications to the next generation of cloud computing applications. With many of the computer giants like Google, Microsoft, etc. entering into the cloud computing arena, there will be thousands of applications running on the cloud. There are several cloud environments available in the market today which support a huge consumer-base. Eventually this will lead to a multitude of standards, technologies and products being provided on the cloud. Consumers will need certain degrees of flexibility to use the cloud application/services of their choice and at the same time will need these applications/services to communicate with each other. This paper emphasizes cloud computing and provides a solution to achieve Interoperability, which is in the form of Web Services. The paper will also provide a Live Case Study where interoperability comes into play\u2013Connecting Google App Engine and Microsoft Windows Azure Platform, two of the leading Cloud Platforms available today. GAE and WAP are two Cloud Frameworks which have very little in common, making interoperability an absolute necessary.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2132"]}
