The DINE model supports simultaneous, multiple issue, independent, peer-to-peer negotiations. It allows the integration of existing negotiation support techniques which, as opposed to DINE, mostly focus on those scenarios where the negotiation issues are shared by all negotiators. The latter techniques will be used to support the independent peer-to-peer negotiations in DINE. Negotiators may in fact use any tool even without DINE, as long as it supports the same peer-to-peer information sharing protocol.

The generic Augmented Lifecycle Space method, devised in an earlier paper, is applied as the approach to improve the capability of software processes requiring bidirectional traceability as well as consistency of the requirements in either homogeneous or heterogeneous development environments capitalizing on the emerging Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative. One of the important features of the presented new approach is that it allows for the so called \u201cgraceful integration\u201d of formal modeling.

{"title": "The use of deep knowledge from the perspectives of cooperative problem solving, systems modeling, and cognitive psychology\n", "abstract": " One of the points of the paper is that the exploitation of deep knowledge may well contribute to the appreciation of technology supporting small groups. The term deep knowledge is used in this paper for knowledge that is not only derived from rules acquired from experts, but is complemented with the application of usually numerical algorithms which incorporate a deep body of mathematical knowledge. A natural requirement in this context is the involvement of end-users in the mathematical modeling process. The selective usefulness of relational and functional modeling is analysed from this point of view. A graph theoretic algorithm is proposed for the support of relation building by end-users. The idea of spreadstructure is highlighted. Modeling is analysed from the perspective of cognitive psycholgy. Finally, a prototype modeling support system is presented which is built on the Microsoft Windows environment.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1361"]}

Intelligent service architectures for future e-mobility services are created, and accessibility requirements and demographic developments need to be considered. The production is more and more automated, decentralized and controlled by robots. To meet the future requirements of an electric car in the future, it is essential to combine different approaches with each other. Also the Internet of Things (IoT) leads to complete networking of humans, machines, environment, medical systems, transport systems, etc. Can we under these circumstances still use the typical innovation strategies or do we need new paradigms for generating innovation and managing innovation?

{"title": "Software Process Assessment and Improvement from a Decision Making Perspective\n", "abstract": " The quality of the process determines the quality of the product. This slogan is becoming more and more accepted in industrial production in general and in the software industry in particular. MTA SZTAKI recognized the importance of increasing the awareness of the benefits of software process improvement in Hungary. But managers making decisions need to be addressed in the language of business decisions which is mostly different from that of process quality experts. For this reason, we identified and analysed the business decision problems which are supported by various approaches to software quality. Our next objective is the application of multiple criteria decision making techniques to software process assessment and improvement.The evaluation of the quality of a software product is one of the basic issues in information technology. A system of product quality criteria is summarized in the ISO/IEC 9126\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1361"]}
{"title": "Protocols for Cooperative Multiple Criteria Decision Processes\n", "abstract": " In the group decision process a set of human decision makers work together to achieve common judgement on several issues. Decision conferences are usually synchronous, face-to-face meetings in decision room environments. If several similarly equipped remote decision rooms are connected via real-time video and/or audio links, a media space is created. In individual meeting rooms or multimedia technology created media spaces, meetings and decision making processes are supported by computer technology (eg network connected workstations) besides other forms of analog and/or digital communication technologies such as projected shared video screen, telephone, fax. This computational support usually covers different phases of the meeting (from brainstorming, through formal voting procedures to collaborative minutes writing), and uses computer network services for human participants and/or their software actors. In this paper a computational Reference Model of Distributed Group Decision Support Systems (RM-DGDSS) is presented within the framework of the Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing [RM-ODP 92]. The RM-DGDSS defines a distributed architecture for supporting a group of decision makers connected via computer network. Reference model defines a vision, a strategic outline for the standardization of this kind of distributed processing as well as the description and standardization of basic ideas, entities, algorithms of distributed group decision process.

{"title": "The Hungarian quality scene-potential for co-operation\n", "abstract": " The objective of this paper is to encourage the mutually beneficial cooperation between software and systems development organizations of Hungary and other countries. The Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) are analysed from the perspective of the possible exploitation of achievable financial, operating, marketing, and production leverages with Hungarian software firms. The benefits for cooperating partners are the following for example: highly educated workforce, cultural proximity, relatively low cost. Nevertheless, cooperation is difficult to initiate because of perceived threats arising from the former neglect of the development of a quality culture. This paper highlights the emerging trends in the Hungarian quality scene, and introduces a new opportunity for establishing mutually beneficial cooperation projects. The idea is to make use of ISCN as a coordinating agent with the role of assessing and improving the quality systems of potential Hungarian partners, reducing in this way the risks of other partners to cooperate with them. In the following we give an overview of the Hungarian information technology market in general and the software market in particular in order to introducing the environment in which Hungarian software firms are operating. A short SWOT analysis of Hungary in the software development area is presented next, followed by the results of a survey of the quality awareness of Hungarian software producing firms.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1361"]}

{"title": "Graphical representations in DSS and resource constrained scheduling.\n", "abstract": " The purpose of this paper is twofold. On one hand it supports those opinions which argue for the necessity of investing more effort into the starting and the final phases of an operations research project, which are strongly related to user interface management. On the other hand a specific area, resource constrained scheduling is highlighted. First, questions related to the object-oriented representation of multiple resource constrained schedules are discussed. Second, it is shown that there are questions related to graphical representation that are mathematically as involved as questions related to other phases of an OR project. In particular, two graph theoretical problems (Interval Chromatic number and Graph Acyclic Orientability With Weighted Diameter K) are formulated and shown to be useful when constructing a graphical representation for a schedule.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1361"]}
