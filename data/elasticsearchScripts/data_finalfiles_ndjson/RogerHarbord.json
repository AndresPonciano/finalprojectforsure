Conversely, genetic variants should not be related to the confounding factors that distort associations in conventional observational epidemiological studies. Furthermore, disease onset will not influence genotype. Therefore, it has been suggested that genetic variants that are known to be associated with a modifiable (nongenetic) risk factor can be used to help determine the causal effect of this modifiable risk factor on disease outcomes. This approach, mendelian randomization, is increasingly being applied within epidemiological studies. However, there is debate about the underlying premise that associations between genotypes and disease outcomes are not confounded by other risk factors. We examined the extent to which genetic variants, on the one hand, and nongenetic environmental exposures or phenotypic characteristics on the other, tend to be associated with each other, to assess the degree of confounding that would exist in conventional epidemiological studies compared with mendelian randomization studies.

{"title": "Alcohol intake and blood pressure: a systematic review implementing a Mendelian randomization approach\n", "abstract": " Background Alcohol has been reported to be a common and modifiable risk factor for hypertension. However, observational studies are subject to confounding by other behavioural and sociodemographic factors, while clinical trials are difficult to implement and have limited follow-up time. Mendelian randomization can provide robust evidence on the nature of this association by use of a common polymorphism in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) as a surrogate for measuring alcohol consumption. ALDH2 encodes a major enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism. Individuals homozygous for the null variant (*2*2) experience adverse symptoms when drinking alcohol and consequently drink considerably less alcohol than wild-type homozygotes (*1*1) or heterozygotes. We hypothesise that this polymorphism may influence the risk of hypertension by affecting alcohol drinking behaviour.   Methods and Findings We carried out fixed effect meta-analyses of the ALDH2 genotype with blood pressure (five studies, n = 7,658) and hypertension (three studies, n = 4,219) using studies identified via systematic review.

The objective of this study was to use different methods of weighting items included in a quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS) to produce an overall quality score, and to examine the effects of incorporating these into a systematic review. We developed five schemes for weighting QUADAS to produce quality scores. We used three methods to investigate the effects of quality scores on test performance. We used a set of 28 studies that assessed the accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux in children. The different methods of weighting individual items from the same quality assessment tool produced different quality scores. The different scoring schemes ranked different studies in different orders; this was especially evident for the intermediate quality studies. Comparing the results of studies stratified as \"high\" and \"low\" quality based on quality scores resulted in different conclusions regarding the effects of quality on estimates of diagnostic accuracy depending on the method used to produce the quality score. A similar effect was observed when quality scores were included in meta-regression analysis as continuous variables, although the differences were less apparent. Quality scores should not be incorporated into diagnostic systematic reviews.

{"title": "METANDI: Stata software for statistically rigorous meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies\n", "abstract": " Background: Many approaches to the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy are currently in use. Consensus is building that statistically rigorous methods involving hierarchical models are necessary to ensure valid results. Such methods correctly handle the correlation between sensitivity and specificity and the binomial distribution of the data within each study. There are two such models, the hierarchical summary ROC (HSROC) model and the bivariate random-effects model, which have been shown to be equivalent when no covariates are fitted, as well as in certain cases with covariates. Aim: To develop a user-written module metandi (Harbord 2008) for the statistical software package Stata that performs meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies without covariates and displays the results in both bivariate and HSROC parameterisations, as well as on a graph. Results: The user-written command gllamm and the (faster) official command xtmelogit introduced in Stata 10 can both be used to fit the bivariate model: the corresponding HSROC parameter estimates can also be produced after some extra work. The metandi module provides a straightforward interface in which a single command fits the model and (optionally) graphs the results, eg:. metandi tp fp fn tn, plot Conclusion: Increasing accessibility of statistically rigorous methods will increase their use and facilitate appropriate analyses.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1867"]}
{"title": "Polymorphisms in the\n", "abstract": " To the Editor: In their study of polymorphisms in the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene, Dr Lange and colleagues1 found that genetic variation in the CRP gene was associated with CRP levels and that genetic variants were differentially associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in white and black participants. The authors base their hypothesis on an analogous earlier study showing that the association of a PSSK9 variant with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and CVD suggested that lifelong reduction in LDL-C would reduce CVD. The likely effect of treatments targeting modifiable risk factors for CVD depends on robust causal inference of the risk factor\u2212 disease relationship, which is aided by mendelian randomization methods. Because these methods involve formally combining the CRP gene and gene-disease associations, 2 it is disappointing that Lange et al did not use their results to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1867"]}

{"title": "Generalized method of moments fitting of structural mean models\n", "abstract": " In this talk we describe how to fit structural mean models (SMMs), as proposed by Robins, using instrumental variables in the generalized method of moments (GMM) framework using Stata's gmm command. The GMM approach is flexible because it can fit overidentified models in which there are more instruments than endogenous variables. It also allows assessment of the joint validity of the instruments using Hansen's J test through Stata's estat overid gmm postestimation command. In the case of the logistic SMM, the approach also allows different first-stage association models. We show the relationship between the multiplicative SMM and the multiplicative GMM estimator implemented in the ivpois command of Nichols (2007). For the multiplicative SMM, we show\u00e2\u20ac\u201danalogously to Imbens and Angrist (1994) for the linear case--that the estimate is a weighted average of local estimates using the instruments separately. To demonstrate the models, we use a Mendelian randomization example, in which genotypes found to be robustly associated with risk factors from genome-wide association studies are used as instrumental variables, thereby investigating the effect of being overweight on the risk of hypertension in the Copenhagen General Population Study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1867"]}
{"title": "An overview of meta-analysis in Stata\n", "abstract": " A comprehensive range of user-written commands for meta-analysis is available in Stata and documented in detail in the recent book Meta-Analysis in Stata (Sterne, ed., 2009, [Stata Press]).The purpose of this session is to describe these commands, with a focus on recent developments and areas in which further work is needed. We will define systematic reviews and meta-analyses and will introduce the metan command, which is the main Stata meta-analysis command. We will distinguish between meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies, and we will discuss the additional complexities inherent in systematic reviews of the latter. Meta-analyses are often complicated by heterogeneity, variation between the results of different studies beyond that expected due to sampling variation alone. Meta-regression, implemented in the metareg command, can be used to explore reasons for heterogeneity, although its utility in medical research is limited by the modest numbers of studies typically included in meta-analyses and the many possible reasons for heterogeneity. Heterogeneity is a striking feature of meta-analyses of diagnostic-test accuracy studies. We will describe how to use the midas and metandi commands to display and meta-analyse the results of such studies. Many meta-analysis problems involve combining estimates of more than one quantity: for example, treatment effects on different outcomes or contrasts among more than two groups. Such problems can be tackled using multivariate meta-analysis, implemented in the mvmeta command. We will describe how the model is fit, and when it may be superior to a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1867"]}
{"title": "An empirical comparison of methods for meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic accuracy\n", "abstract": " Background: Reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies are being incoporated into the Cochrane Collaboration. There is limited practical experience with statistical methods for such reviews, and uncertainty as to the most appropriate choice of method. Objective: To compare the results of four methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies when applied to 9 diagnostic meta-analyses. Methods: We applied the following models: 1. Separate random-effects meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity, ignoring any correlation between them, fitted by (1a) random-effects meta-analysis of logit-transformed sensitivity and specificity and (1b) using random-effects logistic regression; 2. Summary ROC (SROC) curve fitted using simple linear regression [Littenberg & Moses, Med Decis Making 1993]; 3. Bivariate random-effects meta-analysis of (logit-transformed) sensitivity and specificity [van Houwelingen et al., Stat Med 2002]; 4. Hierarchical SROC (HSROC) model [Rutter & Gatsonis, Stat Med 2001]. We fitted model 2 in Stata, and models 3 and 4 using the SAS NLMIXED procedure. We did not include covariates. We compared summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity (models 1, 3 and 4) and SROCs (models 2 and 4). Results: In all examples, there was evidence of heterogeneity in one or more parameters. Methods 3 and 4 gave the same summary estimates in all cases. The results of method 1a were very similar to these. Method 1b gave results differing noticeably from these others in 2 cases out of 9. In 6 cases, the SROC estimated using method 2 was similar to that using method 4. In two cases method 2 gave a more asymmetric\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1867"]}
