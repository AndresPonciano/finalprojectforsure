{"title": "Stirner: the ego and its own\n", "abstract": " Max Stirner's The Ego and Its Own is striking and distinctive in both style and content. First published in 1844, Stirner's distinctive and powerful polemic sounded the death-knell of left Hegelianism, with its attack on Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno and Edgar Bauer, Moses Hess and others. It also constitutes an enduring critique of both liberalism and socialism from the perspective of an extreme eccentric individualism. Karl Marx was only one of many contemporaries provoked into a lengthy rebuttal of Stirner's argument. Stirner has been portrayed, variously, as a precursor of Nietzsche (both stylistically and substantively), a forerunner of existentialism and as an individualist anarchist. This edition of his work comprises a revised version of Steven Byington's much praised translation, together with an introduction and notes on the historical background to Stirner's text.", "num_citations": "915\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

By a genome-wide association study (320 patients and 1,500 controls) and subsequent replication altogether involving a total of 3,300 Asian SLE patients from Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Thailand, as well as 4,200 ethnically and geographically matched controls, genetic variants in ETS1 and WDFY4 were found to be associated with SLE (ETS1: rs1128334, P = 2.33\u00d710\u221211, OR = 1.29; WDFY4: rs7097397, P = 8.15\u00d710\u221212, OR = 1.30). ETS1 encodes for a transcription factor known to be involved in a wide range of immune functions, including Th17 cell development and terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes. SNP rs1128334 is located in the 3\u2032-UTR of ETS1, and allelic expression analysis from peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed significantly lower expression level from the risk allele. WDFY4 is a conserved protein with unknown function, but is predominantly expressed in primary and secondary immune tissues, and rs7097397 in WDFY4 changes an arginine residue to glutamine (R1816Q) in this protein.

{"title": "Men against the State\n", "abstract": " The writing of a history of anarchism in the United States will run into the difficulties created by the necessity of establishing criteria for the purpose of separating i anarchism from other expressions of radical social thought which may be allied to but are distinct from it. On the verbal level the most perplexing problem is that of definition of terms, beginning with the basic word itself. In one respect the obstruction may never be bridged. An almost insuperable barrier has been the matter of semantics. The use of the term as an identification for a social order characterized by the absence of the State is quite recent. As used by Pierre Joseph Proudhon in this way, it is hardly more than a century old. However, its association with reprehensibility in this country has generally greatly restricted its use for descriptive purposes. European radicals have been far less inhibited in this way, hence the study of anarchism there is relatively unimpeded by hesitancy on the part of radicals to disclose themselves. Their propaganda has been open and identified, and thus may be readily examined.The reluctance to openly declare positions which has been a periodic matter of concern in all areas of radicalism in America makes such an approach here out of the question. Thus the problem of discovering anarchist literature and sentiments when disguised as something else. The constant use of less highly-charged words to describe anarchist propaganda is still another situation which is essentially American. In such a way, anarchist doctrines have found acceptance here when identifica-", "num_citations": "186\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Consequently, the prevalence of white coat hypertension in primary care settings and the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of this subgroup of patients are not well known. We performed this study to estimate the frequency of white coat hypertension in a population of mildly to moderately hypertensive subjects attended in a primary care setting and to examine possible epidemiologic and clinical factors that may identify these patients. Patients included in the study underwent clinical interview, measurement of clinic blood pressure (BP) on three visits, determination of serum lipids, glucose, uric acid, and urinary albumin excretion, 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, and M-mode and Doppler echocardiography. Patients were classified as white coat hypertensives if their daytime ambulatory BP were< 135/85 mm Hg. We studied 345 patients, 136 (39%) of whom were diagnosed with white coat hypertension. The frequency of white coat hypertension was inversely proportional to the severity of clinic BP values. The diagnosis of white coat hypertension was independently associated with female gender and low educational level. Left ventricular mass index and urinary albumin excretion were lower in the white-coat hypertensive group compared with the group with sustained hypertension.

At each step, after a normally open switch is closed, the heuristic procedure establishes the switching-options significantly reducing (in most cases) the number of candidate branches to be opened within a loop. Finally, the choice of the most effective switching-option for loss minimization is obtained from the calculation of a few power flows.

Instantaneous injection pressure, needle lift, and rate of injection were also measured, allowing calculation of the instantaneous nozzle discharge coefficient. Short-exposure still photographs were obtained at various chamber pressure and densities to further investigate this spray. Correlations between droplet size and velocity were determined at each crank angle to observe the detailed nature of the transient events occurring in this transient diesel fuel spray. As expected, peak mean and rms velocities are observed in the center of the spray. Measured average velocities are consistent with a calculated value, using the discharge coefficient for the nozzle and the known rate of fuel injection. The spray was nearly symmetric, with higher velocities occurring near\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "76\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "A comparative study of fabric protection against ultraviolet-induced erythema determined by spectrophotometric and human skin measurements.\n", "abstract": " Historically, a textile's ability to protect against ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced erythema has been based on its UVR transmission. However, due to the nonuniformity of the fabric structure of a textile and its resultant nonuniform transmission, the above prediction may not hold. The fabric protection factors (FPF) of 5 metal meshes, to simulate the weave pattern and yarn dimensions of typical fabrics, and 6 textiles with variable construction (woven and knitted), fibre type and dye were determined using a spectrophotometric assay and human skin testing. All 5 meshs and 5 of the 6 textiles allowed spectrophotometric prediction of their FPF compared with off-skin (2 mm) human testing. However, on-skin human testing FPF were generally significantly lower than both the off-skin and spectrophotometric estimates. Although evidence is presented that the nonuniform nature of a textile's structure does influence its FPF predictability, in practice, properly conducted spectrophotometric analysis may yield the most typical indication of the protectiveness of a fabric against UVR-induced erythema.", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 26 racehorses. PROCEDURE: Videoendoscopy of the larynx was performed while horses were at rest and exercising on a treadmill. Horses were classified as having grade-IIIA,-IIIB, or-IIIC laryngeal hemiparesis on the basis of the degree of arytenoid cartilage abduction maintained during exercise. Postoperative racing performance was determined by evaluating race records and conducting telephone surveys. RESULTS: 20 (77%) horses had grade-IIIC laryngeal hemiparesis (ie, severe dynamic laryngeal collapse during exercise). Eighteen underwent surgery, and racing performance was improved in 9. Five (19%) horses had grade-IIIB laryngeal hemiparesis (ie, left arytenoid cartilage and vocal fold were maintained in an incompletely abducted position during exercise). Four underwent surgery, and racing performance was improved in 1.

Both are included in an evaporitic Messinian succession. The primary variety of mineralization is within carbonates that interfinger with, and prograde across, gypsum deposits.The development of these deposits can be interpreted in the context of the general evolution of the Granada Basin during Late Tortonian and Messinian times. Open marine conditions prevailed during the late Tortonian.

Located in the Navajo Nation in Northeast Arizona, the school began its English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) instruction in 1960 and bilingual education in 1967. In 1982, the first high school seniors were graduated. By 1988, 43 percent of Rock Point students were dominant Navajo speakers and only 5 percent were dominant English speakers. Under the Rock Point bilingual curriculum instituted in 1967, kindergarten students are taught reading in Navajo. The program features a locally trained Navajo teaching staff and a bilingual curriculum that is not dependent upon supplemental funding. Navajo language teachers in grades K-12 are paid from the same main contract funds as most English language teachers. The bilingual program is viewed as both a coordinate and a maintenance program, with instruction in the two languages kept separate but complementary. A summary of the Navajo and English curriculum for grades K-6 is illustrated. Research support for the Rock Point program is reported, including educational areas that need to be addressed to empower Indian students. The development of Navajo curriculum materials is also described, and the use of standardized tests to evaluate the Rock Point program is discussed. Finally, community involvement is cited as a component in the success of the Rock Point program. Contains 17 references.(LB)", "num_citations": "60\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

SL genes in both arrays are interrupted by a total of eight conserved insertion elements. Cleavage of genomic DNA at restriction sites present within the insertion element but not in the SL gene repeat, releases variable numbers of SL genes from the tandem array. Since the insertion element contains a terminal poly(A) track of 36 bases and because a 49\u2010bp duplication of target DNA has occurred at the integration site, we conclude that it is a retroposon.

Serine protease PB92 is a member of the subtilase family of enzymes, which has been extensively studied. These studies have included exhaustive protein engineering investigations and X-ray crystallography, in order to provide insight into the mechanism and specificity of enzyme catalysis. Distortions have been observed in the substrate-binding region of subtilisin crystal structures, due to crystal contacts. In addition, the structural variability in the substrate-binding region of subtilisins is often attributed to flexibility.

The mature forest with larger leaf area and wetter and cooler soils has a net uptake of carbon 3.3 times that of the young plantation. In the spring, photosynthesis is larger at the mature site as expected based on the difference in leaf area, however, another important factor is the reduction in springtime respiration at the mature site due to lower soil temperatures because of more shade from the canopy.

The laser diode linewidth can be stabilized from several MHz for high resolution spectroscopy of species at low pressures, to several hundred MHz for lower resolution spectroscopy of species at atmospheric pressures.", "num_citations": "48\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Nevertheless, a steam explosion process could also be used as pretreatment before chemical pulping, expecting a reduction in cooking time due to the open structure of the exploded chips. Thus, to evaluate the effect of steam explosion as a pretreatment in the kraft pulping of Eucalyptus globulus, steam exploded chips and control chips were subjected to kraft cookings. Steam exploded chips provided pulps with reductions of kappa number by up to 70% with no significant change in viscosity. Therefore, the cooking time could be shortened by 60%, increasing the productivity and obtaining pulps with similar delignification degree to those of the control pulp. Furthermore, not only the production rate could be increased, but also most of the hemicelluloses could be recovered before pulping and converted to a value-added product. Finally, although exploded pulp had inferior mechanical strength, the optical properties, which are more important in eucalyptus pulps, were found to be better.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The AOM allows in-coupling efficiencies in excess of 40%, which is two to three orders of magnitude higher than in conventional systems using a cavity mirror for in-coupling. The AOM shutoff time is shorter than the roundtrip time of the cavity. The higher light intensities lead to a reduction in shot noise, and allow the use of relatively insensitive but fast-responding detectors such as photovoltaic detectors. Other deflection devices such as electro-optic modulators or elements used in conventional Q-switching may be used instead of the AOM.

During the first three decades of this century, classical studies of clinical disorders and physiological experiments had shown that this region, weighing scarcely 4 g in adult humans, was associated with a wide variety of behavioral, autonomic, visceral, and endocrine functions. By 1939, knowledge of the hypothalamus had been defined sufficiently to justify a meeting of the Association for Research in Nervous and Mental Disorders. The 1940 volume summarizing this work proved to be a landmark and in turn, inspired many new studies. Many of the questions raised by workers of that era now appear to have been answered in a definitive fashion and entirely new concepts of nervous system function and neurohumoral control have now emerged.

The aim of this work was: 1) To determine whether the increase in gamma-cystathionase activity occurring in the fetal-to-neonatal transition is due to up-regulation of its mRNA and protein, 2) To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for this increase in gamma-cystathionase activity. Our results show that expression of gamma-cystathionase at both the mRNA and protein levels was higher in newborn than in fetal liver. gamma-Cystathionase activity in fetal hepatocytes in vitro increased when incubated with tert-butyl-hydroperoxide at low concentration (0.01 mM). Hence, moderate oxidative stress would act as a signal to up-regulate gamma-cystathionase in the fetal to neonatal transition. Stress hormones, such as phenylephrine or glucagon also increased gamma-cystathionase activity in fetal hepatocytes. We also report a competitive inhibition of purified gamma-cystathionase by L-cysteine, which would help to maintain physiological low L-cysteine levels in hepatocytes. In conclusion, our results show that increased hepatic gamma-cystathionase activity in the fetal-to-neonatal transition is due to up-regulation of its gene expression mediated by stress hormones together with the physiological oxidative stress that occurs at birth.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Using a global meta\u2010analysis, we quantified the proportion of variability that each of 12 taxonomic groups (at the Order level or above) explained in the richness or composition of other taxa. We then applied optimization to matrices of pairwise congruency to identify the best set of complementary surrogate groups. We found that no single taxon was an optimal surrogate for both the richness and composition of unmeasured taxa if we used simple methods to aggregate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The Ala-168 mutant exhibited different substrate specificity than wild-type and enhanced thermal stability. The thermodynamic profiles for penicillin G hydrolysis catalyzed by both enzymes were obtained from the temperature dependence of the steady-state kinetic parameters Km and kcat. The high values of enthalpy and entropy of activation determined for the binding of substrate suggest that an induced-fit-like mechanism takes place. The Met\u2192Ala168 mutation unstabilizes the first transition-state (E\u00b7\u00b7S\u2260) and the enzyme-substrate complex (ES) causing a decrease in association equilibrium and specificity constants in the enzyme.

Epinephrine (0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 micrograms/kg) and lidocaine (0.4 mg/kg, with and without 0.2 micrograms/kg of epinephrine) were administered intravenously to seven chronically instrumented pregnant guinea pigs near term. Lidocaine without epinephrine did not significantly alter maternal heart rate (MHR), maternal mean arterial pressure (MMAP), or UBFV. Epinephrine, with and without lidocaine, resulted in a transient decrease in MHR. Further, epinephrine, with and without lidocaine, resulted in significant elevations in MMAP and significant, dose-related reductions in UBFV. Mean (+/-SEM) UBFV was 72+/-4%, 56+/-4%, and 40+/-5% of baseline at 30 s after administration of epinephrine, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 micrograms/kg, respectively.

Her constructive analysis proceeds through Balthasar\u2019s critical reception of Vladimir Soloviev, Nicholai Berdyaev, and Sergei Bulgakov with respect to theological aesthetics, myth, eschatology, and Trinitarian discourse and examines how Balthasar adjudicates both the possibilities and the limits of theological appropriation, especially considering the degree to which these Russian thinkers have been influenced by German Idealism and Romanticism. Martin argues that Balthasar\u2019s creative reception and modulation of the thought of these Russian philosophers is indicative of a broad speculative tendency in his work that deserves further attention. In this respect, Martin consciously challenges the prevailing view of Balthasar as a fundamentally conservative or nostalgic thinker. In her discussion of the relation between tradition and theological speculation, Martin also draws upon the understudied relation between Balthasar and FWJ Schelling, especially as Schelling's form of Idealism was passed down through the Russian thinkers. In doing so, she persuasively recasts Balthasar as an ecumenical, creatively anti-nostalgic theologian hospitable to the richness of contributions from extra-magisterial and non-Catholic sources.", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

However, wear is still a problem for the durability of DLC coatings. Tensile stress on the surface of DLC coatings has an important effect on the wear behavior during friction. To improve the tribological properties of DLC coatings, we investigate the friction process and wear mechanism under various tensile stresses by using our tight-binding quantum chemical molecular dynamics method. We observe the formation of C\u2013C bonds between two DLC substrates under high tensile stress during friction, leading to a high friction coefficient. Furthermore, under high tensile stress, C\u2013C bond dissociation in the DLC substrates is observed during friction, indicating the atomic-level wear. These dissociations of C\u2013C bonds are caused by the transfer of surface hydrogen atoms during friction. This\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "New theropod tracksites from the Upper Cretaceous \u201cMesaverde\u201d Group, western Colorado: implications for ornithomimosaur track morphology\n", "abstract": " The track-rich, coal-bearing Upper Cretaceous Mesaverde Group is widely exposed in Colorado and Utah, and well-known as a source of large dinosaur tracks (mostly hadrosaurs, with less numerous ceratopsid and theropod tracks) often extracted from coal mines. Pterosaur, bird, frog and mammal tracks are also known, but rare. Recent discoveries of abundant small theropod tracks from Mesa County, western Colorado, indicate that small theropod tracks are also abundant locally, and useful for interpreting the dinosaurian ichnofaunas in a unit with few vertebrate body fossils. Three sites in the vicinity of De Beque Canyon, Colorado all yield a variety of theropod tracks. Localities designated as De Beque Canyon sites 1 and 2 yield only small samples, in contrast with the Horse Canyon site, which yields several track-bearing surfaces, including one with at least 34 well-preserved, small (foot length=~ 10-15 cm), gracile, bird-like, tridactyl tracks (Morphotype A) with relatively wide digit divarication angles. These tracks resemble Ornithomimipus angulatus from the Upper Cretaceous of Canada except that they are smaller. The tracks comprise about 20 trackways with the same sense of direction, and therefore suggest the movement of a group of theropods. They co-occur with at least four trackways of a more robust Grallator-like form (Morphotype B) with low divarication angles. Poorly-preserved traces include some that are tentatively interpreted as faint bird tracks. Ornithomimipus likely has coelurosaurian (probably ornithomimosaur) affinities, and has diagnostic characteristics that justify erecting the new ichnofamily Ornithomimipodidae\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "31\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

These lesions have been associated with specific entities, allowing a better categorization of NHL. However, these abnormalities are not as specific as initially described and their association is still unknown. DESIGN AND METHODS: By Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction, we have simultaneously analyzed the proto-oncogenes Bcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, c-myc and MLL and the tumor suppressor genes p53 and p16, in 100 unselected B-cell NHL patients at diagnosis, to establish its incidence throughout the different NHL subtypes, defined both by Working Formulation and REAL classifications, and to assess the frequency of co-existence of two or more genetic lesions within each individual patient. RESULTS: Fifty two cases displayed some genetic abnormality. Bcl-1, altered in 12 cases, was highly specific to mantle cell lymphomas (57% of them), but 6 cases had a different histologic subtype. Bcl-2 was rearranged in 26 cases: 70% in follicular lymphomas (FL) and 20% in diffuse large cell lymphomas; these abnormalities were also present in other subtypes, ie marginal lymphomas (30%). Bcl-6 abnormalities were mostly found in diffuse large cell lymphomas (29%) but also found in other subgroups, like FL (14%). C-myc rearrangements were specific to Burkitt's lymphoma. MLL gene was always germline. Deletions and/or rearrangements of p53 and p16 genes were rare (4% and 8% of all cases, respectively).

DESIGN: Cross-sectional case series. ANIMALS: 42 horses with a history of poor performance. PROCEDURE: A TW was performed via endoscopy before and after horses exercised on a high-speed treadmill, and specimens were evaluated microscopically and graded. RESULTS: Ten (24%) horses were considered to be clinically normal before and after exercise. Pulmonary hemorrhage was diagnosed in 8 (19%) horses. One horse had evidence of exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) before exercise and pulmonary hemorrhage and allergic or inflammatory airway disease (IAD) after exercise. Five (12%) horses had IAD, and 1 had IAD and pulmonary hemorrhage after exercise. Seven (17%) horses had evidence of EIPH and IAD in both specimens. Four (10%) horses with EIPH had an increase in the proportion of hemosiderophages in the specimen obtained after exercise. Specimens obtained before exercise in 6 (14%) horses were not representative of the respiratory tract and could not be compared with specimens obtained after exercise.

We investigated an accelerated cardiovascular calcium overload model in young rats produced by treatment with a single dose of vitamin D3 (300,000 IU/kg, im) followed by up to 4 days of twice daily doses of nicotine (25 mg/kg, po). Large increases in the calcium content of the aorta, kidneys, and myocardium but not in the liver or brain were seen. The magnesium content of these tissues was not modified. On the day following the last nicotine injection, there was marked cardiovascular calcium overloading, the aortic calcium level increasing by up to nine times that of controls. The animals had lower body weights, however, and there was a significant degree of mortality (up to 42%). Signs of kidney failure were evident; the blood urea level, for instance, was doubled. If rats were allowed 13 or 180 days to recover, they showed normal growth and kidney function; aortic calcium overload was still pronounced: 16-and 7-fold increases, respectively. Cardiovascular function in recovery animals was characterized by a doubling of pulse pressure. Dose-response curves following noradrenergic stimulation were shifted to the right after 13 (but not after 180) days recovery. Arterial norepinephrine content doubled. The chronic effects of hypervitaminosis D plus nicotine may produce a useful model for the study of the physiological and/or pharmacological consequences of calcium overload.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the safety and efficiency of ambulatory treatment of acute diverticulitis in a selected group of patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of domiciliary oral antibiotic therapy for acute diverticulitis in a cohort of patients in the Emergency Surgery Section of our hospital. Seventy-four patients (44 men and 30 women) were included between 2000 and 2006. Patients with Hinchey stage 1 diverticulitis and those with Hinchey stage 2 diverticulitis and abscesses of less than 3cm, who were clinically and biochemically stable, were selected. The patients were treated with oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for 7-10 days. Follow-up was performed in the outpatients unit with clinical evaluation at 10 days and an imaging test at 1 month. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 55 years. The most frequent clinical presentation was spontaneous abdominal pain associated with leukocytosis. The mean duration of treatment was 8.8 days. Four patients (5.4%) required subsequent hospital admission for intravenous antibiotic administration and 70 (94.6%) completed treatment without complications. During follow-up, two cases of colonic adenocarcinoma and six cases of polyposis were diagnosed. Only 13 patients underwent elective surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In most of the patients studied, ambulatory conservative management was safe and effective in the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

The existence of 11 BCCs was confirmed using an elicited list task and a free monolexemic naming task. From the results provided by a synonymicity estimation task, it was concluded that, in Spanish, 2 synonymous terms (morado and violeta) are used to name a category equivalent to the English category purple. Three experiments provided information about the colourimetric localization of the 11 Spanish BCCs. Two experiments used monolexemic naming tasks (free and restricted) and a third required the free signalling of prototypes and good exemplars. It was observed that Spanish and British BCCs are essentially equivalents in number and colourimetric delimitation and, therefore, our work can be considered to extend and complement previous research (on English BCCs) insofar as achromatic categories in colour space localization, the links between chromatic and achromatic categories (red and orange have no direct links with achromatic categories), and the dependence of the use of BCCs on lightness are concerned. Lastly, our results indicate the existence of 2 categories that are nearly basic: beige and garnet.Our main research goal is to provide an accurate response to the following questions: What are the basic Spanish colour categories (BCCs)?

We measured in situ respiration rates of Piloderma mats and neighboring non-mat soils in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in western Oregon to investigate whether there was higher respiration from mats, and to estimate mat contributions to total soil respiration. We found that areas where Piloderma mats colonized the organic horizon often had higher soil surface flux than non-mats, with the relative increase in respiration averaging 16% across two growing seasons. Both soil physical factors and biochemistry were related to the higher surface flux of mat soils. When soil moisture was high, soil CO2 production was concentrated into near-surface soil horizons where mats tend to colonize, resulting in greater apparent differences in respiration between mat and non-mat soils. Respiration rates were also correlated with the activity of chitin-degrading soil enzymes. This finding supports the notion that the abundance of fungal biomass in EcM mats is an important driver of C and N cycling. We found Piloderma mats present across 57% of the exposed soil, and use this value to estimate a respiratory contribution from mats at the stand-scale of about 9% of total soil respiration. The activity of EcM mats, which includes both EcM fungi and microbial associates, appeared to constitute a substantial portion of total soil respiration in this old-growth Douglas-fir forest.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Anecdotal data suggest that synaesthetes are particularly sensitive to inconsistencies between their synaesthetic percepts and the real world, e.g., it can be annoying and unpleasant for them to see a letter printed in a colour different than the respective photism colour. For R, a synaesthete subject who participated in the present study, the photisms possess specific emotional values (a red photism is pleasing and attractive, green is repulsive and unpleasant, etc.). In contrast to the anecdotal data, R does not always find the colour\u2013photism incongruence to be disturbing. More importantly, he states that it is the emotional coherence between the stimulus and the corresponding photism that matters. In a series of experiments, we studied this new concept of emotional coherence on three\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

DESIGN: Controlled, randomised clinical trial. SETTING: 87 primary care centres. Spain. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 450 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were included. INTERVENTION: Two groups of 225 patients were formed: 1) Control group (CG): standard health intervention; 2) Intervention Group (IG): received a twice monthly educational magazine at home. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Compliance was measured using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS-Aardex). Compliance rate (CR) was recorded. Compliers were defined as individuals with a treatment compliance of 80-110%. The percentage of compliers, the mean percentage of doses taken and the percentage of patients taking the medication at the correct times were estimated. The mean blood pressures (BPs) and the percentage of controlled patientswere calculated. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 393 individuals were evaluable (Age: 62.4 years), 196 in the IG and 197 in the CG. There were 83.2%(95% CI 78-88.4) and 49.2%(95% CI 42.2-56.2)(P= 0.0001) of overall compliers in the IG and CG, respectively and 74%(95% CI: 67.9-80.1) and 42.6%(95% CI= 35.7-49.5)(P= 0.0001) of correct times compliers.

The diagnosis was made via myelography-computed tomography. OBJECTIVES: The authors emphasize the importance of a proper approach in diagnosing a subarachnoid-pleural fistula and treating this clinical condition correctly. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Myelography-computed tomography was used to diagnose the subarachnoid-pleural fistula. It was necessary to re-open the thoracotomy to seal the dura mater because the pleuroperitoneal shunting was not effective. METHODS: The patient presented with an intradural and extramedullary thoracic neurinoma located on the anterior part of the spinal canal that was causing anterior spinal cord compression. A lateral extracavitary approach was taken with a thoracotomy, with the tumor being completely removed. During the postoperative period, the patient had a persistent pleural effusion. The diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid fistula was made via myelography-computed tomography. Implantation of a pleuroperitoneal shunt was unsuccessful, and it was necessary to re-open the thoracotomy to seal the dura mater. RESULTS: Myelography-computed tomography successfully helped diagnose the subarachnoid-pleural fistula and identify the precise anatomic location of the leakage. Pleuroperitoneal shunting was not effective in dealing with the pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS: This complication should be taken into account when this kind of surgical approach is performed.

The nuclear translocation of the protein must depend on other factors beside the temperature per se since at 28\u00b0 C, in stationary phase growing parasites, the Hsp70 protein was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. During recovery at 28\u00b0 C the protein leaves the nuclei but the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of the protein is a much more gradual process than its initial transport to the nucleus. Since the isoform of the nuclear Hsp70 is different from that found in the cytoplasm it is likely that before translocation to the nucleus the cytoplasmic Hsp70 nuclear precursor must undergo a specific modification.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Sarcomas represent about 1% of cancer in adults. The annual incidence in adults in Europe is around 14,000 new cases of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and 4,800 new cases of bone sarcomas. Musculoskeletal tumours arise anywhere in the body, although lower extremities are the most common site of appearance, followed by upper extremities, trunk, retroperitoneum and head and neck area. Adequate management of STS is a stimulating challenge for oncologists. The aim of treatment should be focused on four main aspects: improving survival, avoiding local recurrence, maximising organ function and, finally, minimising morbidity. Surgery, radiotherapy and, sometimes though increasingly, chemotherapy are the pillars on which rests the modern treatment of sarcomas. The optimal management of musculoskeletal tumour requires a multidisciplinary integration of these different approaches in treatment planning right from the initial diagnoses.

High resolution TEM (HR-TEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) are used to investigate the short-range order in the MoS2 crystallites of the coating. HR-TEM studies show that most of MoS2 crystallites exhibit many imperfections including faults, kinks, and curvature. Most of the vacuum-deposited MoS2 coatings contain significant amounts of oxygen in their structure, mainly because small amounts of water are present during the sputtering process. The oxygen incorporation affects the crystalline structure, the orientation, and the film morphology. A typical shift of the (100) peak is observed in X-ray diffraction and is strongly correlated with the oxygen content in the film. This shift has been attributed to the (100) lattice contraction.

The settlement mechanism for stranded costs currently prevailing in Spain leads unambiguously to lower prices; it actually acts as a countervailing force to market power and high prices in these markets.

{"title": "Ephedra: a C to Java migration environment\n", "abstract": " The Internet has grown in popularity in recent years, and thus it has gained importance for many current businesses. They need to offer their products and services through their Web sites. To present not only static content but also interactive services, the logic behind these services needs to be programmed.  Various approaches for programming Web services exist. The Java programming language can be used to implement Web services that run both on Internet clients and servers, either exclusively or in interaction with each other. The Java programming language is standardised across computing platforms and has matured over the past few years, and is therefore a popular choice for the implementation of Web services.  The amount of available and well-tested Java source code is still small compared to other programming languages. Rather than taking the risks and costs of redeveloping program libraries, it is often preferable to move the core logic of existing solutions to Java and then integrate it into Java programs that present the services in a Web interface.  In this Ph.D. dissertation, we survey and evaluate a selection of current approaches to the migration of source code to Java. To narrow the scope of the dissertation to a reasonable limit, we focus on the C and C++ programming languages as the source languages. Many mature programs and program libraries exist in these languages.  The survey of current migration approaches reveals a number of their restrictions and disadvantages in the context of moving program libraries to Java and integrating them with Java programs.

DESIGN: Sixty patients (44 males, mean age 62+/-13 years) with acute coronary syndrome and 40 with stable coronary artery disease (31 males, age 64+/-10 years) and a control group of 40 individuals (34 males, 53+/-5 years) were analyzed. IgG against Chlamydia pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus and Helicobacter pylori plus C-reactive protein were assessed in all serum samples. In addition, IgM against C. pneumoniae and Cytomegalovirus on admission and C-reactive protein one month later were measured in acute patients. RESULTS: No IgM seropositivity was observed. A high prevalence of IgG seropositivity with no significant differences among the groups was found: C. pneumoniae: acute group 44 (73%), stable group 29 (73%) and control group 25 (63%); Cytomegalovirus: 55 (92%), 37 (92%) and 38 (95%), respectively; and H. pylori, 43 (72%), 32 (80%) and 34 (85%) respectively. There was a high rate of positive C-reactive protein in the acute group: 48 (80%) vs 10 (25%) the stable group and 0% the control group (p< 0.001). C-reactive protein levels were higher in Q-wave infarction than in unstable angina/non-Q-wave infarction (median 22.65 vs 7.69, p< 0.001). One month later, C-reactive protein levels decreased (median 22.65 vs 3.38, p< 0.001), but were still positive in 40%.

The consideration of some form of roll stabilizer has been an accepted step in the design cycle of larger ships for a number of years. For smaller vessels, however, particularly those that are built to individual designs, there has been an assumption that any type of roll stabilization is too costly and cannot be accommodated in the crowded arrangements that are typical of such ships. This is unfortunate because the benefits derived from any additional roll damping are much more apparent for these smaller ships, which generally have shorter natural roll periods due to relatively high\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

This enables divalent class II molecules to deliver two different messages to T cell: 1) a two\u2010peptide message, in which the tetramer with two identical peptides is able to cross\u2010link two TCRs triggering full activation of a T cell. At the thymic level we propose that this message induces negative selection; or 2) a one\u2010peptide message: only one of the peptides loaded in the class II tetramer is able to interact with that TCR.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and characteristics of fluid and electrolyte disorders in the immediate postoperative period after surgery for CNS tumors in children treated in our hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory data in all infants and children who underwent surgery for CNS tumors in our hospital from January 1998 to June 2005 and who met the laboratory criteria for diabetes insipidus, SWS or SIADH. RESULTS: Twenty-three electrolyte disorders were identified in 149 surgical patients (an incidence of 15.4%). The median age was 5 years and 3 months (from 6 months to 17 years) and 48.7% of the patients were male.

The objective of this study was to determine the clinical characteristics of fatal and NFA crisis in patients sensitized to Alternaria. PATIENTS AND METHOD: One hundred ninety four patients with fatal or NFA attacks were enrolled in a multicenter (33 Spanish hospitals), prospective study. We gathered the characteristics and clinical course of the crises. We performed the following tests: spirometry, prick-test to common allergens, and specific IgE to Alternaria when patients were in stable condition. The sensitization test to Alternaria was performed when the prick-test and/or specific IgE levels were positive. RESULTS: Twenty (10%) patients were sensitized to Alternaria. When compared to non-sensitized patients, Alternaria sensitized patients were significantly younger, 35 (15) vs 50 (21) years old (p< 0.001); their hospital admission length was shorter, 6.5 (5.5) against 9 (7) days (p= 0.039); they had a higher number of deaths or severe neurological sequelae, 15 vs 3%(p= 0.026); they had a higher sensitization frequency to the remaining allergens, 68 against 22%(p= 0.003); and they exhibited a fewer bronchodilation response upon inhaled salbutamol, 6 vs 10%(p= 0.013).

To address this question, mercury (Hg) concentrations in perch (Perca fluviatilis) muscle tissue from five lakes were analyzed for two years before (2010\u00a0\u2212\u00a02011) and three years after (2013\u20132015) forest harvest conducted in 2012. Fish Hg concentrations in the clear-cut catchments (n\u00a0=\u00a01373 fish specimens) were related to temporal changes of fish Hg in reference lakes (n\u00a0=\u00a01099 fish specimen) from 19 lakes in the Swedish National Environmental Monitoring Programme. Small (length\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0mm) and large perch (length\u00a0\u2265\u00a0100\u00a0mm) were analyzed separately, due to changing feeding habitats of fish over growing size.

The equipment needed to measure swing speed is sophisticated and has high data reduction overhead. For this reason, relatively little data exist describing bat motion in field conditions. The following describes results of one of the most ambitious swing speed studies ever conducted. The study involved bats of nearly constant weight and varying inertia that were swung by 29 adult batters. The study was conducted using right handed batters on a regulation outdoor field with a live pitcher. Swing speed was measured by tracking markers on the bat with two high speed video cameras. The cameras were arranged and calibrated so that the bat markers could be traced in three-dimensional space. The ball's pitch speed, hit speed and inclination were also tracked and compared to a three-dimensional Doppler radar system. Comparison\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Lack of an association between CKMM genotype and endurance performance level in Hispanic marathon runners\n", "abstract": " Introduction and aim of the study: Genetics plays a key role in determining endurance performance. We examined the association between a genetic polymorphism at the muscle-specific creatine kinase (CKMM) locus and endurance performance level (EPL) in elite Hispanic marathon runners. Materials and methods: DNA samples were successfully genotyped from 380 Hispanic marathon runners (men n= 220; women n= 160). Cases (n= 190; men= 110, women= 80) were finishers in the top 3 percentile, while controls (n= 190; men= 110, women= 80) were those in the lowest 3 percentile of their respective age and gender. Genotypes were determined by PCR and digestion with NcoI endonuclease.Results: The three expected genotypes for the CKMM-NcoI were observed in the cases and controls. These genotypes frequencies, within each gender, were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (\u03c72, P\u2265 0.05) and were not significantly (\u03c72, P> 0.05) different between genders. There was no gender difference (P\u2265 0.05) in the allelic frequencies. The pooled data for both genders revealed no significant differences in genotype (P\u2265 0.05) or allele (P\u2265 0.05) frequencies between cases and controls. Conclusions: These results replicate the findings of a previous study in Caucasians (Med Sci Sports Exerc. 1997; 29: 1444-47) and suggest that the CKMM-NcoI polymorphism is not an important determinant of endurance performance level.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analytical study in a primary care area in Madrid from 2001 to 2003. Random sampling of 450 healthcare professionals was performed on 2 occasions. The sample was stratified into 3 groups: group I (clinicians, pharmacologists, psychologists), group II (nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, social workers) and group III (administrative staff, porters, auxiliary nurses). The self-administered questionnaire QPL-35 was sent in January 2001 and January 2003 and on each occasion the questionnaire was sent again 1 month later. The percentages of total responses and responses per item were studied. We also studied the distribution of each answer by examining the floor effect and ceiling effect, as well as the factorial composition based on a previous validation study. RESULTS: Five hundred sixty-three questionnaires (62.6%) were returned. All the questions had a response rate of more than 96%. At least one unanswered question was found in 22.0% of the questionnaires, and at least 2 were unanswered in 7.1%. The distribution of the answers did not fit normal distribution in any of the cases. The floor effect was present in questions related to management support and the ceiling effect was found in those related to motivation.

METHODS: This was a prospective analytical study. We studied sixty-four eyes from 32 patients with cataracts. After a random assignment, phacoemulsification with the implant was performed using the Acrysof SN60AT tinted lens in one eye and Acrysof SA60 in the other. A variety of variables was subsequently assessed: contrast sensitivity with a CSV 1000E test, colour perception through a Farnsworth 25 test and subjective measures by a patient survey. Differences between the groups were assessed statistically. RESULTS: The contrast sensitivity results were obtained for 3, 6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) frequencies under scotopic conditions, with better results obtained following the use of SN60AT: 0.75 (CSV 1000E test units) for 3 cpd, 0.86 for 6 cpd, 0.54 for 12 cpd and 0.35 for 18 cpd. The differences were statistically significant between the two groups for 3 cpd and 6 cpd. A total of 62.5% of patients using a tinted lens and 50% with SA60 achieved good results in the Farnsworth test; 12.5% and 21% had fair results and 25% and 28.1% respectively had poor results. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained an improvement in favour of the tinted lens for all frequencies, with this being statistically significant at lower frequencies (3 and 6 cpd). No significant differences in the Farnsworth test performance or in the patient survey were found. The tinting provided by the IMPRUV filter brings an increase in contrast sensitivity without affecting colour perception.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

As with all surgical procedures, it carries risk, with the most commonly reported complications including infection, bile leak and bleeding. One unusual complication is subcapsular liver haematoma, the diagnosis presented here. This is a rare occurrence; only a small number of cases have been reported in the literature and as yet no conclusive cause or management plan has been found. Iatrogenic liver trauma, the use of oral and intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anticoagulants have all been named as possible contributing factors. Particularly, the use of ketorolac has been associated with four reported cases of subcapsular haematoma following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Should sufficient fissile material accumulate a quasi-steady-state (QSS) transient criticality event could result. A computer model has been developed to understand the evolution and consequences of such an event.

A total cystpericystectomy was                    done, leaving the left lateral section of the                    liver that was fixed to the diaphragm.                    Postoperatively, the patient developed                    obstructive jaundice. An ERCP showed an                    obstruction at the junction of the left biliary                    duct and the main biliary duct and contrast                    leak. At reoperation, the main duct was ischemic,                    likely due to torsion along its longitudinal                    axis. A hepatotomy was done at the hilar plate,                    and the biliary duct was dissected and                    anastomosed to a Roux-en-Y jejunal loop.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Spanish pevalences for never smokers, current smokers and former smokers estimated from national health surveys, and relative risks for death attributed to tobacco use from the Cancer Prevention Study II were used. The proportion and number of deaths attributed to tobacco use in the Spanish population of 35 years and over have been calculated by cause of death, sex and age. The trend in mortality attributable to tobacco use over the period 1978-1992 has also been calculated, expressed as the mean percentage change per year in the standardised mortality rates, estimated by a log-lineal model. RESULTS: Tobacco consumption caused 46,226 deaths in Spain in 1992. Most of them occurred in males (93.4%). One of every 4 deaths in males, and one of every 50 in females were attributable to tobacco consumption. One third of the deaths attributed to tobacco use were premature deaths (under 65 years). Lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease caused 75% of deaths attributed to tobacco use. Lung cancer was the first specific cause in males, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the main cause in females. A total of 621,678 deaths attributed to tobacco consumption were produced in the period (1978-1992). The main percentage change per year in the mortality rates shows a moderate increment of 0.1%(-0.2% in males+ 6.7% in females).

The aim of this study is to identify a surrogate endpoint for use with 3D scaffolds. Murine RAW 264.7 cells are cultured on dense discs of \u03b2\u2010tricalcium phosphate in conditions to stimulate osteoclast (OC) formation. Multinucleated OCs are visible from day 6 with increases at days 8 and 10. Resorption pits are first observed at day 6 with much larger pits visible at days 8, 10, and 12. The concentration of calcium ions in the presence of cells is significantly higher than cell\u2010free cultures at days 3 and 9. Using linear regression analysis, Ca ion release could account for 35.9% of any subsequent change in resorption area.

Among species in the Canarian enid genus Napaeus, some rock-dwelling species cover the shell with lichens; in one of these, N. barquini, the process is known to be active. In some ground-dwelling species the muddy covering may be acquired passively, as for example in N. variatus. Napaeus badiosus is a snail with an almost smooth shell which is not disguised in the field. It normally rests out of sight of predators. Four specimens of N. badiosus were transferred to a glass terrarium with a layer of loose, humid soil without stones and vegetation. The snails acquired a soil layer with prominent protuberances that covered the whole shell, reducing the risk of attack by visual predators. The appearance of the disguised N. badiosus shell is compared with those of N. barquini and of N. variatus. The disguise of N. badiosus is similar to that of N. barquini. This active disguise thus appears to be facultative, adopted when hiding places are not available. Mechanisms of disguise are briefly discussed; the behaviour of other disguised species should be investigated.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Subcolony characteristics and breeding performance in the Chinstrap Penguin Pygoscelis antarctica\n", "abstract": " Subcolony characteristics and breeding performance in the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica. Aims: Subcolonies of penguins differ markedly in physical characteristics and in breeding success. Subcolony size is the best studied subcolony characteristic and has been suggested to be an important factor explaining the variation in reproductive success. Small subcolonies generally have lower breeding success, probably because they suffer from worse environmental conditions. It is likely that lower quality individuals also occupy smaller subcolonies, which in turn affects breeding success. However, results are not always consistent, and other subcolony characteristics may mediate breeding success. In the present study, the relationship is investigated between physical subcolony characteristics (slope, isolation and size) and several variables indicative of individual quality and breeding success in the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica.Location: The study was performed in the Vapour Col chinstrap penguin colony on Deception Island (South Shetlands Archipelago, 63\u221e 00\u2019S, 60\u221e 40\u2019W) during the austral 2002-03 breeding season.

It is used as an osmotic agent at 7.5% for peritoneal dialysis (PD). Its use in PD has been associated with several side effects separate from the one reported here, the most frequent being sterile peritonitis. Recently, three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of sterile peritonitis: allergy to dextrin, production of anti-dextran antibodies, and impurities introduced during manufacture. Here, we report a peritoneal mononucleosis outbreak that is highly suggestive of being a consequence of the last-mentioned mechanism. During the period December 2001 to May 2002, a group of 8 Spanish hospitals whose individual PD programs regularly share information and activity reported 29 cases of sterile peritonitis associated with icodextrin use in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients [mean age: 60.7+/-14.47 years; 8 women (27.59%), 21 men (72.41%); mean time on PD: 25.21+/-35.31 months; mean time on icodextrin: 15.17+/-11.03 months].

Both appear to modulate protein phosphorylation, at least in part, through protein kinase C (PKC) raising the question as to whether they concurrently impact on macrophage\u2010like cells. In this regard, we utilized the CSF\u20101 dependent murine macrophage\u2010like line BAC 1.25F5. CSF\u20101 treatment of these cells for 30 min leads to particular phosphorylation of a 165 kDa protein, the putative CSF\u20101 receptor, and a 210 kDa moiety. 1,25(OH)2D3 exposure for 24 h prior to addition of CSF\u20101 enhances phosphorylation of the 165 kDa species and, especially, the 210 kDa protein. Phosphorylation of the latter protein is 1,25(OH)2D3 dose\u2010 and time\u2010dependent and the molecule is specifically immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010talin antibody.

{"title": "Calcium and ATPase activity during hepatic intoxication with thioacetamide.\n", "abstract": " The effects of acute thioacetamide (TAA) intoxication on the calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium content of liver and on its ATPase activities were studied in rats. Samples of liver were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry for their cationic content 6, 24 and 48 h after administration of TAA through a stomach tube. After sonification other samples were assayed for (Na++ K+)-dependent,(Ca2++ Mg2+)-and Ca2+-dependent ATPases. No apparent correlation has been found between the increased hepatic calcium after TAA treatment and the variations of ATPase activity. Both calcium movement and ATPase activity appear sex-determined. These results bring support to the hypothesis that an interaction between TAA or its metabolites with the cell membrane provokes an increased influx of extracellular calcium. The relationship between this calcium increase and the changes in ATPase activity with the events triggering the neoplastic transformation is discussed.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

This article examines how five secondary school teachers assimilated different Internet resources into their teaching practice. Using a system for analysing classroom interaction that allowed us to segment teaching practice into categories differentiated by their level of generality, we studied the recordings of five class sessions in which Internet resources were used. The results show that common patterns existed in the way these teachers handled their sessions. The most outstanding pattern showed the overriding importance of curricular tasks and contents in the class sessions, and the subordination of the ICT resources to these curricular elements. It is also important to underscore the appearance of one type of task performance activity with ICT in all the sessions analysed, although more analysis about this activity is needed.

A model for the joint distribution of flood peaks at pairs of catchments has been developed. The relationship between flood return periods is linked to physical differences between catchments. The model thus allows estimation of the statistical distribution of the flood return period expected at one site during a flood of specified return period elsewhere.

PARTICIPANTS: A total of 149 sanitary workers with some burnout sign measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) participated. MEASUREMENTS: They fulfilled MBI, Goldberg Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), and CVP-35 questionnaires at the beginning and after a year of follow-up, in which 73 subjects took part in activities for coping stress. It was assessed the change of PQL and their domains managerial support (PQL-MS), work load (PQL-WL), intrinsic motivation (PQL-IM) for the subjects with variations at the MBI, or GHQ-28 punctuation greater than 0.5 SD of the initial distribution. RESULTS: Variations in CVP-35 and their domains correlate weakly with changes in MBI and GHQ-28 (r< 0.500), but they are congruent with the conceptual model. In the individuals with significant variations in the GHQ-28, they appreciate an average change in PQL and their domains between 0.18 and 0.55 points (absolute value). In those with significant variations in the MBI domains, PQL presented average absolute variations between 0.23 and 0.45 points, PQL-MS between 0.30 and 0.67, PQL-WL between 0.01 and 0.55 and PQL-IM between 0.22 and 0.83 points.

In this work, the synthesis of mesostructured silicas (MCM-41 and SBA-15 type materials) functionalized with butenyl groups is studied through the use of post-synthetic grafting or direct-synthesis procedures. Results confirm the higher functionalization degree achieved in the final mesostructured materials when using direct synthesis procedures. Unlike MCM-41 materials, which become microporous when high organic content are attached on, SBA-15 type butenyl functionalized silicas keep the features of a mesoporous solid.

{"title": "Ordering criteria and information fusion in 3D laser surveying of small urban spaces\n", "abstract": " The introduction of laser-based photogrammetry in the surveying of Cultural Heritage provides an increasing volume of data, which requires multi-resolution approaches for analyzing and displaying the 3D information. Three-dimensional laser scanning provides accurate geometric and radiometric information about buildings fa\u00e7ades and volumetric display of bounded urban zones. In particular, it makes possible the generation of 3D models of scanned areas allowing a customized management of navigation through the data. Some complexity issues are linked to the unordered character of scanned points, making difficult the application of traditional software libraries of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. Ordering criteria based on geometric and radiometric criteria simplify the computer management of architectural and urban primitives and allow perform a hierarchised approach by making compatible recognition tasks with different levels of detail and 3Dvisualization. The integration of geometric and radiometric information on a discrete volumetric model given by dense clouds of 3D points simplifies an interactive generation and management of virtual models with accurate information. Several illustrations of bounded urban zones corresponding to Spanish urban squares are given. The automatic identification of dominant planes in clouds of points reduces in a drastic way the volume of original clouds of points, and provides inputs for synthetic geometric information, which can be managed by a CAD programs. Transference of information is symbolically managed on geometric primitives, given by dominant planes which are optimally fitted\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1574"]}
{"title": "The Roman theatre of clvnia: hybrid strategies for applying virtual reality on laser scanning 3D Files\n", "abstract": " Digital acquisition, processing and visualization of archaeological sites require increasing performance for software tools. The application of hybrid methodologies based on digital information poses new challenges for satisfying professional and entertainment requirements, helping to have a better understanding of archaeological sites. A faithful representation of the current state is displayed by combining high resolution photogrammetric recording with Computer Vision to provide an accurate 3D model of the archaeological site. The aim of this work is to construct a 3D model for the roman theatre of Clvnia, a very large archaeological site to provide an assessment about conservation and restoration policy. To achieve it, a feedback between bottom-up approach for processing and top-down for visualizing is performed from dense clouds of 3D points captured with an ILRIS 3D scanner of Optech. The superposition of meshes and maps of level curves provides friendly visualizations with a low cost. In our approach, slices of clouds of 3D points are exported to CAD for cartographic, planimetric and visualization purposes, including Digital Elevation Maps of the archaeological site. Fitting of geometric primitives is semi-automatically performed in an interactive way. A Virtual Reality module is developed for adapting exported slices of laser scanning files and for obtaining a realistic rendering. The hybrid methodology developed in this work is enough flexible to be adapted to another environments, including urban scenarios or isolated buildings in Cultural Heritage surveying.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

DESIGN: Analytical cross-sectional study. SETTING: Area 11, primary care, Madrid. PARTICIPANTS: The professionals in the area (1436) were stratified into three groups: I) doctors, pharmacists and psychologists; II) nurses, midwives, physiotherapists and social workers, and III) administrative and nursing assistants and caretakers. INTERVENTIONS: A satisfaction questionnaire (PQL-35) was sent out to 450 professionals selected at random. 282 replies were received (62.7%). All calculations used 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The mean PQL score (scale from 1 to 10) was 5.14 (4.90-5.37); for intrinsic motivation (IM), 7.41 (7.26-7.53); for management support (MS), 4.80 (4.64-4.96); and for work-loads (WL), 6.06 (5.91-6.21). Perception of PQL was higher in women, group II and professionals with fewer work demands. Perception of best MS was in women, urban centres and people in charge of administrative areas. Women and temporary workers had higher IM. WL perception was higher in groups I and III. Age, marital status, work shift, length of employment, number of companions and belonging to management committees were not related to PQL. In the multi-variate analysis MS was found to be the factor most affecting PQL. CONCLUSIONS: Perception of PQL is medium-low, with adequate intrinsic motivation but a certain discontent related to high work-loads and perception of scant management support.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The maximum concentrations of radionuclides of caesium and strontium in macro lichens exceeded those known from literature for the Arctic areas during the period of nuclear testing. In 1986 the highest concentration of'1 37 Cs in Estonia-6.2 kBq/kg was measured in the Cetraria islandica in LNP. In Rumpo Sanctuary the highest concentrations of caesium radionuclide were estimated in July 1986-4.5 for Cl. rangiferina and 4.4 kBq/kg for C. cucullata. Radiocaesium content decreased rapidly in the following years. The highest rate was established for Cl. rangiferina-12.5 in three years. The absolute values of radiostrontium content in the four investigated lichen species before and after the Chernobyl accident do not differ considerably. The decrease of 90 Sr concentration is more evident for Cl. rangiferina-from 62 in July 1986 to 15 Bq/kg in October, 1988. The same trend is obvious for the radionuclides store: in July 1986 the store of 137 Cs in the lichen cover was\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

A laser beam, introduced into the combustion chamber through an optical port in the cylinder head, was reflected by a polished surface on the piston crown. Motion of the reflected beam, carrying with it information on piston position and piston tilt, was monitored by a set of receiving optics. Piston motion was studied as a function of both engine speed and cylinder pressure (i.e., piston loading.) Measured axial piston-position was found to deviate from the theoretical position calculated from the measured crank-shaft position owing to the effects of tilt and piston loading. Furthermore, evidence of piston veer (tilt of the piston in a plane parallel to the axis of the wrist pin) was observed, which had an effect on the accuracy of the axial piston\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The results obtained extend the domain of validity of a correlation used in chemical engineering to the field of 2-phase flow in porous media in the case of a trickel flow regime. Moreover, they show that the gas-liquid mass transfer is slow and that the thermodynamic equilibrium is never reached at the present operating conditions. This may be due to channeling effects observed by a direct visual technique and could explain some of the problems encountered during the partially miscible floods used for enhanced oil recovery.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The ability of the uterus, vagina, anterior pituitary and anterior hypophysis to take up and retain oestradiol has been proposed as a distinctive character for the oestrogenic target organs. Although no specific protein receptors have been isolated in the neocortex, the administration of oestradiol was able to increase the incorporation of cytidine to RNA, and the protein synthesis. Those findings, together with the fact that oestradiol is concentrated and retained in the nuclei of the cerebral cortex, forced us to review the concept of target organs. The presence of very small quantities of oestradiol in the central nervous system cell nuclei may reflect the amounts that the tissue requires, and the emphasis that has always been put on quantity should be placed on there-sholds for oestrogen action in different\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 105 patients with melanoma and suspicion of recurrent melanoma by clinical symptoms in 38 cases or equivocal/positives morphological tests (TC, MR, US) in 77 cases. In all patients a whole body scan was performed with FDG-PET (ECAT HR+) after an intravenous injection of 444-518 MBq of 18F-FDG, in normoglucemia conditions, and previous administration of muscular relaxant, hydration and diuretic. Images were evaluated by 2 dxpert nuclear physicians and were analysed qualitatively and semiquantitatively. In 48 cases the results were confirmed by histology and clinical evolution (follow-up period> 12 months) and imaging tests in 57 cases. RESULTS: Prevalence of recurrent melanoma was 63.8%. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of FDG-PET was 97%, 97.2%, 98.5%, 82% y 94.7% respectively. FDG-PET had led to a management change in 48 cases (38%).

Energy density is influenced most by the water and fat content of foods. Reducing dietary fat has been shown to reduce body weight, but no studies have examined the effects on dietary energy density and body weight of incorporating water-rich foods into a reduced-fat diet. The present study tested two strategies to reduce dietary energy density on weight loss over one year. Obese women were randomly assigned either to a group counseled to reduce fat intake (RF group; n= 49) or a group counseled to reduce fat intake and increase intake of water-rich foods, particularly fruits and vegetables (RF+ FV group; n= 48). No goals for energy or fat intake were assigned; subjects were instructed to eat ad libitum amounts of food while following the principles of their diet. Study completers in both groups (n= 71) achieved significant weight loss at 6 months (p< 0.03) and maintained most of this loss at 12 months.

{"title": "Risk injuries at operating and delivery rooms.

The objective of study was to describe and evaluate the risk of occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens at operating and delivery rooms, from reports of injuries in health care workers. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Transversal study of percutaneous injuries occurring in operating and delivery rooms which were registered in the Spanish surveillance system EPINETAC (Exposure Prevention Information Network Accidents) between 1996 and 2000. We recorded data from the exposed health care worker, from the accident itself and from the exposure source. The risk of exposition was calculated by logistic regression. The dependent variable was the exposition in operating/delivery rooms. We calculated the rate of exposure, total and by occupational categories, per 10,000 surgical procedures in 3 surgical specialties. RESULTS: There were 3,625 percutaneous injuries reported. The exposure risk was higher in midwives [OR 36.6 (CI 95% 19.61-68.52)] than in staff [OR 12.6 (CI 95% 10.21-15.71)] or training doctors [OR 12.8 (CI 95% 10.34-15.98)]. The highest risk turned up during use of material [OR 1.37 (CI 95% 1.05-1.79)] and during preparation of material for reuse [OR 1.81 (CI 95% 1.27-2.59)]. The exposure rate, in gynecologic procedures, was 34.36 injuries per 10,000, in digestive surgery it was 24.61 per 10,000, and in trauma surgery it was 18.92 per 10,000 surgical procedures.

METHODS: The records of patients that had been treated at the Urology services of our hospital over the last 8 years were reviewed. During this period, patients with erectile dysfunction were treated according to a protocol. RESULTS: There were 9 episodes of priapism in 8 patients; all cases were low flow and the patients were aged 37-71 years. The duration of the prolonged erection ranged from 4 to 72 hours. Of these 9 cases, the etiology was intracavernosal PGE in 7, after trazodone administration in one case, and unknown in one case. Intracavernosal metoxamine was administered in all cases with excellent results, except one case that required a saphenous-cavernosal shunt and another case that was initially treated with adrenalin also with good results. CONCLUSIONS: Since intracavernosal agents have been utilized in the treatment of erectile dysfunction, priapism has become a more frequent urological emergency.

In this way, AW is able to positively ascertain which mutations are in the same chromosome (cis\u2010linkage) and assigns alleles independently from each other. Artificial sites are created in the PCR step in order to positively detect substitutions not naturally recognized by any of the existing or convenient enzymes.

During OHT, CIED leads are divided during transection of the superior vena cava (SVC) and are extracted by traction. Complete lead removal however is sometimes not possible due to adherence to the vessel wall. The most common sites of retained hardware in OHT recipients are the subclavian vein, innominate vein or the superior aspect of the SVC [2]. Although previous studies in non-transplant patients have suggested that retained leads are a common occurrence and not of major long-term sequelae, this has been infrequently studied in OHT recipients [2, 3].

The classic treatment with loop diuretics is ineffective due to the resistance of the kidney to those drugs, which requires the use of other therapies, such as extracorporeal ultrafiltration and peritoneal dialysis. This last technique is useful both in the acute treatment of acute heart decompensation and the chronic management of heart failure, because it improves heart function by reducing the volume overload, which in turn contributes to improving the kidney function with a limited number of side effects, which makes it the technique of choice for the treatment of diuretic-resistant heart failure.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A study on the prevention of anastomotic healing defects by applying biological adhesives along the suture line began in January 2007, and included the hospitals, Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Universitario de San Carlos, and Hospital del Sureste, in Madrid. The enrolled patients were randomised to one of 2 groups: the study group in which the adhesive was applied to the suture line, and a control group in which it was not applied. The primary outcome of the study was the presence or absence of leaks. The trial was approved by the corresponding Clinical Research Ethics Committees and the Spanish Medicines Agency (AEMPS) and registered www. clinicaltrials. gov (NCT01306851). The authors declared not to have any conflict of interests with the company, Baxter, which markets the product in Spain. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were recruited between January 2007 and November 2010, of whom 52 were randomised to the study group, and 52 to the control group.

The aim of this research is to know some possible predictors factors of this violence, in order to prevent it. METHOD: A two-year long retrospective study was carried out on acts of physical violence committed by schizophrenic in-patients in a General Hospital. This group was compared with a non-aggressive control group. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (29) patients committed ninety (90) acts of assault. The predictive value for violence has been evaluated using twelve variables (court orders, clinical diagnosis, past history of violence, sex, age, married, single, employment status, profession, cohabitation, previous hospitalizations and recent hospitalization) through Discriminative Analysis of the aggressive group and another control of seventy-two (72) non-aggressive schizophrenic patients. Four significant variables turned out to be predictive of violent behaviour: being clinically diagnosed as residual, having a past history of violence, being unemployed and living alone. CONCLUSIONS: The fact of being diagnosed as residual schizophrenia is always predictive of very aggressive behaviour. Using these four variables, a classification tree for violence prediction in schizophrenic in-patients has been established.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The Researchers of the 4 Provinces Study\n", "abstract": " INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Spain shows an important variation in the geographical distribution of ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease mortality. In this article, the primary objectives and design of the Four Provinces study are described. In this study we analyzed the contribution of environmental factors (diet, lipid profile and plasma antioxidants), acting in childhood, to explain differences in cardiovascular mortality rates between different provinces in Spain. METHODS: An ecological design was projected in which the units to study were four Spanish provinces with a wide variation in cardiovascular mortality in adulthood. The design compares diet, anthropometric variables and biological markers (particularly plasma lipids and antioxidant levels) in 6-7-year-old children, between the two provinces with the highest cardiovascular mortality rates and the two provinces with the lowest. The information for each province is collected in a cross-sectional manner in a representative sample of children from each province. DISCUSSION: Evidence from the literature concerning Northern European countries suggest the contribution of environmental factors during early age in the development of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. The\" Four Provinces\" study will provide, for the first time, information about the influence of factors in early childhood of cardiovascular risk in a Mediterranean country. The study will also offer interesting data about food intake during school age in four provinces and it will allow us to estimate values of population of the variables of interest in those provinces.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The chemical mechanism of catalysis was dependent on the deprotonation of a histidine residue with pK about 5.7. This result was supported by the perturbation of pK values by addition of organic solvent. Very high and exothermic enthalpy of ionization was measured, indicating that a conformational re-arrangement in the enzyme accompanies the ionization of the essential histidine residue.

Ephedrine, 1.0 mg/kg, was administered intravenously to ten chronically instrumented pregnant guinea pigs near term, before and after intravenous infusion of terbutaline and acute hemorrhage. Before terbutaline and hemorrhage, ephedrine increased maternal mean arterial pressure (MMAP) by 30+/-1%(P=. 0001) and 17+/-1%(P=. 0001) at 30 s and at 1 min after injection, respectively; UBFV was decreased by 10+/-4%(P less than. 01) and 14+/-4%(P less than. 01) at 1 min and at 90 s after injection, respectively. Infusion of terbutaline (1.5-6.0 ug X kg-1 X min-1) increased maternal heart rate (MHR) by 22+/-1%(P=. 0001), decreased MMAP by 13+/-2%(P=. 0001), and decreased UBFV by 24+/-3%(P=. 0001). During hypotension resulting from acute hemorrhage, ephedrine, 1.0 mg/kg, was superior to placebo in restoring MMAP and UBFV toward the prebleed values. The authors concluded that ephedrine, 1.0 mg/kg, results in a small, transient decrease in UBFV in the normotensive gravid guinea pig. However, ephedrine aids restoration of UBFV in the gravid guinea pig rendered hypotensive by acute hemorrhage during terbutaline infusion.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Two types of transformation of plant material into humic acids are considered in this report. The first is the microbial transformation of phenolic constituents already present in the plant materials; in particular, the decomposition and transformation of lignins is reported. The second is the microbial biosynthesis of the phenolic compounds from aliphatic precursors and their transformation into humic acids. To study the transformation of lignins, different lignin alcohols and phenols were synthesized and labelled in different C-atoms with 14C. They were polymerized by means of phenolases and added to cultures of lignin-degradating fungi. The aim of these experiments was to get a more complete picture of the stability of each C-atom in the framework of the lignin molecule against microbial attack. They showed a preferential instability of the benzene nucleus in comparison with the connecting side chains. The breakdown of the lignin molecule is therefore effected by a previous splitting of the ring component and afterwards by a disconnection of the aliphatic side chains, The microorganisms used for studying the processes of lignin decomposition were basidiomycetes, which were either white rot fungi or were isolated from soils. Most of them did not form considerable amounts of humic acids. Other fungi common in different soils were ascomycetes. They produced considerable amounts of humic acids when grown on lignin containing plant materials. Most of these fungi also produced humic acids if they were grown on a nutrient medium, containing glucose and a nitrogen\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Lncrna Neat1 promotes Il-8 expression in fibroblasts derived from COPD patients and in response to cigarette smoking\n", "abstract": " Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation and abnormal inflammatory response of the lung. The most important risk factor of COPD is cigarette smoke. Lung fibroblasts exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) increases the production of interleukin (IL)-8, a pro-inflammatory cytokine associated to disease progression. However, the mechanisms of IL-8 expression in COPD remain unclear. Recently, long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged being important in controlling numerous biological and pathological processes, and many lncRNAs are abnormally expressed in human disease. Nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is a lncRNA that promotes the expression of IL-8 (), but nothing is known about NEAT1 in COPD. We hypothesized that NEAT1 1 expression is increased in fibroblasts derived from COPD subjects compared with non-smoking\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Tunable TiO2 Nanotube Arrays for Flexible Bio-Sensitized Solar Cells\n", "abstract": " Highly ordered, free-standing titanium dioxide nanotube TiNT arrays have been of intense interest to the alternative energies field in recent years due to their barrier-free electron conduction pathway vs. TiO2 nanoparticles in dye-sensitized solar cell DSSC designs. TiNT arrays prepared by electrochemical anodization of Ti foils and combined with a transparent, Indium Tin Dioxide coated PET film are attractive candidates for efficient, flexible DSSCs. Flexible solar cells offer great benefits because of the potential for low-cost, roll-to-roll production and the increase in applications due to superior robustness. This approach utilizes a two-step anodization procedure coupled with implementation of a rapid inert gas dehydration and ultrasonic agitation detachment method. By controlling the reaction conditions during anodization voltage, duration, concentration, TiNT arrays with specific morphology, lengths, and diameters can be tailored to satisfy a particular application such as incorporating specialized protein dyes-in particular, bacteriorhodopsin. The free-standing arrays comprised of hexagonally closed-packed and regularly ordered TiNT membranes have been synthesized and detached from the original Ti substrate. Once the TiO2 sol-gel is created, the free-standing arrays will be attached to the flexible PET film for improved photovoltaic properties and overall performance.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

With the advent of Doppler radar and sophisticated tracking software, pitched and hit balls can be tracked throughout the trajectory in game conditions. The following considers drag measurements from balls hit in a game setting using a Doppler tracking system. The effects of spin, seam height, and velocity on drag were explored. The trends were compared to laboratory drag measurements from balls projected through still air. Balls with raised seams had, on average, higher drag than flat seam balls. Over speeds representative of play conditions, the ball drag coefficient decreased with increasing ball speed. It was also found that an increase in spin rate did not correlate to an increase in the drag coefficient.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Observational, cohort study in patients with NSCLC that was initially treated surgically in our hospital between October 1993 and September 1997. Thirty-two proteins were selected. The study consisted of the elaboration of tissue arrays with samples from resected tumour, using a semiquantitative immunohistochemical study. A prognosis analysis was done with the expression of each protein and calculation of the overall 5-year survival rate. The Wilcoxon-Gehan and Log-Rank tests were used for statistical comparisons, with p<. 05 being considered to indicate a significant result. RESULTS: One hundred and forty six patients were studied. The overall 5-year survival rate was 37.7%. From 32 proteins studied, three were statistically associated with overall 5-year survival rate. RB protein expression in resected NSCLC was a positive prognostic factor (P=. 01). P27 (P=. 03) and Ki67 (P=. 04) expression in resected NSCLC were negative prognostic factors. There was no protein with prognostic value in epidermoid tumours. CONCLUSIONS: We found three proteins with long-term prognostic value in the long-term in the general population and five adenocarcinoma prognostic proteins in our study of resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Immunosuppressive drugs (mainly thiopurines) and biological treatments (mainly monoclonal antibodies against TNFalpha) are currently most frequently and earlier used. The recent report of new cases of the rare and almost always fatal hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in young patients on combined therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and infliximab suggests that the optimal strategies for reducing increased risk of side-effects need to be urgently assessed. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We report the effects of stopping immunosupressants in four Crohn's disease patients previously treated with azathioprine and infliximab for 6-12 months as combined therapy. The appearance of infusion reactions due to immunogenicity and the loss of efficacy of infliximab are evaluated. RESULTS: No adverse events attributable to immunosuppression cessation or changes in infliximab efficacy have been noted during a 6-month evaluation period. CONCLUSIONS: Stopping immunosuppressant therapy in Crohn's patients with a previous good response to combination therapy (azathioprine and infliximab) does not result in an increased risk of adverse events or loss of infliximab efficacy. Our results must be confirmed in larger and longer studies. Until the pathogenic role of this combined therapy in the incidence of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is clearly defined, we consider that monotherapy with infliximab after a period on combined treatment is a safe and effective strategy.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

To improve the understanding of alcohol tribochemical reactions on an aluminum surface, friction tests followed by SIMS analyses were conducted. Deuterated alcohols were used to investigate the formation of bonds between the aluminum surface and alcohol molecules. The combination of SIMS analysis and the use of deuterated molecules have enabled us to propose a reaction mechanism between alcohols and the initial oxidized aluminum surface. This mechanism later affects the tribological behavior of the interface. In agreement with previous observations, we showed that a low steric size increases the number of acting molecules on the oxidized surface and that the alkyl chain length is of importance to protect the surface and hence reduce friction. These two key points can be easily explained by the proposed reaction pathway.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Steel purity in continuous casting tundishes\n", "abstract": " The requirements regarding the improvement of the quality of steel and performance achieved in ladle metallury lead us to consider the tundish not as a simple steel container but as a real metallurgical reactor capable of appreciably diminishing the impurities of the steel. To reach this target, solutions should take into account flow dynamics (movements defined by the form, dimensions and equipment of the tundish) and the physico-chemistry of the linings in contact with the steel. Hence, the idea of \"six surfaces of contact\" which must be imposed in order to develop a maximum reactive surface. Lime is the most reactive basic compound vs. the aluminous inclusions. The time steel travels in the tundish is long enough to allow the purifying reactions to be completed. The study of the purification in the tundish affects the following combinations: tundish walls--powder covering.

{"title": "Interleukin-4 enhances murine bone marrow macrophage M-CSF receptor expression by a posttranscriptional mechanism.\n", "abstract": " Activated T-lymphocytes secrete interleukin-4 (IL-4), which has been shown to modulate a variety of monocyte activities requiring monocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). To account for this interaction, we postulated that IL-4 acts on target cells by altering the expression of the M-CSF receptor (M-CSFr). To test this hypothesis, murine bone marrow macrophages were cultured under conditions that down-regulate M-CSFr and the effect of IL-4 on the reexpression of the receptor measured by binding of 125I-labeled M-CSF to the cells. The data show that incubation with IL-4 results in a dose-dependent, 2-3 x increase in M-CSFr with no change in binding affinity and a maximal effect on binding at about 12 h. This increase in M-CSFr is dependent upon new, specific protein synthesis as shown by the inhibitory action of cycloheximide, and gel analysis of radiolabeled, specific protein, immunoprecipitated with anti-M-CSFr antibody. Treatment with IL-4 does not stimulate M-CSFr mRNA expression but, consistent with enhanced receptor levels, does result in a heightened proliferative response to M-CSF. Thus, IL-4 affects M-CSF treated monocytic cells, at least in part, by altering the expression of M-CSFr.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Allosteric regulation of glycogen phosphorylase\n", "abstract": " Glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4. 1.1) catalyses the intracellular degradation of glycogen. The phosphorolytic cleavage of the a-1, 4 glycosidic bond at the non-reducing end of glycogen yields glucose-1-phosphate.(a-1, 4-glucoside) n+ Pi H (a-1, 4-glucoside) n-1+ Glc-1-P In muscle the reaction provides energy to sustain contraction and in liver the reaction provides fuel for other tissues. Phosphorylase is the archetypal control protein whose activity is regulated both by allosteric effectors and by reversible phosphorylation. The enzyme was discovered by Carl and Gerty Cori in 19361 who observed the formation of the unusual sugar phosphate ester in washed frog muscle extracts on incubation with phosphate. Work in the Coris' laboratory led to the identification of many of the regulatory properties including the important observation that phosphorylase from resting muscle was dependent on AMP for activity. However it was known that a form with AMP-independent activity existed and the explanation for this did not become available until 1955 when Edmond Fischer and Edwin Krebs2, 3 showed that this form of the enzyme had been activated by phosphorylation. This was the first description of control of an enzyme by reversible phosphorylation, a phenomenon now recognised as the most ubiquitous control mechanism for intracellular processes in biology. In 1964 Helmreich and Cori4 published kinetic details which showed that activation led to an increase in affinity of the enzyme for substrate (phosphate) and that binding of substrate increased the affinity for activators. These observations were included in the classical paper on allosteric\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The catalytic effect of metal ions on the hydrolysis of clavulanic acid\n", "abstract": " The metal (II)-ion-catalysed hydrolysis of clavulanic acid in water shows saturation kinetics. A 1:1 complex is formed between the metal ion and clavulanic acid, which is attacked by hydroxide ion ca. 2 \u00d7 106 times as fast as the unco-ordinated clavulanic acid. The catalytic effect produced by the copper(II) ion on the decomposition of the methyl ester of clavulanic acid shows a much smaller rate enhancement, indicating that the site of co-ordination for the clavulanic acid involves the ionized carboxylate group. The co-ordination sites of the clavulanic acid are the \u03b2-lactam nitrogen and the carboxylate group. The association constants between clavulanate ion and several transition metal ions have been determined. The order of rate enhancement brought about by the metal ion is CuII > ZnII > CdII > CoII > NiII > MnII.

Electrical field stimulation (ES) of isolated trachea pretreated with atropine and propranolol evoked reproducible relaxations that were blocked by tetrodoxin, but were unaffected by apamin. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), adenosine (AD), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of histamine (H)-induced contractions of isolated trachea but the inhibitory actions of these agents were not significantly affected by apamin. In contrast, apamin virtually abolished ES-evoked relaxations in guinea pig isolated taenia caeci, and reduced the inhibition of H-induced contraction by ATP from 40% to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Genistein diet also induced echocardiographic changes in function: in female hearts, 600G induced a 1.5-fold () increase in LVIDs, resulting in a significant decrease in FS and whole heart surface area when compared to controls (fed 0\u2009G). Genistein diet increased cardiac GLUT4 protein expression in both males (1.51-fold, ) and females (1.76-fold, ). However, no effects on the expression of notable intracellular signaling glucose uptake-regulated proteins were observed. Our data indicate that consumption of genistein diet for 4 weeks induces echocardiographic changes in indices of systolic function in females and has beneficial effects on cardiac GLUT4 protein expression in both males and females.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Purpose: This study examined the effects of a genistein-containing diet on cardiovascular plasma markers, aortic morphology, blood pressure, and expression of cardioprotective proteins in male and female mice.Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed either genistein diet (600 mg genistein/kg diet; 600G) or a genistein free diet (0G) for a period of 2 months. Results: After treatment, male and female mice fed 600G gained significantly less weight than their control counterparts fed 0G. Plasma insulin levels were significantly decreased in males only, whereas no changes in the other plasma markers were observed with 600G regardless of sex. Aortae from genistein-fed male mice demonstrated significant decreases in inner and outer luminal diameters and smooth muscle cell density. In female mice fed 600G, no changes in inner and outer luminal diameters were observed compared to female mice fed 0G, but smooth muscle cell density was significantly increased. Despite these differences in aortic morphology, no changes in arterial blood pressure were noted, regardless of sex or diet with genistein. Expression of cardiac glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) was increased in male hearts treated with genistein, while expression of endothelium nitric oxide synthase was significantly increased in females fed 600G compared to controls.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: 72 primary health care teams in Catalonia. PATIENTS: Patients over 64 years old with chronic diseases in home care programmes in Catalonia. MEASUREMENTS: Health status variables: Charlson, Barthel, Pfeiffer, Braden and Gijon, data from their carer (Zarit), self perception of health (SF-12), health professional visits, as well as: emergency visits, temporary admissions, and final results such as death or definitive admission in a nursing home or a hospital. RESULTS: A total of 1068 patients were included, 46.8% of the patients received some kind of social service, public or private. We observed that the variables related to receive some kind of social services are: high dependence (Barthel test), pressure sores and home care rehabilitation. Barthel test is highly associated with having social problems (Gijon test), living without an informal carer, more than 2 GP visits and having additional private health care. CONCLUSIONS: To be more fair, the evaluation of the provisions of the Dependence Law should also consider the health status of the patient. With the implementation of this law we can observe difficulties in access to social services for middle class patients. These patients do not have access to public social assistance and cannot pay for a private one. Social services are still an alternative to family care.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

In females of this species, there is substantial remodeling of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis controlling reproduction between gravid (egg bearing) and non-gravid states (White & Fernald, 1993). Moreover, female preference for male phenotype changes during the course of the reproductive cycle (Clement, Grens & Fernald, submitted). To understand what hormonal changes are associated with the behavioral and structural changes, we measured levels of several key hormones and peptides throughout the reproductive cycle of the female as a function of ovarian stage and development. We quantified plasma levels of testosterone and 17\u00df-estradiol using enzyme-linked immunoassays. The expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a hormone produced in the hypothalamus and involved in sexual maturation, was determined using quantitative real time RT PCR. In addition, the expression of two GnRH receptor types in the pituitary was also established using quantitative real time RT PCR. We relate the changes in hormonal profile to female affiliation preference to identify internal cues that might help orchestrate the shift to preference for dominant males.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

METHODS: 77 patients comprised the study; 33 with bladder cancer and 44 without. A urine sample was obtained from all patients for the BTA Trak test and another three samples for urinary cytology from each of the 33 patients with bladder cancer. Of the 44 patients without bladder cancer, 36 had conditions involving the urinary tract and 8 presented conditions without urothelial involvement. The BTA Trak test was repeated three months after treatment in 11 of the patients with bladder cancer and three months after the first test in 13 patients without bladder cancer. RESULTS: Using BTA Trak threshold values of 14 U/ml as first reference and 50 U/ml as the value indicating clinical warning, these were found to be higher in 24 of 33 patients with bladder tumor (sensitivity 72.7%). By tumor stage, BTA Trak was positive in 12 of 21 pT1 (sensitivity 57%) and in 11 of 11 pT2 (sensitivity 100%).

There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of LMP2 and LMP7 alleles between the patients with AS and the healthy controls.  We performed TAP1 and TAP2 typing at all polymorphic sites, including the recently described polymorphism at codons 648 and 651 in the TAP1 and TAP2 genes respectively.  Our analysis of the genetic polymorphism in the TAP genes failed to reveal significant differences between either total patient and healthy control groups or the patients and controls positive or negative for B27.In conclusion, the data of the present work suggest that the polymorphism of LMP and TAP genes do no have a major influence in the susceptibility to AS.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

RESULTS: The accumulated incidence of AIDS at the end of follow up was 56% with a mortality rate of 33%. The evolution showed statistically significant differences with regard to age (p= 0.00048) and previous treatment (p= 0.00239). No differences were observed concerning the type of hemophilia or its severity. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection in the cohort of hemophiliacs studied presented similar accumulated AIDS incidence and mortality to those described in other series of hemophiliacs. These values are apparently more favorable than those referred for other risk groups, possibly due to the particular epidemiologic characteristics.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Respiratory resistance (R) and elastance (E) were estimated continuously with a recursive least squares estimator. Three protocols were followed in which multiple histamine bolus injections were given 1 h apart. We found that the time courses of E and R had consistent patterns (transient peak that returned to baseline within 1000 sec) even in cases of low mean arterial pressure (MAP). Indomethacin pre-treatments prevented tachyphylaxis to repeated i.v. challenges. \u03b2-blockade produced a mild increase in baseline and a potentiation of the histamine-induced response in E and these effects were not altered with further \u03b1-or H2-blockade\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1574"]}
{"title": "Animal models of bronchial hyperreactivity\n", "abstract": " Airway responsiveness is increased in a variety of airway diseases. To understand the mechanism of enhanced airway responsiveness, in particular as it pertains to asthma, animal models have been developed and extensively explored. The guinea pig and Basenji-greyhound dog are the best characterized animals showing airways hyperresponsiveness and appear to bear substantial resemblances to asthmatic human subjects. Challenge with bronchoconstrictive agonist results in bronchoconstriction and transient vascular leak. Both phenomena contribute to the degree of airway narrowing. Adenosine challenge tests not only the responsiveness of the airways, but also that of the airway effector cells such as the mastocyte. Bradykinin and tachykinin cause indirect airway narrowing, probably by liberation of leukotrienes. Responsiveness can be enhanced by immune and non-immune challenges. Ozone, Sephadex, various contractile agonists (leukotriene D-4, bradykinin, platelet-activating factor), as well as certain cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, TNF-alpha) can enhance airway responsiveness. Cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase products appear to be involved. Allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness is associated with airway inflammation and appears to involve bradykinin and PAF acutely and growth of airway smooth muscle chronically.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

In the frame work of a ring lining scuffing and wear protection program, the anti-wear function of engine oils are mainly affected by the presence of four components the anti-wear additive (zinc dithiophosphate ZDDP), the detergent/dispersant system, the corrosive medium formed during combustion of residual fuels, and the abrasive medium with calamines, sludges and so on. Some of the preliminary studies required for the construction of the model have already been carried out. The first level is concerned with the bulk interactions of engine oils additives and products formed, they can be classified according to the different processes involved (physical chemistry, acid/base interaction, complex chemical reaction with heterogen phasis, etc.),(see table 1).

Focusing on the incipient global legal framework for both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) arbitration, this paper explores whether current due process or consumer protection laws might be preventing the creation of an international system of binding low-value online ODR. Intending to stimulate innovation in this nascent industry, evaluation is made of the unsuccessful efforts to develop a transnational online arbitration model at the United Nations Commission on Trade Law, the newly launched European Union online dispute resolution platform, and the extant Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy.  Through comparison of EU and US approaches to mandatory consumer arbitration clauses, it questions whether such clauses would need to become enforceable ex ante before an international consumer arbitration system can ever be fully fledged. It also explores the minimum procedural requirements for low-value B2B and B2C arbitration and, as such, may be of great interest to dispute resolution entrepreneurs, professionals and regulators wishing to capitalise on the growing millions of high-volume low-value cross-border legal claims not being internally managed by online intermediaries or service providers.

As ADSB operates at the same frequency as many other standardised aeronautical applications, it is necessary to estimate whether ADSB messages collisions in orbit will prevent having realtime aircraft position information as required by the GADSS from the ICAO. A simulator was developed to estimate a maximum collision probability of position messages sent from civil aviation aircrafts. Using several assumptions that suggest the worst scenario possible, the simulation was run, and the distribution of several results were averaged. Even in the worst case, the probability to receive a message within one minute is 99.9985%. Those results shown that the reception of ADSB signals onboard satellites is feasible, even in areas with high traffic density, archiving ICAO standards.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Forest harvest effects on mercury in European perch\n", "abstract": " Previous studies done on water chemistry found that clear-cutting forests increases methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations. In recent years, few studies have been conducted on what effect forestry operations have on mercury (Hg) concentrations in biota, more specifically on fish. Predictions were made that Hg concentrations would increase by 10-25% in fish after clear-cutting. In order to determine if the predictions were accurate, a study was done on the effects of Hg in perch after clear-cutting around six study lakes throughout Sweden between the years 2010-2013. Fish samples were taken before (2010) and after (2011 and 2013) the clear-cutting took place. There was a significant increase in Hg concentration in relation to fish size. There was an increase of 10% in fish Hg overall post-harvest, when length, weight, and age were used as covariates in the analysis of clear-cut effects. The lakes with higher clear-cut areas within their catchments were also higher in mean Hg concentration ([Hg]) post-harvest, whereas the lakes with the lowest clear-cut areas were found lower in mean [Hg] post-harvest. These results are consistent with previous studies done on biota,water, and soil in boreal lake catchments. These findings give insight on how forest harvest can have a negative impact on the surrounding catchments and on the lake fish Hg  concentrations. Further studies should be conducted on the role of the bacteria, zooplankton, and nitrogen isotopes within these catchments to better explain how Hg is released and methylated after forest harvest, moving from the water into the aquatic food web.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Feature-Based Discovery of Services with Adaptable Behaviour\n", "abstract": " Service discovery is one of the corner stones of Service-Oriented Architectures. It aims at finding the set of services which comply with a query in a scalable way with regard to the number of services in the registry. Current approaches to service discovery are based on registries (like UDDI) which provide efficient search algorithms over the interfaces (described in WSDL) and metadata of the services, or are focussed on ontology matching mechanisms over semantic descriptions of the services (e.g., OWL-S). However, these approaches rarely support searching over stateful services (such as those described as Windows Workflows or BPEL processes) based on behavioural queries or, when they do, they perform the behavioural analysis on a second step, due to its computational complexity, and then they discard the services which present deadlocks or live locks.

{"title": "A case study in model-based adaptation of web services\n", "abstract": " Developing systems through the composition of reusable software services is not straightforward in most situations since different kinds of mismatch may occur among their public interfaces. Service adaptation plays a key role in the development of such systems by solving, as automatically as possible, mismatch cases at the different interoperability levels among interfaces by synthesizing a mediating adaptor between services. In this paper, we show the application of model-based adaptation techniques for the construction of service-based systems on a case study. We describe each step of the adaptation process, starting with the automatic extraction of behavioural models from existing interface descriptions, until the final adaptor implementation is generated for the target platform.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Symptoms of unstable angina had first recurred 8 weeks after surgery when repeat angiography revealed proximal occlusion of the radial graft at the site of anastomosis with the LIMA. The distal segment of the radial graft was patent with retrograde flow from the RCA to the distal circumflex artery (Cx). The LIMA graft was patent although flow was poor. Stenting of the left main and the proximal Cx arteries and the diagonal branch was performed with good angiographic results and an improvement in symptoms. Unfortunately, pain recurred 6 months later and repeat angiography demonstrated occlusion of the left main stent, improved flow in the LIMA, and persistent retrograde flow from the RCA to the Cx via the patent distal radial graft. Antegrade angioplasty of the left main coronary occlusion was attempted, but the guidewire could not be passed.

This diffusion mimics natural soil respiration and can allow an independent verification of the accuracy of soil respiration measurement systems. By placing the soil respiration system to be tested on top of the porous layer of the flux generation system, deviations from a 1: 1 relationship can be measured.

To this end, three areas exhibiting autochthonous vegetation were chosen: Valdelatas (with Quercus ilex) and Soto del Real and Valsafn (with Q. pyrenaica). These locations had been respectively reafforested with Pinus pinea, P. pinaster and P. sylvestris. Differences were noted in the structure and composition of the arthropod communities studied. Comparisons were made of the numbers of individuals, the number of species, the Shannon-Weaver diversity index and the Margalef richness index. There were generally fewer species and individuals in the rea: fforestations than in the adjacent zones where the natural vegetation is conserved. The data also yielded lower values of the MargaJ. ef index, which expresses the changes in the fauna provoked by the reafforestation better than the Shannon-Weaver index. From the point of view of conservation, the loss of diversity was less in those rea: fforestations where the understorey is maintained. In reafforested areas, populations were reduced and species with lower biological potential, usually those that were rare or endemic in such areas, tended to disappea.

Lower than normal MCV was found in 162 children (5.74%), who were grouped as follows: thalassaemia, 15 cases (0.53%), Hb Lepore, 8 cases (0.28%), iron deficiency, 77 cases (2.73%), atypical microcytosis, 55 cases (1.95%), and structural variants 7 cases (0.24%). These variants were further identified as HbS (3), Hb Hofu (1), in natives, and HbC (3) in children from Morocco. Higher prevalence of anomalies was seen in some places: Riolobos, 1.5%, Galisteo, 2.5%, Jaraiz de la Vera, 3.02%; a significant group of Hb Lepore carriers was detected in this last town. The prevalence of abnormalities seen in some small towns or villages grants this type of programmes as such places, which could be considered as isolated communities, might provide a number of high-risk couples.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "The relevance of mortality due to circulatory system diseases in Spain\n", "abstract": " Cardiovascular diseases is the first cause of death in Spain, as it occurs in most western countries, with a crude death rate of 306 per 100,000 inhabitants in the male population and 351 in the female population in 1987. While this represented a 44.9% of all death causes in 1976, it represented a 42.6% in 1987. Death due to cardiovascular diseases, once corrected for the aging population, has decreased at a yearly rate of 1.26% in males and 1.6% in females from 1968 to 1987 (last year with available date). Most part of the decrease is due to a mean annual decrease of 3% in cerebrovascular mortality since the mid 70s, followed by a reduction in coronary deaths, slightly above 1% annually, since approximately the same time. The changes in life style that have taken place, together with medical and surgical advances and the influence of other factors which have not been so widely studied could be responsible for the potential saving of over 12,000 deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, which would have been added to those occurred in 1987 if mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases had been the same as in 1976. The difficulty to assign a quantified degree of responsibility changes constitutes a research challenge, not discrediting the preventive action on this facts which are already known.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The realisation of the undulator consisted of several steps: mechanical construction, magnets sorting and magnetic field measurements with the associated computed trajectory and spontaneous emission spectrum for one electron through the field.

{"title": "Deaths attributable to tobacco consumption in Spain\n", "abstract": " Spain is one of the European countries with greater prevalence of tobacco consumption among general population. In order to encourage the implementation of tobacco consumption reduction programmes, the number of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases and chief cancer localizations attributable to tobacco consumption in Spain were calculated by epidemiologic methods. Estimates suggest that, in 1983, 39.816 tobacco related deaths occurred, which accounted for 13% of total deaths reported during that year. The four tobacco related diseases producing the greatest number of deaths were ischemic cardiopathy (10.821 deaths), bronchopulmonary cancer (8.337 deaths), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.473 deaths), and acute cerebrovascular accident (6.636 deaths). These results suggest that tobacco consumption is the isolated cause responsible of the greatest number of deaths in Spain, whose control must become a priority objective in our health policy.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

However, this survival benefit is modest and mCRC ultimately progresses. The underlying mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy remains unclear. Recent preclinical studies have shown that anti-angiogenic therapy increases collagen expression in tumors as a consequence of hypoxia. The extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in solid stress-induced blood vessel collapse as they transmit the mechanical stress created by proliferating cells within the confined space of a tumor. In this study, we investigated the effects of anti-angiogenic therapy on extracellular matrix expression, both collagenous and non-collagenous and perfusion as a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to anti\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}
{"title": "Abstract A45: Obesity-induced inflammation and desmoplasia promote pancreatic cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy\n", "abstract": " Introduction: With the current epidemic of obesity, the majority of pancreatic cancer patients are overweight or obese at diagnosis. Importantly, obesity worsens treatment outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that underlie the poorer prognosis of obese cancer patients is of paramount importance. Obesity causes inflammation and fibrosis in the normal pancreas due to the accumulation of dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes. Importantly, desmoplasia\u2014a fibro-inflammatory microenvironment\u2014is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and we have shown that activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) via angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1) pathway is a major contribution to tumor desmoplasia. Whether obesity affects inflammation, PSCs and desmoplasia in PDACs, and interferes with delivery and response of chemotherapeutics is currently unknown\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

BCP has contributed new insights across temporal and spatial scales into how ancient climate and environmental change have shaped faunas, emphasizing processes of assembly, persistence, and diversification across the vast Beringian region. BCP collections also represent baseline records of biotic diversity from across the northern high latitudes at a time of accelerated environmental change. These specimens and associated data form an unmatched resource for identifying hidden diversity, interpreting past responses to climate oscillations, documenting contemporary conditions, and anticipating outcomes for complex biological systems in a regime of ecological perturbation. Because of its dual focus on hosts and parasites, the BCP record also provides a foundation for comparative analyses that can document the effects of dynamic change on the geographic distribution, transmission dynamics, and emergence of pathogens. By using specific examples from carnivores, shrews, lagomorphs, rodents and their associated parasites, we demonstrate how broad, integrated field collections provide permanent infrastructure that informs policy decisions regarding human impact and the effect of climate change on natural populations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

These efforts often failed to consider the lived experiences of teachers and school administrators who have worked with Indigenous students and communities. Earlier studies that sought the input of professionals experienced in Indian education largely reported these professionals emphasized the importance of utilizing culturally relevant pedagogy, curriculum and school leadership approaches that have proven effective to advance academic performance of Indigenous students (Cleary & Peacock, 1998; Huffman, 2008, 2013). This chapter builds on this knowledge and reports on findings from interviews with five experienced Navajo educators in the United States and four experienced First Nations educators (one non-Indigenous) in Saskatchewan, Canada. These interviews provide information on mainstream American and Canadian perspectives for educational reform as compared to the views about the types of instruction and curriculum Indigenous students need according to these nine experienced school administrators working with schools serving Indigenous students.North American Indigenous students lag academically behind their non-Indigenous peers (Native Americans, 2013).

In  this  paper,  we  are  interested  in  MDO  problems  having  at  least  two  conflicting  objectives. This characteristic ensures the existence of a set of compromise solutions called Pareto front.  We treat those MDO problems like Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problems. Actual MOO methods suffer from certain limitations, especially the necessity for their users to adjust various parameters.  These adjustments can be challenging, requiering both disciplinary and optimization knowledge.  We propose the use of the Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems technology in order to automatise the Pareto front obtention. ParetOMAS (Pareto Optimization Multi-Agent System) is designed to scan Pareto fronts efficiently, autonomously or interactively.

{"title": "Genetic aspects of vasculitis\n", "abstract": " The publication of recent genome-wide association studies is substantially increasing the understanding of human diseases with a complex genetic component. Vasculitides, which are characterized by inflammatory damage of the blood vessels, are a good example of this type of disorder. They show a very complex etiology in which both environmental and genetic factors seem to contribute to the predisposition and clinical phenotype of the disease. During the last decade, a large number of genetic studies, genome-wide association studies in some cases, have been performed on vasculitides and, strikingly, most of the identified risk loci shared susceptibility factors amongst them. This reinforces the idea that some immunological pathways are key players in the major hallmarks of these diseases.However, since the current knowledge of the genetic basis of the vasculitides is often based on studies performed in few population, further collaborative studies on larger cohorts are required to provide the last pieces of the genetic puzzle underlying vasculitides, giving us a better perspective of their etiopathogenesis and allowing novel approaches for the development of more effective therapies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Dermatology Procedural and Surgical Skills Workshop for Medical and Physician Assistant Students\n", "abstract": " Background: Evidence indicating the limited amount of hands-on experience in the current era of medical training has raised concern regarding students\u2019 development and potential deficiencies in the performance of basic procedural skills. Studies have demonstrated the value of surgical workshops for medical students; however evaluation of improved student performance during future clerkships or residencies has yet to be assessed. We initiated and evaluated a resident-led surgical skills workshop for students through the Department of Dermatology. Methods: Participants received instructions on surgical tools/techniques followed by hands-on practice. Anonymous surveys administered to 24 medical and physician assistant students assessed their skill level, confidence level, and likelihood of using surgical skills in future practice pre-and post-workshop using a 1-5 Likert scale. Overall experience was also assessed. Non-parametric bivariate tests were used for analysis to account for non-normal distribution of the data. Results: There was a statistically significant change in skill (p= 0.0001) and confidence (p= 0.0001) level post workshop. There was no significant difference in utility. There were also no statistically significant differences based on the year of medical student training, medical student versus physician assistant student responses, or number of procedures performed prior to the workshop. Estimated cost per participant was $5.65. Conclusions: Research supports our finding that workshop learning experiences increase students\u2019 ability to perform common procedural skills, their confidence, and desire to practice such skills.

{"title": "Class separation improvements in pixel classification using colour injection\n", "abstract": " This paper presents an improvement in the colour image segmentation in the Hue Saturation (HS) sub-space. The authors propose to inject (add) a colour vector in the Red Green Blue (RGB) space to increase the class separation in the HS plane. The goal of the work is the development of an algorithm to obtain the optimal colour vector for injection that maximizes the separation between the classes in the HS plane. The chromatic Chrominace-1 Chrominance-2 sub-space (of the Luminance Chrominace-1 Chrominance-2 (YC1C2) space) is used to obtain the optimal vector to add. The proposal is applied on each frame of a colour image sequence in real-time. It has been tested in applications with reduced contrast between the colours of the background and the object, and particularly when the size of the object is very small in comparison with the size of the captured scene. Numerous tests have confirmed that this proposal improves the segmentation process, considerably reducing the effects of the variation of the light intensity of the scene. Several tests have been made in skin segmentation in applications for sign language recognition via computer vision, where an accurate segmentation of hands and face is required.

Purified diets containing 0.15, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg selenium in the form of sodium selenite were fed to female A/J mice. Half of the mice in each dietary group were exposed to cigarette smoke six hours a day for five months followed by a four month recovery period in ambient air, while the other half were used as controls. After the recovery period, the mice were euthanized, and their lungs and livers were removed for further analysis. The lung tissue was analyzed for tumor incidence, multiplicity, and selenium level while glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was quantified in liver tissue. Mice exposed to smoke had a higher tumor incidence. Mice fed 2.0 ppm Se had a slightly lower tumor incidence than mice fed 0.5 ppm Se.

{"title": "Synthesis and Analysis of Adaptors through Security Contracts\n", "abstract": " Security is considered to be one of the main challenges as regards the widespread application of Service Oriented Architectures across organisations. WS-Security, and its successive extensions, have emerged to fulfil this need, but these approaches hinder the loose-coupling among services, therefore constraining their reusability and replaceability. Software adaptation is a sound solution to overcome the incompatibilities in interface, behaviour and security constraints among stateful services. Adaptation contracts successfully express in a concise manner how to overcome the incompatibilities between secure services. However, most of the work in the literature do not provide the means to generate full-blown adaptors from contracts through an analysable synthesis process. Furthermore, traditional algorithms for adaptor synthesis are comparable to common model checking and simulation techniques in their approach and complexity. Therefore, the state-space of the system was usually explored at least twice: once to generate the adaptor and another to verify the adapted system. In this work, we propose a new approach to generate security adaptors from adaptation contracts. This approach allow us to prove desirable properties, such as deadlock and livelock freedom, by construction of the adaptor, avoiding the computational cost of subsequent verification and simulation phases.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}
{"title": "Assimilating AmeriFlux Site Data into the Community Land Model with Carbon-Nitrogen Coupling via the Ensemble Kalman Filter\n", "abstract": " The assimilation of terrestrial carbon, water and nutrient cycle measurements into land surface models of these processes is fundamental to improving our ability to predict how these ecosystems may respond to climate change. A combination of measurements and models, each with their own systematic biases, must be considered when constraining the nonlinear behavior of these coupled dynamics. As such, we use the sequential Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to assimilate eddy covariance (EC) and other site-level AmeriFlux measurements into the NCAR Community Land Model with Carbon-Nitrogen coupling (CLM-CN v3. 5), run in single-column mode at a 30-minute time step, to improve estimates of relatively unconstrained model state variables and parameters.

{"title": "Immunohistochemical and biochemical characteristics of BSE and CWD in experimentally infected European red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus)\n", "abstract": " Background The cause of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in the United Kingdom (UK) was the inclusion of contaminated meat and bone meal in the protein rations fed to cattle. Those rations were not restricted to cattle but were also fed to other livestock including farmed and free living deer. Although there are no reported cases to date of natural BSE in European deer, BSE has been shown to be naturally or experimentally transmissible to a wide range of different ungulate species. Moreover, several species of North America's cervids are highly susceptible to chronic wasting disease (CWD), a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) that has become endemic. Should BSE infection have been introduced into the UK deer population, the CWD precedent could suggest that there is a danger for spread and maintenance of the disease in both free living and captive UK deer populations. This study compares the immunohistochemical and biochemical characteristics of BSE and CWD in experimentally-infected European red deer (Cervus elpahus elaphus). Results After intracerebral or alimentary challenge, BSE in red deer more closely resembled natural infection in cattle rather than experimental BSE in small ruminants, due to the lack of accumulation of abnormal PrP in lymphoid tissues. In this respect it was different from CWD, and although the neuropathological features of both diseases were similar, BSE could be clearly differentiated from CW", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

We present a 74 year-old male who was admitted to the Nephrology Department with a diagnosis of exacerbated chronic renal failure that required emergency hemodialysis. He went to the Hospital because of malaise, asthenia, diarrhea and nausea in the last five months. He had been evaluated at the Gastroenterology Department for 3 months and the creatinine value was 2 mg/dL. On physical exam he was pale, had cardiac arrhythmia, basal pulmonary hypoventilation, jugular ingurgitation, hepatomegaly, and edemas in both legs. In blood analysis anemia, thrombocytopenia, nitrogen retention (Creatinine 13 mg/dL) and metabolic acidosis were detected. ESR, IgM gammaglobulin and Kappa chains values were also elevated. A \u00abrouleaux\u00bb phenomenon was seen. In urine there was no excretion of light chains. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy disclosed infiltration of lymphocytes with plasmacytoid differentiation. The immunological study by means of flow cytometry was compatible with lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma. Renal biopsy showed: 22 histologically normal glomeruli and 3 sclerosed glomeruli. There was infiltration of the interstitium with small size atypical lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells, which markedly widened the renal interstitium (fig. 1).

{"title": "The management of azoospermic patient\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVES: Since first pregnancy after ICSI was achieved in 1992, the treatment and prognosis of severe male factor, ie azoospermia, has radically changed. The objective of this article is to review the issue from the urologist-andrologist point of view. METHODS: We perform a short revision of the two types of azoospermia and diagnostic tests, and show the algorithm used in our centre for the management of patients with azoospermia. We review the techniques for spermatozoid recovery and surgical treatment of obstructive azoospermia because the role of the urologist is maximum in these aspects. Genetic anomalies in azoospermic patients is one of the issues analyzed in more detail for being one of the most important and of maximum interest currently. RESULTS: Nearly 1% of pregnancies in developed countries are achieved by assisted reproduction techniques, and genetic anomalies among newborns from ICSI cycles have increased to 1.6%, three times normal population. Genetic anomalies are tenfold in azoospermic patients in comparison to general population. We analyze the importance of these studies in patients with secretory azoospermia. We review the most frequent genetic anomalies associated with azoospermia and diagnostic tests employed. Its importance is based on this diagnosis allowing genetic counselling and pre-implant or prenatal diagnosis with the aim of trying to minimize genetic anomalies and disease transmission to next generations. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis and treatment of azoospermia continues to be one of the most thrilling challenges in the field of infertility, with promising research lines such as in\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

METHODS: Observational prospective naturalistic study with a cohort of 343 ambulatory patients during 6 months. We collected socio-demographic, clinical and lung function variables. The HRQL was assessed by means of a generic scale (SF-36) and a specific one (Marks's AQLQ). RESULTS: They were evaluated 268 patients (78%). mean age 48.6 years (SD 16.28), 64.15% women. Women and the subjects with worse socioeconomic situation had poor basal HRQL scores. During the follow-up an average improvement in FEV1 of 0.26 l (SD 0.44; p< 0.001) was observed. The average change in the AQLQ was-1.92 (-2.09-1.75) being the larger improvement in the breathlessness domain. The average change in SF-36 was 5.13 (4.75-5.51) for physical standardized component and 5.23 (4.83-5.63) for mental component.

These languages which are also referred to as fourth generation languages (4GLs) therefore play an important role in today's economy. Incompatibilities between different versions of 4GLs and changing requirements may make massive changes on a company's library of 4GL programs necessary.

{"title": "School Governance in Rural Communities: The Role of the Board of Trustees Chairperson in Small New Zealand Schools.\n", "abstract": " In the 11 years since the devolution to local control of New Zealand schools, the role of the Board of Trustees chairperson has emerged as critical to the success of the school-community partnership, especially in small rural communities. A qualitative study examined the issues facing the Board chair, as a lay, elected school leader working in partnership with the school principal. Interviews were conducted with two male and two female chairpersons, all farmers having at least 4 years experience as trustees. Participants had a combined total of 25 years experience as trustees and 17 years experience as Board chairs. In each school, the principal was a teaching principal. Findings suggest that the job of the Board chair increases as school size decreases. Smaller schools have a smaller pool of available trustees and available expertise in the area of governance. In smaller schools, the principal must spend more time in the classroom teaching, has less time to devote to educational leadership, and therefore depends more on the Board chair. In addition, the intimacy of interpersonal relations is greater in smaller schools and communities, making some decisions and conflicts personally more difficult. Hornby's model of parental involvement in'school governance is discussed, and it is suggested that the model needs substantial modification to address the unique characteristics of small rural schools.(Contains 21 references..)(Author/SV)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The number of activities of MS (NMS) carried out in all the units, was picked up during one year, and a model of lineal regression was built. The independent variable was the NMS, and the explanatory ones the assistance pressure (AP), the postgraduate formation (PF), the staff of the unit, the equipment (E), and the carried out CE.Results: The valuation of the CE had a median of 8 (with interquartile range 1), 85.1% of the people who realized CE in MS said that this would be of utility. However in the explanatory regression model the PF was the only significant variable (beta= 6.7; 95% CI, 0.12-12.22).

The diagnosis was made by DRE, transrectal US and histological confirmation by transrectal biopsy. PSA values were normal. Studies to determine the extent of the lesion showed advanced locoregional dissemination. Surgery was therefore not indicated and hormonal therapy was administered. Patient outcome was poor with no apparent clinical response to hormone blockade. Radiotherapy was attempted. The patient rapidly became worse and died. CONCLUSIONS: Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate is characterized by the presence of significant amounts of extra and intracellular mucin. Its clinical features are not unlike those of classical adenocarcinoma and in general terms, it is considered to carry a worse prognosis and refractory to hormone therapy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

{"title": "Towards evidence-based public health?\n", "abstract": " Evidence-based public health can be viewed as a way of facing community health problems by which the decisions are taken accordingly to the available evidence. A complete multidisciplinary approach should be introduced, with the goal of identifying and articulating the different dimensions which are present when trying to respond to the challenges or problems for the people's health. In addition to clinical medicine, disciplines such as epidemiology, biostatistics, health services research, economics, behavioural sciences, demography, nutrition, gerontology or computing sciences, among others, may contribute to health promotion and disease prevention. This open approach should not be exempt of a captious attitude toward the obtainable information, while it is essential to have a comprehensive spirit to combine this information with the previous experience and the peculiarities of each situation. Searching for evidence begins with a clear operational statement of the problem. This helps to select and obtain the key pieces of information. The information obtained must be judged critically, and related to the specifics of the problem. Lastly, it should be accepted that search for evidence does not mean finding certitude.

Its trajectory is specifically designed to optimize the time spent in the current layers and to minimize radiation damage to the spacecraft. Observations are concentrated in the region 8 to 40 R (sub E) The mission consists of three phases. After a launch into geostationary transfer orbit the orbits are circularized to probe the region between geostationary orbit and the magnetopause; next the orbit is elongated keeping perigee at the magnetopause while keeping the line of apsides down the tail. Finally, once apogee reaches 40 R (sub E) the inclination is changed so that the orbit will match the profile of the noon-midnight meridian of the magnetosphere. This mission consists of 4 solar electrically propelled vehicles, each with a single NSTAR thruster utilizing 100 kg of Xe to tour the magnetosphere in the course of a 4.4 year mission, the same thrusters that have been successfully tested on the Deep Space-1 mission.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

The potential impact of population and individual strategies for controlling cholesterolemia in Spain\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND: The aim of the application of population and individual strategies for the control of cholesterolemia recommended by several commissions of experts in Spain is to obtain marked decreases in mortality by ischemic heart disease. This study is the first to estimate the potential benefits obtained by the application of both strategies in males from 35 to 64 years of age in Spain. METHODS: Upon fixing the population dietetic aims for the ingestion of fats and cholesterol, the foreseen decrease in mean serum cholesterol was estimated by predictive equations. For individuals at risk, more ambitious objectives were made in regard to decrease in cholesterolemia. The consequent reduction of coronary death risk was obtained for each strategy comparing the foreseen coronary risks by logistic functions for previous serum cholesterol values and those posterior to the health intervention. RESULTS: The population decrease of saturated fat to 7-10% of total calories of the diet and of the consumption of cholesterol to 300 mg/day would produce a reduction of serum cholesterol of between 6.5 and 21.4 mg/dl (0.2-0.6 mmol/l) which would represent nearly 200 mg/dl (5.2 mmol/l). This would then produce a decrease in coronary deaths of 5.5 to 17.1%. This population strategy must reach 934 to 2,857 people per death avoided. With the individual strategy, the reduction of 55 mg/dl (1.4 mmol/l) in mean cholesterolemia of subjects with more than 250 mg/dl (mean 7.1 mmol/l) or of 36 mg/dl (0.9 mmol/l) in those with more than 200 mg/dl (mean 6.2 mmol/l) would produce a decrease of population coronary death between 3.3 and 12.5% in the first group\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

To estimate the distribution and the concentration of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in Estonian ecosystems, samples of mushrooms, mosses, lichens and the upper horizons of soil were gathered from 63 test sites during 1991. We were particularly interested in the amounts of radionuclides in mushrooms because these are used as food by people. Dangerously high radionuclide concentrations were found in mushrooms gathered in North-East Estonia. Heightened concentrations were registered here and there all over the territory of Estonia, especially in mushrooms gathered in Central and South-Western Estonia. The Cs-137 content in mushrooms depends on its content in other components of the ecosystems, first and foremost on the concentrations of radiocaesium in mosses and litter, which, therefore, can be used as indicators in prognostication the radioactive pollution of mushrooms in a certain region. As Cs-137 migrates between various ecosystem components, it is necessary to check the radioactivity of the forest products used for food for still a number of years to come.

This has several implications. Firstly, clubbing has become a sign of a change in the megakaryocyte-platelet axis. Our data show that megakaryocytes are larger in patients with carcinoma of the lung than in controls. 2 Platelets have no nuclei and only residual amounts of mRNA. Platelet PDGF is determined by megakaryocyte mRNA for PDGF Therefore, clubbing might be a sign of altered synthetic capacity by megakaryocytes in carcinoma of the lung (and other diseases where it occurs). Secondly, Fox and colleagues\u2019 finding is indirect evidence that platelet production results from fragmentation of megakaryocyte cytoplasm in the pulmonary circulation.\u2019In clubbing one could postulate that activated megakaryocytes and megakaryocyte cytoplasmic particles pass from the pulmonary arterial circulation into the systemic circulation via abnormal circulation around lung tumours or chronic pulmonary inflammation. In cyanotic congenital heart disease, this may occur via right to left shunts. Thirdly, their finding might throw some light on the role of platelets in atherogenesis. Atherosclerosis is a proliferative disease of the vessel wall in which PDGF has been implicated. Evidence has been presented that the initial arterial wall proliferation is secondary to the occlusion by platelets of vasa vasorum in the vessel wall. These vessels are the same size as those Fox and colleagues found to contain platelets in clubbing.

This potentiation of the drugs' effects is similar to that seen with the rat isolated hemidiaphragm prep-aration, when in the absence of insulin there was no significant increase in glucose uptake (Kirby & Turner, 1974a, b, c). Turtle & Burgess (1973) found that insulin-dependent diabetics had a less marked response to the action of fenfluramine in lowering blood glucose levels than control subjects.

This thesis attempts to re-examine the actual facts with regard to Churriguera's life and work; during recent years several reliable writers brought to light new information which throws doubts on many of the dates usually given for Churriguera's buildings and this new evidence suggests too that he needs an entirely new family history. Working from these valuable  references whioh have been acknowledged in the text, the writer has reconsidered all the available evidence with regard to Jose de Churriguera's life and work he has examined a number of original documents and has examined during several visits to Spain, all the work under discussion.  The first section illustrates by means of references to existing texts, the growth of an entirely fictitious Jose de Churriguera. The section continues with an attempt to build up the actual facts and supports these by references to original documents; the original documents prove that Jose de Churriguera's birth actually occurs some time after the date originally given.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1574"]}

Humans can be infected with all 3 types, though influenza C is rare compared with influenza A and B. Influenza A is classified into subtypes based on two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Influenza B is not classified as subtypes; however, both influenza A and B are further classified into strains. Influenza viruses are highly dynamic and continuously evolve by antigenic drift or antigenic shift. Antigenic drift is a gradual evolution and occurs through point mutations in surface antigens, which produces new strains that may not be recognized by antibodies from previous strains. As a result, global surveillance is critical in monitoring the evolution of strains in an effort to keep the influenza vaccine up-to-date.
