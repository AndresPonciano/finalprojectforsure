{"title": "Using extreme value theory for vehicle level safety validation and implications for autonomous vehicles\n", "abstract": " Much effort is put right now into how to make autonomous vehicles as capable as possible in order to be able to replace humans as drivers. Less focus is put into how to ensure that this transition happens in a safe way that we can put trust in. The verification of the extreme dependability requirements connected to safety is expected to be one of the largest challenges to overcome in the commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Using traditional statistical methods to validate complete vehicle safety would require the vehicle to cover extreme distances to show that collisions occur rare enough. However, recent research has shown the possibility of using near-collisions in order to estimate the frequency of actual collisions using Extreme Value Theory. To use this method, there is a need for a measure related to the closeness of a collision. This paper shows that the choice of this threat measure has a significant impact\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["2270"]}

If the decision to intervene is made too early, the intervention can become a nuisance to the driver, and if the decision is made too late, the safety benefits of the intervention will be reduced. The decision to intervene is commonly based on a threat function. The dimensionality of the input state space for the threat function is, in general, very large, making exhaustive evaluation in real vehicles intractable. This paper presents a method for efficient estimation of a conservative bound on CA system performance, i.e., the worst-case performance. Closed-form expressions are derived for the worst-case performance, in terms of early or unnecessary interventions, with regard to longitudinal or lateral prediction and measurement errors.

{"title": "Reliable vehicle pose estimation using vision and a single-track model\n", "abstract": " This paper examines the problem of estimating vehicle position and direction, i.e., pose, from a single vehicle-mounted camera. A drawback of pose estimation using vision only is that it fails when image information is poor. Consequently, other information sources, e.g., motion models and sensors, may be used to complement vision to improve the estimates. We propose to combine standard in-vehicle sensor data and vehicle motion models with the accuracy of local visual bundle adjustment. This means that pose estimates are optimized with regard not only to observed image features but also to a single-track vehicle model and standard in-vehicle sensors. The described method has been experimentally tested on challenging data sets at both low and high vehicle speeds as well as a data set with moving objects. The vehicle motion model in combination with in-vehicle sensors exhibit good accuracy in estimating\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["2270"]}

There is a complicated relation between the confidence of what hinders that might exist coming out of an environment perception block, and the tactical decisions about the driving style done by the autonomous vehicle. A good strategy that enables safety assessment according to ISO26262 implies that the environment perception block should address its safety requirements for all the ASIL attribute values simultaneously.

In this paper we argue that the introduction of self-driving cars can solve this ethical dilemma. In short the solution to the trolley problem is that a self-driving car must be able to estimate its own operational capability for handling surprising situations, and adjust its own tactical behavior accordingly. By limiting the risk for the case of not being able to handle all surprising events in a similar way as for other safety goals today, the remaining risk for the trolley problem can be argued as low as any other acceptable risk of vehicle E/E implemented functionality.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["2270"]}

Already for today\u2019s manually driven road vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), it is far from trivial how to argue that the sensor systems are sufficiently capable of enabling a safe behavior. In this paper, we argue that the transition from ADAS to automated driving systems (ADS) enables new solution patterns for the safety argumentation dependent on the sensor systems. A key factor is that the ADS itself can compensate for a lower sensor capability, by for example lowering the speed or increasing the distances. The proposed design strategy allocates safety requirements on the sensors to determine their own capability. This capability is then to be balanced by the tactical decisions of the ADS equipped road\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["2270"]}
