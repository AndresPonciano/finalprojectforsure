The most recent assembly of hexaploid bread wheat recovered the highly repetitive TE space in an almost complete chromosomal context and enabled a detailed view into the dynamics of TEs in the A, B, and D subgenomes. The overall TE content is very similar between the A, B, and D subgenomes, although we find no evidence for bursts of TE amplification after the polyploidization events. Despite the near-complete turnover of TEs since the subgenome lineages diverged from a common ancestor, 76% of TE families are still present in similar proportions in each subgenome. Moreover, spacing between syntenic genes is also conserved, even though syntenic TEs have been replaced by new insertions over time, suggesting that distances between genes, but not sequences, are under evolutionary constraints. The TE composition of the immediate gene vicinity differs from the core intergenic regions. We find the same TE families to be enriched or depleted near genes in all three subgenomes. Evaluations at the subfamily level of timed long terminal repeat-retrotransposon insertions highlight the independent evolution of the diploid A, B, and D lineages before polyploidization and cases of concerted proliferation in the AB tetraploid.

The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza A virus highlights the importance of pigs in influenza emergence, particularly as intermediate hosts by which avian viruses adapt to mammals before emerging in humans. Although segment reassortment has commonly been associated with influenza emergence, an expanded host-range is also likely to be associated with the accumulation of specific beneficial point mutations. To better understand the mechanisms that shape the genetic diversity of avian-like viruses in pigs, we studied the evolutionary dynamics of an Eurasian Avian-like swine influenza virus (EA-SIV) in na\u00efve and vaccinated pigs linked by natural transmission. We analyzed multiple clones of the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) gene derived from consecutive daily viral populations. Strikingly, we observed both transient and fixed changes in the consensus sequence along the transmission chain. Hence, the mutational spectrum of intra-host EA-SIV populations is highly dynamic and allele fixation can occur with extreme rapidity. In addition, mutations that could potentially alter host-range and antigenicity were transmitted between animals and mixed infections were commonplace, even in vaccinated pigs. Finally, we repeatedly detected distinct stop codons in virus samples from co-housed pigs, suggesting that they persisted within hosts and were transmitted among them.

While numerous sources of Type 2 resistance have been reported, relatively fewer Type 1 resistances have been characterised. Previous study identified a Type 1 FHB resistance (QFhs.jic-4AS) on chromosome 4A in Triticum macha. Little is known about the effect of combining Type 1 and Type 2 resistances on overall FHB symptoms or accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON).

Recent work has extended this approach to the quantification of diversity within otherwise difficult-to-study metazoan groups. However, nuclear ribosomal genes present both analytical challenges and practical limitations that are a consequence of the mutational properties of nuclear ribosomal genes. Here we exploit useful properties of protein-coding genes for cross-species amplification and denoising of 454 flowgrams. We first use experimental mixtures of species from the class Collembola to amplify and pyrosequence the 5\u2032 region of the COI barcode, and we implement a new algorithm called PyroClean for the denoising of Roche GS FLX pyrosequences. Using parameter values from the analysis of experimental mixtures, we then analyse two communities sampled from field sites on the island of Tenerife. Cross-species amplification success of target mitochondrial sequences in experimental species mixtures is high; however, there is little relationship between template DNA concentrations and pyrosequencing read abundance. Homopolymer error correction and filtering against a consensus reference sequence reduced the volume of unique sequences to approximately 5% of the original unique raw reads. Filtering of remaining non-target sequences attributed to PCR error, sequencing error, or numts further reduced unique sequence volume to 0.8% of the original raw reads. PyroClean reduces or eliminates the need for an additional, time-consuming step to cluster reads into\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["839"]}

{"title": "A carbohydrate-binding protein, B-GRANULE CONTENT 1, influences starch granule size distribution in a dose-dependent manner in polyploid wheat\n", "abstract": " In Triticeae endosperm (e.g. wheat and barley), starch granules have a bimodal size distribution (with A- and B-type granules) whereas in other grasses the endosperm contains starch granules with a unimodal size distribution. Here, we identify the gene, BGC1 (B-GRANULE CONTENT 1), responsible for B-type starch granule content in Aegilops and wheat. Orthologues of this gene are known to influence starch synthesis in diploids such as rice, Arabidopsis, and barley. However, using polyploid Triticeae species, we uncovered a more complex biological role for BGC1 in starch granule initiation: BGC1 represses the initiation of A-granules in early grain development but promotes the initiation of B-granules in mid grain development. We provide evidence that the influence of BGC1 on starch synthesis is dose dependent and show that three very different starch phenotypes are conditioned by the gene dose of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["839"]}
{"title": "Genome-wide transcription during early wheat meiosis is independent of synapsis, ploidy level, and the Ph1 locus\n", "abstract": " Polyploidization is a fundamental process in plant evolution. One of the biggest challenges faced by a new polyploid is meiosis, particularly discriminating between multiple related chromosomes so that only homologous chromosomes synapse and recombine to ensure regular chromosome segregation and balanced gametes. Despite its large genome size, high DNA repetitive content and similarity between homoeologous chromosomes, hexaploid wheat completes meiosis in a shorter period than diploid species with a much smaller genome. Therefore, during wheat meiosis, mechanisms additional to the classical model based on DNA sequence homology, must facilitate more efficient homologous recognition. One such mechanism could involve exploitation of differences in chromosome structure between homologues and homoeologues at the onset of meiosis. In turn, these chromatin changes, can be expected to be linked to transcriptional gene activity. In this study, we present an extensive analysis of a large RNA-Seq data derived from six different genotypes: wheat, wheat-rye hybrids and newly synthesized octoploid triticale, both in the presence and absence of the Ph1 locus. Plant material was collected at early prophase, at the transition leptotene-zygotene, when the telomere bouquet is forming and synapsis between homologues is beginning. The six genotypes exhibit different levels of synapsis and chromatin structure at this stage; therefore, recombination and consequently segregation, are also different. Unexpectedly, our study reveals that neither synapsis, whole genome duplication nor the absence of the Ph1 locus are associated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["839"]}
{"title": "A co-expression network in hexaploid wheat reveals mostly balanced expression and lack of significant gene loss of homeologous meiotic genes upon polyploidization\n", "abstract": " Polyploidization has played an important role in plant evolution. However, upon polyploidization the process of meiosis must adapt to ensure the proper segregation of increased numbers of chromosomes to produce balanced gametes. It has been suggested that meiotic gene (MG) duplicates return to a single copy following whole genome duplication to stabilize the polyploid genome. Therefore, upon the polyploidization of wheat, a hexaploid species with three related (homeologous) genomes, the stabilization process may have involved rapid changes in content and expression of MGs on homeologous chromosomes (homeologs). To examine this hypothesis, sets of candidate MGs were identified in wheat using co-expression network analysis and orthology informed approaches. In total, 130 RNA-Seq samples from a range of tissues including wheat meiotic anthers were used to define co-expressed modules of genes. Three modules were significantly correlated with meiotic tissue samples but not with other tissue types. These modules were enriched for GO terms related to cell cycle, DNA replication and chromatin modification, and contained orthologs of known MGs. Overall 74.4 % of genes within these meiosis-related modules had three homeologous copies which was similar to other tissue-related modules. Amongst wheat MGs identified by orthology, rather than co-expression, the majority (93.7 %) were either retained in hexaploid wheat at the same number of copies (78.4 %) or increased in copy number (15.3%) compared to ancestral wheat species. Furthermore, genes within meiosis-related modules showed more balanced\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["839"]}

{"title": "New insights into homoeologous copy number variations in the hexaploid wheat genome\n", "abstract": " Bread wheat is an allohexaploid species originating from two successive and recent rounds of hybridization between three diploid species that were very similar in terms of chromosome number, genome size, TE content, gene content and synteny. As a result, it has long been considered that most of the genes were in three pairs of homoeologous copies. However, these so-called triads represent only one half of wheat genes, while the remaining half belong to homoeologous groups with various number of copies across subgenomes. In this study, we examined and compared the distribution, conservation, function, expression and epigenetic profiles of triads with homoeologous groups having undergone a deletion (dyads) or a duplication (tetrads) in one subgenome. We show that dyads and tetrads are mostly located in distal regions and have lower expression level and breadth than triads. Moreover, they are enriched in functions related to adaptation and more associated with the repressive H3K27me3 modification. Altogether, these results suggest that triads mainly correspond to housekeeping genes and are part of the core genome, while dyads and tetrads belong to the Triticeae dispensable genome. In addition, by comparing the different categories of dyads and tetrads, we hypothesize that, unlike most of the allopolyploid species, subgenome dominance and biased fractionation are absent in hexaploid wheat. Differences observed between the three subgenomes are more likely related to two successive and ongoing waves of post-polyploid diploidization, that had impacted A and B more significantly than D, as a result of the evolutionary\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["839"]}
{"title": "Next generation sequencing enabled genetics in hexaploid wheat\n", "abstract": " Abstract Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is providing new methodologies to improve and complement traditional genetic approaches. These strategies, collectively termed NGS-enabled genetics, consist of identifying variation in bulks of plants that have been assembled based on a specific phenotype of interest. We examined NGS-enabled genetics in hexaploid wheat by using near isogenic lines (NIL) differing across a specific disease resistance locus. RNA-Seq of NILs allowed the identification of SNPs across this locus and helped distinguish allelic SNPs from homoeologous variants. F 2 bulks were assembled based on opposing disease resistance phenotypes and the frequency of the informative allelic SNPs was examined across bulks using RNA-Seq. Variants enriched in the corresponding bulks are expected to be most closely linked to the phenotype of interest and were prioritized for validation. Recent advances in cereal genomics in the form of wheat gene models, sequenced diploid progenitors, and the advances in the Chromosome-based Survey Sequencing Project enabled us to develop a pipeline to automatically design SNP-based markers. These high-throughput assays were used to genotype the original individuals used to assemble the bulks and to generate a genetic map across the target locus.

{"title": "Rust expression browser: an open source database for simultaneous analysis of host and pathogen gene expression profiles with expVIP\n", "abstract": " Transcriptomics is being increasingly applied to generate new insight into the interactions between plants and their pathogens. For the wheat yellow (stripe) rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) RNA-based sequencing (RNA-Seq) has proved particularly valuable, overcoming the barriers associated with its obligate biotrophic nature. This includes the application of RNA-Seq approaches to study Pst and wheat gene expression dynamics over time and the Pst population composition through the use of a novel RNA-Seq based surveillance approach called \u201cfield pathogenomics\u201d. As a dual RNA-Seq approach, the field pathogenomics technique also provides gene expression data from the host, giving new insight into host responses. However, this has created a wealth of data for interrogation. Here, we used the field pathogenomics approach to generate 538 new RNA-Seq datasets from Pst-infected field wheat samples, doubling the amount of transcriptomics data available for this important pathosystem. We then analysed these datasets alongside 66 RNA-Seq datasets from four Pst infection time-courses and 420 Pst-infected plant field and laboratory samples that were publicly available. A database of gene expression values for Pst and wheat was generated for each of these 1024 RNA-Seq datasets and incorporated into the development of the rust expression browser (                   http://www.rust-expression.com                                    ).

The aim of this PhD was to develop bioinformatics tools that help answer biological questions relevant to research and breeding by addressing the complexities associated with the wheat genome. I took advantage of resources which became publicly available as the analyses were carried out and I developed new approaches, strategies and tools to help accelerate wheat research. Chapter 1 reviews the genomic resources used for the thesis, placing them in historic context with the work and analyses performed. Chapter 2 describes the development of PolyMarker, a bioinformatics pipeline to design genome-specific primers in a timely and effective manner. Examples of different applications of PolyMarker are also included. Chapter 3 describes the analysis of an F2 population to generate a genetic map for Yr15, a gene that provides resistance to yellow rust. The SNP calling was done from bulked segregating samples, sequenced with RNASeq as a method of reduced representation. Chapter 4 describes expVIP, a tool to integrate RNA-Seq experiments in a relational database. Data from different studies can be visualised simultaneously, enabling comparisons between them. Lastly, in Chapter 5 all the data types used for the analysis on each of the previous chapters is integrated into a relational database.
