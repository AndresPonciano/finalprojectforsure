However, it is possible to find interesting associations with a high confidence level hut with little support. This problem is caused by the way support is calculated, as the denominator represents the total number of transactions in a time period when the involved items may have not existed. If, on the other hand, we limit the total transactions to the ones belonging to the items' lifetime, those associations would be now discovered, as they would count on enough support. Another difficulty is the large number of rules that could be generated, tbr which many solutions have been proposed. Using age as an obsolescence tactor for rules helps reduce the number of rules to be presented to the user.

In such situations technologically outstanding software systems can be built, but they may fail to suit the needs of the client. Hence, clients are unsatisfied and development projects fail.

These new requirements are posed either by customers or they are the consequence of users\u2019 feedback about the application. One of the main problems when dealing with new requirements is their consistency in relationship with the current version of the application. In this paper we present an effective approach for detecting and solving inconsistencies and conflicts in web software requirements. We first characterize the kind of inconsistencies arising in web applications requirements and then show how to isolate them using a model-driven approach.

In some cases, users access the Web with native mobile applications developed for well-known sites, such as, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. These native applications might offer further (e.g., location-based) functionalities to their users in comparison with their corresponding Web sites because they were developed with mobile features in mind. However, many Web applications have no native counterpart and users access them using a mobile Web browser. Although the access to context information is not a complex issue nowadays, not all Web applications adapt themselves according to it or diversely improve the user experience by listening to a wide range of sensors. At some point, users might want to add mobile features to these Web sites, even if those features were not originally supported.

In response to new or changing requirements, additional code is developed and existing one is properly modified. When new requirements are temporary, ie, when they specify some volatile functionality that is expected to be online only for some time and then removed, the additions and changes are destined to be later rolled back. This way to proceed, apart from being time and effort demanding, by involving the intrusive editing of the application\u2019s source code, brings along the risk of polluting it and introducing mistakes. In this paper, we present an approach to deal with volatile functionality in Web applications at the presentation level, based on oblivious composition of Web user interfaces. Our approach, which is inspired by wellknown techniques for advanced separation of concerns such as aspect-oriented software design, allows to clearly separate the design of the application\u2019s core user interface from the one corresponding to more volatile functionality. Both core and volatile user interfaces are oblivious from each other and can be seamlessly composed using a transformation language. We show that in this way we simplify the application\u2019s evolution by preventing intrusive edition of the user interface code.

OOHDM explicitly separates navigation from user interface design; this means that design decisions related with the navigational topology of the application are (in a broader sense) independent respect to those regarding interface issues (See for example [Schwabe96, Schwabe98]). Separating navigational from user interface design allows us to define different interfaces for the same navigation structure and maximize modularity.We have mined many patterns that show recurrent design problems and their solutions both while developing the navigational architecture of the application and when building its user interface [Rossi96, Rossi97, Rossi99, Lyardet99]. The patterns contained in this paper belong to the hypermedia design pattern language that we have developed while mining patterns for web applications for some years.

A simple example is used to point out some situations in classic Web engineering modeling where it is not possible to express that objects or nodes should change their properties (attributes or behaviors) according to the collaborating subject (the objects which send them messages or the nodes which are linked to them). Next, we introduce the object-oriented role concept and discuss how it has been used so far in the software engineering community and how it can be useful for Web engineering modeling.

{"title": "A collaborative approach to describe the domain language through the Language Extended Lexicon\n", "abstract": " Software development is a succession of descriptions in different languages in which every description is based on a previous one. Since the requirements specification is one of the first descriptions, it is important to begin software development with requirements that are as correct and as complete as possible. Although some literature holds the belief that correctness and completeness are two attributes that requirements specifications must satisfy, we know that these attributes are very difficult to meet. However, we have to find ways to diminish the level of incompleteness and deal with the possible conflicts that do arise in the requirements context. Defining the domain language before specifying the requirements is a way of coping with these problems. Nowadays, software systems involve many stakeholders and it is hard to engage all of them to produce a domain language specification. We rely on collaboration to foster the involvement and cooperation of the stakeholders, thus they are able to explore the differences constructively and provide a common understanding of the domain language beyond their own limited views. In this paper, we propose a strategy to capture the domain language in a collaborative way using the Language Extended Lexicon and we show a validation of the proposed strategy.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1453"]}

At the same time recommender systems have become powerful tools to improve personalization on the Web. Yet, many popular websites lack this functionality, eg, for missing financial incentive. Therefore, we present a novel approach to empower user script developers to build more personalized augmenters by utilizing collaborative filtering functionality as an external service. Thus, script writers can build recommender systems into arbitrary websites, in fact operating across multiple website domains, while guarding privacy and supplying provenance information. This paper discusses the architecture of the proposed approach, including real-world application scenarios, and presents our tool kit and publicly available prototype. The results show the feasibility of combining Web augmentation with recommender systems, to empower the crowd to build new kinds of applications for a more personalized browsing experience.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1453"]}

Currently, most users bring constantly their smartphones and other devices with them, especially millennials. For that reason, some approaches try to solve this portabilization, generating certain improvements. However, in the majority of these solutions there is not a direct participation of users; do not consider their visual identity, analysis of feeling or mining of opinion. This paper proposes getting the behavior web application model with Markov heuristics from the widgets closeness matrix, prior to adaptation in order to include the user logic.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1453"]}

Beyond merely representing the syntax, hypertext can be used to provide various views of a single program code. Nevertheless, to reap the benefits of this technique, adequate hypertextual editors must be built.

{"title": "A Collaborative Approach to Capture the Domain Language.\n", "abstract": " Software development is a succession of descriptions in different languages where a previous description is necessary for the next one. Thus, it is important to begin software development with requirements that are as correct and as complete as possible. Although some literature holds the belief that correctness and completeness are two attributes that requirements specifications must satisfy, we know that these attributes are very difficult to meet. However, we have to find ways to diminish the level of incompleteness and deal with the possible conflicts that do arise in the requirements context. Defining the domain language before specifying the requirements is a way of coping with this problem. Nevertheless, it is hard to produce a domain language specification when there are many stakeholders involved. We rely on collaboration in order to foster the cooperation of the stakeholders, thus they are able to explore the differences constructively and search for solutions that go beyond their own limited views.

When unexpected and unforeseen requirements appear, the changes pose challenges to software engineers as they were not considered in the application design and such new functionality can be only valid only for a period in certain situations. This work presents a comparison of maintenance consequences in the software quality when using a Model\u2010Driven approach against a Code\u2010Based one where changes are managed in an ad hoc way. We used the removal of volatile functionality as case of study due to the fact that its characteristics stress the development process. We considered both external and internal quality of deliverables. For assessing the quality of deliverables, we evaluated the production of more than 35 students using both approaches considering their perception gathered through questionnaires and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}
{"title": "Towards fast metamodel evolution in LiquidML\n", "abstract": " The software industry is applying Model-driven development approaches due to a core set of benefits, such as raising the level of abstraction and reducing coding errors. However, their underlying modeling languages tend to be quite static, making their evolution hard, specifically when the corresponding metamodel does not support primitives and/or functionalities required in specific business domains. This paper presents an extension to the LiquidML language to support fast metamodel evolution by allowing experts to abstract new language concepts from primitives while supporting automatic tool evolution and zero application downtime. To probe our claims, we evaluate the evolutionary capabilities of existing modeling languages and LiquidML in a real world language extension.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}
{"title": "Identifying functional requirements inconsistencies in multiteam projects framed into a model-based methodology\n", "abstract": " REP (Requirements Engineering Process) is one of the most essential processes within the software project life cycle because it allows describing software product requirements. This specification should be as consistent as possible to enable estimating in a suitable manner the effort required to obtain the final product. REP is complex in itself, but this complexity is greatly increased in big, distributed and heterogeneous projects with multiple analyst teams and high integration among functional modules. This paper presents an approach for the systematic conciliation of functional requirements in big projects dealing with a modelbased approach. It also explains how this approach may be implemented in the context of NDT (Navigational Development Techniques) methodology and finally, it describes a preliminary evaluation of our proposal in CALIPSOneo project by analyzing the improvements obtained with our approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}
{"title": "LiquidML: A Web Modeling Language Supporting Fast Metamodel Evolution\n", "abstract": " Model Driven development approaches are being adopted by the software industry due to a core set of benefits such as raising the level of abstraction and reducing coding errors. However, their underlying modelling languages tend to be quite rigid, making their evolution hard, specifically when the corresponding metamodel do not support primitives and/or functionalities required in specific business domains. In this work, we present an approach for fast evolution of the modelling language that is \u201cself reflective\u201d, allowing modellers to abstract new language concepts from the primitives. The main advantage of our approach is that it provides zero application downtime and automatic tool evolution. As a consequence, applications created with our approach are able to adapt quicker to the business needs than those based on traditional Web modelling languages. We compare our approach with existing modelling languages in a case study providing a proof of its ability to adapt faster than to new business needs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}
{"title": "Enactive sketches for designing enactive interactions\n", "abstract": " The role of sketching for designing enactive interactions is reviewed, a conceptual framework is described and an exploratory case study is analyzed and discussed. The framework is organized as a map with two dimensions: the first one expresses the interactivity embodied in the different representations used by designers. The other dimension organizes the user experience expressiveness achieved by the different sketches. The sketch categories are linked through the attributes of interactivity sought by the designer. The case study supports the need to include some form of interactive sketching for designing of enactive interactions..", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}

{"title": "Managing volatile requirements in web applications\n", "abstract": " Web applications allow business to offer services or products to numerous users with different culture, context, and needs. There are situations where applications must adapt to unforeseen and temporary business requirements, such as a one-off market campaign to launch a new product, beta features for engaging users, or disaster solidarity features that remain in the application for a period of time. In this paper, we summarize an approach for dealing with this sort of volatile requirements and present challenges in the research field that must be addressed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}
{"title": "TICCWL: a tool to identify crosscutting concerns through the LEL approach\n", "abstract": " Software applications are complex systems that involve a myriad of different concerns. These concerns can usually be organized into different separated modules, but most of the times they overlap and crosscut each other. Such a situation is problematic because concerns are tangled and scattered across different modules, and design and source code are difficult to produce and maintain under this circumstance. The Aspect-Oriented Software Development community propose to solve the problem of crosscutting concerns by performing separation of concerns. This separation must be done as soon as possible in software construction in order to avoid the reworking of artifacts during development, as this rework means investing effort on a task already finished and it also poses the risk of introducing mistakes. Approaches that identify crosscutting concerns are generally complex and deal with a lot of information\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}

{"title": "Use of hypermedia tools for end-user development\n", "abstract": " Software development tools aimed at end-users tend to employ various forms of visual programming because these users find textual programming very difficult to learn. However, visual programming has known scalability issues. As an alternative, we propose hypertextual programming; a technique that represents the program as hypertext and allows the user to both browse it and manipulate it mainly by using navigation. This technique leverages the users\u2019 ability to navigate in hyperspace, a widely available skill, to edit the program under development. In order to reap the benefits of this technique, adequate hypertextual editors must be built. Many of the lessons learned in the web engineering area can be used to deal with this problem. This paper discusses the state of the current research efforts behind this novel programming technique.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1453"]}

{"title": "Improving Web Applications Evolution by Separating Design Concerns\n", "abstract": " In this paper we discuss how to improve the evolution of Web software by using different strategies for separation of design concerns. We first motivate our work by briefly presenting the different kinds of evolution problems that software developers face when dealing with business Web applications. Then we briefly describe our experience in the conception of a mature design method, the Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Method (OOHDM), and in the development of a design model for designing business processes in Web applications (UWAT+). We show how we have dealt with design problems by using different abstraction and decoupling mechanisms and analyze the impact of our design choices in the evolution of target Web applications.
