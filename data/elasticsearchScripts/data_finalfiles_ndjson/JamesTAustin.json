We focus first on the variety of research designs and substantive issues to which SEM can be applied productively. We then discuss a number of methodological problems and issues of concern that characterize some of this literature. Although it is clear that SEM is a powerful tool that is being used to great benefit in psychological research, it is also clear that the applied SEM literature is characterized by some chronic problems and that this literature can be considerably improved by greater attention to these issues.", "num_citations": "3376\n", "authors": ["1028"]}

Research on goals has accumulated sporadically through research programs in cognition, personality, and motivation. Goals are defined as internal representations of desired states. In this article, the authors review the theoretical development of the structure and properties of goals, goal establishment and striving processes, and goal-content taxonomies. They discuss affect as antecedent, consequence, and content of goals and argue for integrating across psychological content areas to study goal-directed cognition and action more efficiently. They emphasize the structural and dynamic aspects of pursuing multiple goals, parallel processing, and the parsimony provided by the goal construct. Finally, they advocate construct validation of a taxonomy of goals.", "num_citations": "3017\n", "authors": ["1028"]}
{"title": "Understanding and managing cynicism about organizational change\n", "abstract": " Executive Overview Change is all about us, but many of its targets remain cynical about its impact and importance. Cynicism about organizational change often combines pessimism about the likelihood of successful change with blame of those responsible for change as incompetent, lazy, or both. Data from a new empirical study, and from previously published research, suggest numerous factors that contribute to the development of such cynicism. These include a history of change programs that are not consistently successful, a lack of adequate information about change, and a predisposition to cynicism. Results also suggest that cynicism about changes has negative consequences for the commitment, satisfaction and motivation of employees.", "num_citations": "1290\n", "authors": ["1028"]}

{"title": "Developing motivation\n", "abstract": " Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain the initiation, direction, intensity, and persistence of behaviour, especially goal-directed behaviour (Brophy, 1998). Motivation theorists working within education contexts seek to understand why some students become successful learners while others, of seemingly equal ability, do not. Since the 1970s, there has been a paradigmatic shift from motivation theories that emphasize biology (instincts, needs, drives) or behaviour (extrinsic rewards/punishments used to condition responses) to theories that recognize the role of personal cognition and social context (Pintrich & Schunk, 2002). Socio-cognitive theorists consider motivation to be largely a mentalistic or purposive process, rather than a mechanistic or reactive process. Behavioural indications of motivation include whether or not children choose to become music participants, the amount of effort they expend in their musical pursuits, and the degree to which they persevere across time.", "num_citations": "166\n", "authors": ["1028"]}

Those authors distinguished three definitions of the dynamic criterion phenomenon and concluded, on the basis of secondary analyses of several sets of published data, that dynamic criteria do not exist. Moreover, they concluded that most of the temporal changes in criteria reported in those data sets could be explained by methodological artifacts. In several cases these artifacts were listed in summary form, without a complete consideration of the implications of invoking these artifacts as post hoc explanations. The purpose of this comment is to clarify the debate on dynamic criteria by critiquing the Barrett et al. study. We suggest that a fruitful solution to the problem may lie in trying to understand criteria per se rather than searching for artifacts.", "num_citations": "110\n", "authors": ["1028"]}

There are a variety of specific self-regulation theories, including control theory, task goal theory, social cognitive theory, and Kanfer and Ackerman's multiple resource allocation model.

An empirical study is reported to illustrate how these various approaches can be implemented to meet the accountability challence in the No Child Left Behind era. Consistency analysis of 12 standard-setting procedures reveals vastly disparate pass/fail decisions among different procedures, even within the same conceptual framework or mapping operation.

This centrality exists for several reasons. Several stakeholder groups use information on individual job performance. Organizations use performance data to validate selection decisions and as a predictor of future performance for subsequent compensation or promotion decisions. Among those decisions are layoffs, promotions, discharge, merit pay, or some combination (Martin, Bartol, & Kehoe, 2000). Importantly, it also happens that the practice of PA is a source of controversy and litigation (Bowman, 1999). Recent changes in the conceptualization and practice of performance appraisal have also captured a fair amount of attention and further propelled PA onto the center stage among human resources management functions (Taylor & Pierce, 1999; Bernardin, Hagan, Kane, & Villanova, 1998).Contemporary thinking regarding the practice of performance assessment in organiza-tions has expanded beyond the traditional confines of performance measurement to embrace a more proactive management of performance (Banks & May, 1999). Performance management is the moniker in vogue today to describe this more holistic and continuous process to maintain and foster individual performance. In addition to performance measurement practices, performance management (PM) includes a host of ancillary performance support activities such as feedback, coaching\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1028"]}
{"title": "Evaluating Credentialing Systems: Implications for Career-Technical Educators.\n", "abstract": " In this paper, occupational or industry-based credentialing is considered from the perspective of the policymaker in career-technical education (CM). A credential is awarded to an individual who meets prederermined qualifications maintained by a credentialing body (Browning, Bugbee & Mullins, 1996; Schmitt, 1995; Shimberg, 1981). The qualifications usually are a combination of education, experience, and test scores. Ananda and Rabinowitz (1995) and Losh (2000) have noted that standards and occupational credentials can be important features of the CTE domain. Policymakers considering the adoption of credentialing might view the intended consequences as increasing access to occupations, signaling competence on the part of graduates, and demonstrating responsiveness of the educational system. Briefly, providing access refers to developing an alternative route by which individuals can enter the labor market, signaling competence refers to documenting capabilities of CM graduates, and demonstrating responsiveness refers to signaling at the level of the educational or employment system. On the other hand, there may be unintended and less desirable consequences of adopting credentials.A selected set of examples helps to triangulate the current importance of credentialing. At the national level, the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) is a strong advocate of certification as an integral part of its skill standards initiatives. In various publications, the NSSB has advocated bottomup development of assessment-credentialing systems by voluntary partnerships (NSSB, 2000b, 2001b).

In industrial, work and organizational (IWO) psychology, one could argue, as some have, that Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg was the first important person in industrial psychology and deserves credit for developing the field (Landy, 1992); if established, it could be easily justified that Wilhem Wundt deserves credit because he was M\u00fcnsterberg\u2019s German mentor, whereas others could credit William James as being influential and prescient because he brought M\u00fcnsterberg over to the US, where one could argue that applied psychology was bound to thrive. Others could argue that individuals were not important, but that the general development of psychology along with the needs of expanding businesses would eventually have led to IWO regardless of whether M\u00fcnsterberg had ever been born or migrated to the US. When the topic is a history of IWO across North America (defined geographically as Canada and the United States), slipperiness and mythology increase because of long-term interrelationships among the two nations.

This paper presents lessons learned from the state of Ohio's multi-year program to develop a standards-based assessment system for programs delivering state-funded early childhood education (ECE) through programs receiving public dollars such as the federally funded Head Start and state- funded preschool programs. Its program, called the Ohio Indicators of Success Initiative (IOS), was designed to collect data that could be used to improve the quality of state-funded ECE programs in Ohio and to hold these programs accountable for child outcomes.

{"title": "Using advanced statistics\n", "abstract": " O ne\u2019s research questions or specific hypotheses should be the key in determining what statistical analyses will be employed in a particular study. In general, research questions may be broken into four categories: degree of relationship among variables, significance of group differences, prediction of group membership, and finally structure (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). In this chapter, we discuss each of these four categories of analysis, as well as the types of research questions associated with each (see Table 20.1). Before pursuing these advanced statistical techniques, we will begin with the notion of statistical power because this is one of the most important issues in research design and analysis, yet one of the most neglected. A full treatment of power analysis can be found in Chapter 11.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1028"]}
{"title": "PROGRAM EVALUATION\n", "abstract": " Concepts and Perspectives organizations, educational institutions, etc.), in the course of their work, might be called on to evaluate an activity or a program whether or not they have been trained as evaluators or have indepth comprehension of it. Davidson (2002), for instance, shows how this could occur for industrial-organizational psychologists. They are there in the situation, and they have had methodological training, so they must be able to do it. Essentially, this is a reason by default. Secondly, evaluation has a number of unique methodological and substantive content areas that would be useful for psychologists to understand and be able to use in their work. A third answer is that some psychologists will undoubtedly lead or participate in evaluations as their main professional focus. Therefore, the purposes of this chapter are to provide an overview of the nature of evaluation, to define it conceptually, to show its relationship to research, and to give a sense of what might have to be done to conduct an evaluation. Specifically, the chapter is organized as follows: Some background related to defining evaluation is described; defining evaluation with a comparison of evaluation and research, based on the definition, comes next; and implications of the definition for practice and generic types of", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1028"]}
{"title": "High-Stakes Testing: Implications for Career and Technical Education. The Highlight Zone: Research@ Work.\n", "abstract": " The topic of high-stakes testing (HST) is important because HST has direct and indirect effects on career-technical education (CTE) programs and timely because HST increasingly enters public discussion and has produced a large body of research and practice that generalizes to CTE. A review of HST has identified two persisting dilemmas: policy and public expectations of testing exceeding tests' technical capacities and tension between testing to increase fairness and testing to classify. Applicable strategies to provide validity for HST are reliability estimation of scores used to make decisions, expert judgements of item linkage to curricula, studies of the predictive power of HST scores, and studies of consequences. Two opposing perspectives on the accountability-testing theme are that use of HST for accountability is a positive application of data-driven management to education and that the consequences of HST are negative. Descriptions of HST systems in Kentucky, Texas, and Massachusetts indicate different ways to accomplish HST; use of advisory panels to represent stakeholders' viewpoints; and continuous change. Findings of an e-mail survey of state CTE directors suggest ways to expand assessment modalities--computer delivery of assessments and authentic assessments or multimodal assessments that include high-and low-stakes components. Implications are that the CTE community, needs awareness of HST; tests should be used responsibly; and a useful database system should be developed.(Contains 76 references and a list of 8 Internet sites.)(YLB)", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1028"]}
{"title": "Technology and Assessment. In Brief: Fast Facts for Policy and Practice No. 5.\n", "abstract": " The process of assessment in career and technical education (CTE) is changing significantly under the influence of forces such as emphasis on assessment for individual and program accountability; emphasis on. the investigation of consequences of assessment; emergence of item response theory, which supports computer adaptive testing; and pressure for authentic assessment by critics of standardized testing. The use of technology for. assessment is being increasingly stressed. Potential advantages of computerized assessment include rapid feedback, money savings, enhanced security, more curriculum time, and capability to track process-oriented variables. Potential disadvantages include costs of equipment, personnel, and training; increased marginalization of groups based on ethnic or socioeconomic status; and missed opportunities to implement authentic assessments. Examples of applications of technology to evaluation in CTE include test design, item creation, presentation, item scoring, and location (through use of the Internet). In moving toward computerized assessment, consequences should be considered in line with current evaluation and validation models. Especially for policy makers and administrators, implementation is an important aspect of computerized assessment. Technology can support the broad changes in assessment that are ongoing as a function of internal and external scrutiny, and both authentic as well as traditional assessment can benefit from technology.(Contains 24 references.)(KC)", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1028"]}

A review by Louis and Jones (2001) examined the breadth of information related to dissemination and utilization of that knowledge in general, and then specifically to CTE. Research on dissemination seeks to investigate and understand the flow of information from researchers to practitioners, and recently has added loops from practitioners back to the researchers. An interdisciplinary domain has evolved around the issues of research dissemination and utilization (RDU) of scientific products and services.
