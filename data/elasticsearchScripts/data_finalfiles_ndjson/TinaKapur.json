This approach emphasizes the role of four complementary kinds of knowledge or models in medical segmentation: intensity models that describe the gray-level appearance of different tissues, imaging models that describe the characteristics of the imaging process, geometric models that describe the spatial relationships between structures, and shape models that describe the shapes of individual structures.We instantiate this approach in a novel Bayesian method for segmentation of Magnetic Resonance images. This method uses Expectation-Maximization to iteratively estimate the classification of an input image. Intensity models and geometric models are formulated as probability distributions, and are used as priors in the Bayesian classification. A well-known imaging model is used to account for the inhomogeneities due to the MR acquisition process. A Gibbs model is used to impose piecewise homogeneity of tissue class, which reduces the fragmentation effects in the segmentation that are caused by the presence of thermal noise in MR. Geometric relationships are described as spatially varying probability distributions on geometric primitives such as distances and normals that relate pairs of structures, and are constructed from segmented training data.", "num_citations": "90\n", "authors": ["895"]}

These scans are typically acquired as standard of care for PCa staging, but are generally ignored by the segmentation algorithms. Our method is based on a multi-stream 3D convolutional neural network for the automatic extraction of isotropic high resolution segmentations from MR images.

Use of the iGyne in AMIGO includes the following steps 1) CAD models of the interstitial template and vaginal obturator are loaded, 2) MR scan of the patient with the template sutured to the perineum and the obturator placed in the vaginal canal is transferred to 3D Slicer using the DICOM protocol, 3) an initial rigid registration is computed from 3 corresponding point pairs provided by the user on the template holes, 4) the registration is refined using the Iterated Closest Point [reference] algorithm for rigid registration, 5) optionally, segmentation and visualization of 3D models of the tumor are obtained rapidly using editing capabilities of 3D Slicer, and 6) finally, virtual needles are selected on a schematic of the template and rendered in the 2D and 3D views, with the insertion depth independently\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["895"]}
{"title": "Prostate central gland segmentation using a spherical template driven graph approach\n", "abstract": " PurposeProstate cancer is the most abundant cancer in men, with over 240,000 expected new cases and around 28,000 deaths in 2012 in the US alone [1]. Accurate risk stratification for each individual cancer is central to a successful treatment strategy, especially because of the high incidence rate of less aggressive prostate cancers, and the high complication rate of radical prostatectomy. Diagnostic prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI guided prostate biopsies have demonstrated improved diagnostic discrimination rates of the different types of cancer [2]. Our goal is to enhance the state of the art in automated segmentation (ie delineation) of organ limits for the prostate, a step that has been shown to facilitate efficient MR-guided biopsy.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["895"]}
{"title": "Challenges and Opportunities of Intraoperative 3D Ultrasound With Neuronavigation in Relation to Intraoperative MRI\n", "abstract": " Introduction: Neuronavigation greatly improves the surgeon\u2019s ability to approach, assess and operate on brain tumors, but tends to lose its accuracy as the surgery progresses and substantial brain shift and deformation occurs. iMRI can partially address this problem but is resource intensive and workflow disruptive. iUS provides real-time information that can be used to update neuronavigation and provide real-time information regarding the resection progress. We describe the intraoperative use of 3DiUS in relation to iMRI, and discuss the challenges and opportunities in its use in neurosurgical practice. Methods: We performed a retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent image-guided brain tumor resection in which both 3DiUS and iMRI were used. The study was conducted between June and December 2020.For each patient, three or more 3DiUS images were acquired during the procedure, and one iMRI was acquired towards the end. The iUS images included an extradural ultrasound sweep acquired before dural incision,a post-dural opening iUS, and a third iUS acquired immediately before the iMRI acquisition. iUS and preoperative MRI were compared to evaluate the ability of iUS to visualize tumor boundaries and critical anatomic landmarks; iUS-3 and iMRI were compared to evaluate the ability of iUS for predicting residual tumor. Results: 23 patients were included in this study. Fifteen patients had tumors located in eloquent or near eloquent brain regions, the majority of patients had low grade gliomas (11), GTR was achieved in 12 patients, postoperative temporary deficits were observed in five patients.

{"title": "Vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer: MRI characteristics and correlation with patient outcome after salvage radiation therapy\n", "abstract": " Purpose To evaluate MRI characteristics in vaginal recurrence of endometrial cancer (EC) including tumor volume shrinkage during salvage radiotherapy, and to identify imaging features associated with survival.   Methods Patients with vaginal recurrence of EC treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) followed by brachytherapy (BT), and with available pelvic MRI at two time points: baseline and/or before BT were retrospectively identified from 2004 to 2017. MRI features including recurrence location and tissue characteristics on T2- and T1-weighted images were evaluated at baseline only. Tumor volumes were measured both at baseline and pre-BT. Survival rates and associations were evaluated by Cox regression and Fisher\u2019s exact test, respectively.

{"title": "Deep information theoretic registration\n", "abstract": " This paper establishes an information theoretic framework for deep metric based image registration techniques. We show an exact equivalence between maximum profile likelihood and minimization of joint entropy, an important early information theoretic registration method. We further derive deep classifier-based metrics that can be used with iterated maximum likelihood to achieve Deep Information Theoretic Registration on patches rather than pixels. This alleviates a major shortcoming of previous information theoretic registration approaches, namely the implicit pixel-wise independence assumptions. Our proposed approach does not require well-registered training data; this brings previous fully supervised deep metric registration approaches to the realm of weak supervision. We evaluate our approach on several image registration tasks and show significantly better performance compared to mutual information, specifically when images have substantially different contrasts. This work enables general-purpose registration in applications where current methods are not successful.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["895"]}

{"title": "Location of local recurrence after MRI-guided partial prostate brachytherapy targeting only the peripheral zone: implications for focal therapy\n", "abstract": " ResultsOnly 3 of 10 patients had local recurrences at the same location as the baseline tumor with a mean overlap of 64%. Seven of 10 patients had local recurrences at a different location with a mean overlap of 5%. Five of 10 patients had recurrences in the central zone of the prostate which did not definitively show tumor on review of the initial 1.5 T staging scan.ConclusionAfter MRI-guided brachytherapy targeting only the peripheral zone in men initially staged with 1.5 T MRI, 50% of the local recurrences occurred at the nontargeted central zone, raising the possibility that focal therapy directed only at the dominant tumor will result in increased out-of-field recurrences. Whether the superior ability of modern 3T multiparametric MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging to detect and precisely localize occult prostate cancer foci will reduce this risk could be the subject of further study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["895"]}
{"title": "SU\u2010D\u2010108\u201002: Applications of Electromagnetic Tracking Technology to High Dose Rate (HDR) Interstitial Brachytherapy\n", "abstract": " Purpose: HDR interstitial brachytherapy (IB) is a technique used for the treatment of gynecologic and prostate tumors that places multiple 6F catheters in the target region. Determining catheter location without transferring the patient to a scanner would enhance planning and treatment quality assurance (QA). We investigate the use of electromagnetic tracking technology (EM) for the localization of catheters used in IB. Methods: A phantom implanted with 12 plastic catheters inserted through a template with 5 registration points was fabricated and CT scanned to establish reference geometry. A non\u2010ionizing EM tracking system with a 1.3\u2010mm diameter sensor that could be inserted through the length of the interstitial catheters was used to measure the configuration of catheters. EM and CT coordinates were rigidly fused based on 5 template points and 1 catheter tip.

{"title": "Location of local recurrence after MRI-guided partial prostate brachytherapy targeting only the peripheral zone: Implications for focal therapy.\n", "abstract": " 149  Background: Prostate cancer local recurrences usually occur at the same site as the dominant primary tumor in patients treated with radiation therapy to the whole gland. We characterized location of local recurrences in patients who were treated with MRI Guided Partial Brachytherapy in which only the peripheral zone was targeted.  Methods: We retrospectively reviewed ten patients with initial cT1c, Gleason score 3+4 or less prostate cancer who developed biopsy proven local recurrences and had available imaging after MRI Guided Partial Brachytherapy targeting the peripheral zone from 1998 to 2006. All 10 patients had 1.5T endorectal coil MRI at diagnosis, performed primarily for staging and not for tumor localization, while at recurrence 8 had 3T endorectal coil MRI and 2 had 1.5T endorectal coil MRI. Scans consisted of at least T1 and T2 sequences. Two radiologists (C.T. and T.P.) blinded to clinical data\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["895"]}
{"title": "Interactive real-time segmentation for vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs in sagittal planes\n", "abstract": " PurposeInteractive segmentation approaches like [1, 2] get more and more popular, because automatic segmentation methods are typically only suitable for a specific type of pathology in a specific imaging modality and still fail time-by-time. Moreover, most automatic approaches need precise parameter settings to provide good results. The state of the art or rather clinical practice is in the most medical departments still manual slice-byslice segmentations which are very time consuming. In this contribution, we present the initial results of an interactive graphbased approach for vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs segmentation that provides real-time feedback to the user during the segmentation process. The speed and real-time behavior makes this approach even suitable for MR-guided biopsies of vertebral bodies where several planes are used in planning and executing the interventions [3].", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["895"]}
{"title": "Capability of the Medical Image Computing Platform 3D Slicer for Glioblastoma Multiforme Segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Data\n", "abstract": " PurposeGliomas are the most common primary brain tumors, evolving from the cerebral supportive cells. The World Health Organization (WHO) grading system for gliomas defines grades I-IV, where grade I tumors are the least aggressive and IV are the most aggressive [1]. 70% belong to the group of malignant gliomas (anaplastic astrocytoma grade III, glioblastoma multiforme grade IV). The glioblastoma multiforme, named for its histopathological appearance, is the most frequent malignant primary tumor and is one of the most highly malignant human neoplasms. Volumetric change in grade IV tumors (glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) over time is a critical factor in treatment decisions by physicians. Typically, the tumor volume is computed on a slice-by-slice basis using MRI patient scans obtained at regular intervals. In this contribution we investigated the capability of the medical image computing platform 3D Slicer for the segmentation of GBMs.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["895"]}
{"title": "Pituitary Adenoma Segmentation Using the Medical Image Computing Platform 3D Slicer\n", "abstract": " PurposeTumors of the sellar region, mainly pituitary adenomas, represent 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with adenomas comprising the largest portion with an estimated prevalence of approximately 17%[1, 2]. These adenomas can be classified according to many criteria including size, histological characteristics, and hormone secretion (hormone active and hormone-inactive). Microadenomas are less than 1 cm in diameter, whereas macroadenomas measure more than 1 cm. Typically for macroadenomas with mass-effect, transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice [3]. By contrast, hormoneinactive microadenomas are closely monitored using endocrine and ophthalmological evaluations as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Microsurgical excision is performed if the tumor volume increases over time. Image analysis that includes segmentation and registration of these successive scans is beneficial in the accurate measurement of tumor progression.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["895"]}
{"title": "Graph-Based Vertebra Segmentation Using a Cubic Template\n", "abstract": " PurposeThe current development of the population\u2019s structure leads to a growing part of older patients with a more frequent insistence for surgical treatment like lumbar spinal stenosis (LS), which is the most common cause of spinal surgery in individuals older than 65 years of age [1]. For the assessment of spinal structures such as nerve roots, intervertebral discs and ligamentary constitution, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is in general suitable. However, certain changes of the vertebra due to osteoporosis, fractures or osteophytes, require an evaluation of the bone structures via Computed Tomography (CT)-scans, which include radiation exposure [2]. In this contribution, we want to illustrate the capability of MRI-segmentation to reconstruct the vertebral body without x-ray examination, leading to less pre-operative examinations and therefore affecting radiation exposure costs and timemanagement.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["895"]}
