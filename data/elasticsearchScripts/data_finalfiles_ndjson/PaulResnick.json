GroupLens is a system for collaborative filtering of netnews, to help people find articles they will like in the huge stream of available articles.

Sellers are more likely to stop listing items right after receiving a negative feedback. Sellers who continue listing do not seem to improve their performance in order to salvage their reputations.

We then present the Sidelines algorithm\u2013which temporarily suppresses a voter\u2019s preferences after a preferred item has been selected\u2013as one approach to increase the diversity of result sets. In comparison to collections of the most popular items, from user votes on Digg. com and links from a panel of political blogs, the Sidelines algorithm increased inclusion while decreasing alienation. For the blog links, a set with known political preferences, we also found that Sidelines improved proportional representation. In an online experiment using blog link data as votes, readers were more likely to find something challenging to their views in the Sidelines result sets. These findings can help build news and opinion aggregators that present users with a broader range of topics and opinions.", "num_citations": "67\n", "authors": ["1169"]}

To address gaps in current understanding of how to design technology-supported physical activity interventions, we conducted a randomized field experiment of a commitment device: making public announcements. In a control condition, weekly commitments were kept private. In two treatment conditions, they were announced on Facebook and by email. In one of the two, the announcements also included results: whether the previous week's commitment was kept. We find that, with or without public results, these posts can elicit supportive replies from the poster's social networks. People in both public announcements conditions were less likely to make commitments.

To promote physical activity at the University of Michigan during the winter months, an eight-week Internet-mediated program (Active U) was developed providing participants with an online physical activity log, goal setting, motivational emails, and optional team participation and competition. This study is a program evaluation of Active U. Approximately 47,000 faculty, staff, and graduate students were invited to participate in the online Active U intervention in the winter of 2007. Participants were assigned a physical activity goal and were asked to record each physical activity episode into the activity log for eight weeks. Statistics for program reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation were calculated using the Re-Aim framework. Multilevel regression analyses were used to assess the decline in rates of data entry and goal attainment during the program, to assess the likelihood of joining a team by demographic characteristics, to test the association between various predictors and the number of weeks an individual met his or her goal, and to analyze server load. Overall, 7,483 individuals registered with the Active U website (\u224816% of eligible), and 79% participated in the program by logging valid data at least once. Staff members, older participants, and those with a BMI < 25 were more likely to meet their weekly physical activity goals, and average rate of meeting goals was higher among participants who joined a competitive team compared to those who participated individually (IRR = 1.28, P < .001).

Most important to members was that the groups felt safe and trustworthy. Drawing on these insights, we contribute a novel framing, community commerce, which explains the trust mechanisms that enable transactions between strangers in some groups.

Each party maintains a trust account for each other party. When a principal's trust balance for an agent is high enough to cover potential losses from a bad interaction, direct trust is sufficient to enable the interaction.

We analyzed political subreddits that had distinctive, stable levels of toxic comments on Reddit, in order to identify the relative contribution of these four processes. Surprisingly, we find that the largest source of norm stability is pre-entry learning. That is, newcomers' first comments in these distinctive subreddits differ from those same people's prior behavior in other subreddits. Through this adjustment, they nearly match the toxicity level of the subreddit they are joining. We also show that behavior adjustments are community-specific and not broadly transformative. That is, people continue to post toxic comments at their previous rates in other political subreddits.

These tasks also pose a serious challenge, thanks to the volume of text data, the dynamic nature of language, and the variance in applicable frames across issues (eg, the \u2018innocence\u2019frame of the death penalty debate is not used in discussing smoking bans).

This introduces opportunities to misbehave without paying reputational consequences. A large degree of cooperation can still emerge, through a convention in which newcomers ``pay their dues'' by accepting poor treatment from players who have established positive reputations. One might hope for an open society where newcomers are treated well, but there is an inherent social cost in making the spread of reputations optional. We prove that no equilibrium can sustain significantly more cooperation than the dues-paying equilibrium in a repeated random matching game with a large number of players in which players have finite lives and the ability to change their identities, and there is a small but nonvanishing probability of mistakes. Although one could remove the inefficiency of mistreating newcomers by disallowing anonymity, this is not practical or desirable in a wide variety of transactions. We discuss the use of entry fees, which permits newcomers to be trusted but excludes some players with low payoffs, thus introducing a different inefficiency.

{"title": "Multiple dimensions of generalization in model-based troubleshooting\n", "abstract": " Two observations motivate our work:(a) model-based diagnosis programs are powerful but do not learn from experience, and (b) one of the long-term trends in learning research has been the increasing use of knowledge to guide and inform the process of induction. We have developed a knowledge-guided learning method, based in EBL, that allows a model-based diagnosis program to selectively accumulate and generalize its experience. Our work is novel in part because it produces several different kinds of generalizations from a single example. Where previous work in learning has for the most part intensively explored one or another specific kind of generalization, our work has focused on accumulating and using multiple different grounds for generalization, ie, multiple domain theories. As a result our system not only learns from a single example (as in all EBL), it can learn multiple things from a single example. Simply saying there ought to be multiple grounds for generalization only opens up the possibility of exploring more than one domain theory. We provide some guidance in determining which grounds to explore by demonstrating that in the domain of physical devices, causal models are a rich source of useful domain theories. We also caution that adding more knowledge can sometimes degrade performance. Hence we need to select the grounds for generalization carefully and analyze the resulting rules to ensure that they improve performance. We illustrate one such quantitative analysis in the context of a model-based troubleshooting program, measuring and analyzing the gain resulting from the generalizations produced.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1169"]}

Contrary to a simple narrative of echo chambers, we find a surprising amount of cross-talk: most users with at least 10 comments posted at least once on both left-leaning and right-leaning YouTube channels. Cross-talk, however, was not symmetric. Based on the user leaning predicted by a hierarchical attention model, we find that conservatives were much more likely to comment on left-leaning videos than liberals on right-leaning videos. Secondly, YouTube's comment sorting algorithm made cross-partisan comments modestly less visible; for example, comments from conservatives made up 26.3% of all comments on left-leaning videos but just over 20% of the comments were in the top 20 positions. Lastly, using Perspective API's toxicity score as a measure of quality, we find that conservatives were not significantly more toxic than liberals when users directly commented on the content of videos. However, when users replied to comments from other users, we find that cross-partisan replies were more toxic than co-partisan replies on both left-leaning and right-leaning videos, with cross-partisan replies being especially toxic on the replier's home turf.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1169"]}

Examples include: which of two alternative paper titles is better? is this comment toxic? what is the political leaning of this news article? We refer to such tasks as survey settings because the ground truth is defined through a survey of one or more human raters. In survey settings, conventional measurements of classifier accuracy such as precision, recall, and cross-entropy confound the quality of the classifier with the level of agreement among human raters. Thus, they have no meaningful interpretation on their own. We describe a procedure that, given a dataset with predictions from a classifier and K ratings per item, rescales any accuracy measure into one that has an intuitive interpretation. The key insight is to score the classifier not against the best proxy for the ground truth, such as a majority vote of the raters, but against a single human rater at a time. That score can be compared to other predictors' scores, in particular predictors created by combining labels from several other human raters. The survey equivalence of any classifier is the minimum number of raters needed to produce the same expected score as that found for the classifier.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1169"]}

Choices on each of the design dimensions affect user interactions, the sound and feel, in predictable ways. The best style will depend on the experience levels of an application's users.* MIT Room E53-325", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1169"]}
{"title": "The rainbow pages\n", "abstract": " Telecommunication networks have the power to bring people together. Unfortunately, text-based bulletin boards require personal computers as front-ends and that restricts access to only those individuals and organizations that can afford to purchase computers. A voice bulletin board, on the other hand, uses any touch-tone telephone as a front end, and most people in this country already own or can afford to purchase a touchtone telephone. This paper describes the rationale for and design of a free, public-access voice bulletin board that attempts to bring the power of computing to the people of one neighborhood in Boston.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1169"]}
