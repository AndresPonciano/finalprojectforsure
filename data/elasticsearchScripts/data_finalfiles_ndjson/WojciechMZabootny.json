Despite the very hostile environment at the LHC, the performance obtained with these algorithms is found to be excellent. For t bar t events under typical 2011 pileup conditions, the average track-reconstruction efficiency for promptly-produced charged particles with transverse momenta of p T> 0.9GeV is 94% for pseudorapidities of| \u03b7|< 0.9 and 85% for 0.9<| \u03b7|< 2.5. The inefficiency is caused mainly by hadrons that undergo nuclear interactions in the tracker material. For isolated muons, the corresponding efficiencies are essentially 100%.

{"title": "The CMS trigger system\n", "abstract": " This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage.

The prime motivation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to elucidate the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking for which the Higgs mechanism is presumed to be responsible. The experimental study of the Higgs mechanism also can shed light on the mathematical consistency of the SM at energy scales above about 1 TeV. However, there are alternatives that invoke more symmetry such as supersymmetry or invoke new forces or constituents such as strongly-broken electroweak symmetry, technicolour, etc. An as yet unknown mechanism is also possible. Furthermore there are high hopes for discoveries that could pave the way towards a unified theory. These discoveries could take the form of supersymmetry or extra dimensions, the latter requiring modification of gravity at the TeV scale. Hence there are many compelling reasons to investigate the TeV energy scale. Hadron colliders are well suited to the task of exploring new energy domains, and the region of 1 TeV constituent centre-of-mass energy can be explored if the proton energy and the luminosity are high enough. The beam energy (7 TeV) and the design luminosity (L= 1034 cm\u2212 2 s\u2212 1) of the LHC have been chosen in order to study physics at the TeV energy scale.

The implemented sorter is able to sort one data record every two clock periods. This throughput does not depend on the capacity of the sorter (defined as number of storage cells in the sorter).

{"title": "Fast data acquisition measurement system for plasma diagnostics using GEM detectors\n", "abstract": " This paper refers to the measurement system for plasma diagnostics of tokamaks, that is currently being developed. In thermonuclear fusion research reactors, precise determination of the level and spatial distribution of the plasma soft X-ray radiation will be important for plasma parameters optimization. The system is based on the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detector with high speed communication interfaces and effective algorithms for data processing, implemented in the FPGA units and in real time software [1]. The current implementation of the system's hardware allows achieving high signal rates from the detector. The system can work in two modes: First mode performs fast raw data acquisition of the analog signals, giving therefore important information about the plasma or other radiation sources. On the contrary, the second mode performs an online calculation of the charges registered on the GEM channel. Further post processing is done by software running on embedded PC. Due to the modular structure of the measurement system, GEM detector readout boards can have different readout structures (1D, 2D, redundant, etc.). The system can work with connected both one-or two-dimensional readout boards. In order to provide high throughput of the data to the post-processing algorithms, advanced gigabit serial communication interfaces are used. The main goal of the work was to develop a new generation of SXR measurement system with a large number of measurements channel and high sampling speed. The first generation of the system included 256 readout channels, whereas the sampling frequency was 77 MHz, with 10 ms\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["878"]}

Because of an increased incidence of atypical language lateralisation in the right hemisphere of left-handed neurological patients, more systematic studies on handedness and cerebral asymmetry of language have been undertaken. The present study is aimed at clarification of the relationship between handedness and language dominance in healthy subjects. Lateralisation was measured directly using functional transcranial Doppler sonography in left-handed subjects. Twenty-six individuals participated in the study. Three kinds of tasks were used, differing in the material involved and in appropriate strategies to be employed by the subjects. Two important parameters of the MCA blood flow were analysed: mean relative increase in the blood flow velocity (MDV) and specific patterns of cognitive task performance (ie performance profiles). Our results indicate that the incidence of the right hemisphere dominance for language depends on the degree of handedness, since only in the group of consistent left-handers language was right lateralised. In other left-handers both cerebral hemispheres were functionally equivalent. The measurement of MCA blood flow velocity changes using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography seems to be a simple and non-invasive method of assessing the functioning of the two hemispheres of human brain.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["878"]}

A thorough investigation has shown that the cause was an incorrect behavior of the heap sorter in case of overflow. The significant advantage of the heap sorter is the perfect sorting of hits. However, its behavior at high rates is not acceptable. As a solution for that problem, a new concept of the hit sorter has been proposed. It utilizes the bin (bucket) sorting, where hits are stored to the appropriate buffer depending on their timestamp\u2019s lower bits. The hits in each bin are not sorted, but correct handling of overflow is much easier. If a hit is received for an already filled bucket, the hit is dropped and the bucket is marked as overflown.

{"title": "An FPGA-Based High-Speed Error Resilient Data Aggregation and Control for High Energy Physics Experiment\n", "abstract": " Due to the dramatic increase of data volume in modern high energy physics (HEP) experiments, a robust high-speed data acquisition (DAQ) system is very much needed to gather the data generated during different nuclear interactions. As the DAQ works under harsh radiation environment, there is a fair chance of data corruption due to various energetic particles like alpha, beta, or neutron. Hence, a major challenge in the development of DAQ in the HEP experiment is to establish an error resilient communication system between front-end sensors or detectors and back-end data processing computing nodes. Here, we have implemented the DAQ using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) due to some of its inherent advantages over the application-specific integrated circuit. A novel orthogonal concatenated code and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) have been used to mitigate the effects of data corruption in the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["878"]}
{"title": "Automatic latency equalization in VHDL-implemented complex pipelined systems\n", "abstract": " In the pipelined data processing systems it is very important to ensure that parallel paths delay data by the same number of clock cycles. If that condition is not met, the processing blocks receive data not properly aligned in time and produce incorrect results. Manual equalization of latencies is a tedious and error-prone work. This paper presents an automatic method of latency equalization in systems described in VHDL. The proposed method uses simulation to measure latencies and verify introduced correction. The solution is portable between different simulation and synthesis tools. The method does not increase the complexity of the synthesized design comparing to the solution based on manual latency adjustment. The example implementation of the proposed methodology together with a simple design demonstrating its use is available as an open source project under BSD license.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["878"]}

{"title": "Improvement of FPGA control via high speed but high latency interfaces\n", "abstract": " In last years, the throughput of interfaces used in computer systems to control extension boards or external hardware has increased significantly. Unfortunately, those interfaces have also significant round-trip latency. This fact seriously impairs the efficiency of those control algorithms, which require a tight handshake. In such algorithms, the communication consists of a sequence of write and read operations, where read result (the handshake status) must be checked before the next write command is issued. This problem can be solved by the implementation of an intelligent controller in the controlled hardware. This controller should execute high-level commands locally performing all necessary handshake operations.

Two group of subjects were tested. The first group consisted of 10 students with school difficulties, diagnosed neuropsychologically as having a particular form of dyslexia, ie dysgraphy or dysorthography. 6 of them were right lateralized and 4--left lateralized. The second contained 10 students without such problems. 7 of them were right lateralized and 3--left lateralized. We used four kinds of cognitive tasks, during which the blood flow velocity in MCA in left and right hemisphere was measured with the Transcranial Doppler method. The analysis of the results showed differences between the groups of blood flow velocity levels, without a difference in performance profile. The dysgraphic persons had significantly higher blood flow velocity in the right hemisphere compared to the reference group. The results suggest particularly important role of right hemisphere in dyslexic persons, which is consistent with results obtained by other authors. The analysis of lateralization showed that this factor influences significantly the blood flow velocity level--the left lateralized persons showed lower rise of blood flow velocity than the right lateralized, regardless of the kind of task and measured hemisphere.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["878"]}

Proposed design targets cost-efficient multichannel data acquisition systems, in which multiple FPGA based front end boards (FEB) should transmit the stream of acquired data to the computer network, responsible for their final processing and archiving. The presented solution allows to minimize the cost of data concentration due to use of inexpensive Ethernet network infrastructure. The work is mainly focused on minimization of resources consumption in the FPGA, and minimization of acknowledge latency in the Linux based system - which allows to achieve high throughput in spite of use of inexpensive FPGA chips with small internal memory.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["878"]}

{"title": "Low cost open data acquisition system for biomedical applications\n", "abstract": " In the biomedical applications it is often necessary to collect measurement data from different devices. It is relatively easy, if the devices are equipped with a MIB or Ethernet interface, however often they feature only the asynchronous serial link, and sometimes the measured values are available only as the analog signals.  The system presented in the paper is a low cost alternative to commercially available data acquisition systems. The hardware and software architecture of the system is fully open, so it is possible to customize it for particular needs. The presented system offers various possibilities to connect it to the computer based data processing unit - e.g. using the USB or Ethernet ports. Both interfaces allow also to use many such systems in parallel to increase amount of serial and analog inputs. The open source software used in the system makes possible to process the acquired data with standard tools like\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["878"]}

{"title": "Dynamics of Hydrocephalus Development After Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage\n", "abstract": " In the early stage of the cerebrospinal compensatory disturbances seen after SAH, the ventricular system is not necessarily dilated [5]. ICP, however, is commonly increased immediately after SAH, but often recovers to a low or moderate level during vasospasm. A decrease in the blood flow velocity, which is considered to be a sign of recovery to the normal autoregulatory ability after vasospasm, is usually observed after the 3rd or 4th week [4, 5]. The further development of the high-(HPH) or normal-(NPH) pressure hydrocephalus has still an unknown nature.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["878"]}
