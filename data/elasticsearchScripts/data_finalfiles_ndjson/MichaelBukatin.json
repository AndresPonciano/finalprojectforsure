{"title": "Partial metric spaces\n", "abstract": " As with many mathematical concepts these axioms are chosen to ensure that two things are equal if and only if some property expressible in terms of the concept holds. For a metric space, x= y if and only if d (x, y)= 0. Thus as there is the equality relation x= y in a metric space, so there is what we call an indistancy relation d (x, y)= 0. Axioms M1 and M2 work together to identify equality with indistancy. That is x and y are equal if and only if x and y have no distance between them. Such identification may seem to be so fundamental that to suggest otherwise would serve no purpose. However, there is a longstanding precedent for relaxing the axioms which ensure this identification. The relation defined by x\u2261 y if and only if d (x, y)= 0 is an equivalence, which can be useful, as in the construction of the classical lp-spaces. In this construction, spaces are considered in which axiom M2 is dropped while the others hold\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "203\n", "authors": ["1734"]}

It turns out that multivalued equalities and partial metrics are closely related: one can either consider them equivalent up to the choice of dual notation, or one can formally capture the duality between logical and metric viewpoints by explicitly requiring logical values and distances to be represented by dual structures. Not only does this allow the transfer of the ideas and results between these two fields, but the most interesting situations are those of interplay between logical and metric considerations. The computational understanding of partial metrics as upper bounds and of multivalued equalities as lower bounds is discussed, together with the lower bound counterparts to partial metrics and the corresponding upper bound counterparts\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1734"]}

Ideally theoretical advances should lead at once to the new applications, however, given the state of the art it does not seem feasible. Therefore we opt for the research program consisting of two parts. Part 1 consists of advancing the mathematics of topological models of computation. It does take potential applications into account, but we do not expect to incorporate any such applications in this Thesis. The internal mathematical motivations will mostly guide the theoretical part. Part 2 consists of applying the existing body of knowledge to software engineering, and, in particular, to the design and implementation of programming languages. We have found that paradigms employed in the design of most modern\" academic\" programming languages seem to be incompatible with mathematical models of computations we prefer. Therefore, we will perform experimental explorations in the design and implementation of programming languages.

Complexity theory in Computer Science has dramatically advanced through an intelligent understanding of algorithms over discrete totally defined data structures such as directed graphs, without using partially defined information. So we have an unfortunate longstanding separation of partial metric spaces for modelling partially defined computable information from the complexity theory of algorithms for costing totally defined computable information.

{"title": "Information Systems and Retractions: an Elementary Treatment\n", "abstract": " We show that information systems allow to treat retractions of domains for denotational semantics in more simple and intuitive ways. We consider both algebraic and continuous cases. The basic intuition is that an approximable mapping r describing a retraction jrj should be treated as a candidate to become the entailment relationin the information system to describe Fix (jrj) as a domain.In the algebraic case this means that closure operations are the best since only they possess the re exivity property: 8u 2 Con: uru. For all other retractions we have to exclude assertions that become non-re exive, which means that we are generally unable to describe their sets of xed points by information systems. Yet the situation can be somewhat salvaged if r performes all its entailments via re exive elements. Formally, we can write it as 8u; w 2 Con: urw) 9v 2 Con: urv; vrv; vrw. v here is an element retaining re exivity. This formula is the necessary and su cient condition for the retraction jrj to be nitary, because we can use elements retaining re exivity as a backbone to build an information system that would describe a domain isomorphic to Fix (jrj) as an algebraic cpo. Since we still have to exclude non-re exive elements, this isomorphism cannot be re ned to equality. This criterion of nitarity can be rewritten as 8u; w 2Con: urw)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1734"]}
{"title": "Subdomains for Algebraic Information Systems\n", "abstract": " In 1976 Dana Scott suggested using retractions to describe subdomains, the use of closure operations being suggested in the algebraic case Scott 76]. Both choices were only marginally understood at that time. The present paper shows that the use of information systems (see Scott 82]) naturally leads to closure operations in the algebraic case. Speci cally, subdomains are formed due to the fact that some elements lose consistency or deductive closure and thus, are excluded from an original domain, jAj. The inconsistency in jAj is treated as the entailment of the contradiction in jA> j= jAj f> g. Thus, the subdomains of jAj correspond to the intensi cations of the entailment relation in jA> j. These intensi cations are approximable mappings and the corresponding continuous functions are precisely the closure operations on jA> j (x:> is excluded). A closure operation jrj: jA> j! jA> j yields the subdomain jRj jAj, jRj= Fix (jrj) n f> g.The domain of all subdomains, jSub (A) j, is constructed for every domain jAj. jSub (A) j is a subdomain of jA>! A> j, and its elements are approximable mappings representing subdomains of jAj. The fundamental property of jSub (A) j is that r vSub (A) si jRj jSj for the subdomains jRj and jSj corresponding to r and s. The following related matters are also discussed: the idea of data types as objects, the projection of jSub (A) j onto jAj and the equations such as jXj= jSub (X) j, the nitary projections and why their xed points do not form subdomains, and the somewhat adverse relationship between retraction-based subtypes and intensional type theories.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1734"]}
