{"title": "An advanced glycation endproduct cross-link breaker can reverse age-related increases in myocardial stiffness\n", "abstract": " Decreased elasticity of the cardiovascular system is one of the  hallmarks of the normal aging process of mammals. A potential  explanation for this decreased elasticity is that glucose can react  nonenzymatically with long-lived proteins, such as collagen and lens  crystallin, and link them together, producing advanced glycation  endproducts (AGEs). Previous studies have shown that aminoguanidine, an  AGE inhibitor, can prevent glucose cross-linking of proteins and the  loss of elasticity associated with aging and diabetes. Recently, an AGE  cross-link breaker (ALT-711) has been described, which we have  evaluated in aged dogs.

{"title": "Recent updates in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders using natural compounds\n", "abstract": " Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by protein aggregates and inflammation as well as oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS). Multiple biological processes are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as depletion or insufficient synthesis of neurotransmitters, oxidative stress, abnormal ubiquitination. Furthermore, damaging of blood brain barrier (BBB) in the CNS also leads to various CNS-related diseases. Even though synthetic drugs are used for the management of Alzheimer\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s disease, Parkinson\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s disease, autism, and many other chronic illnesses, they are not without side effects. The attentions of researchers have been inclined towards the phytochemicals, many of which have minimal side effects. Phytochemicals are promising therapeutic agents because many phytochemicals have anti-inflammatory, antioxidative as well as anticholinesterase activities. Various drugs of either synthetic or natural origin applied in the treatment of brain disorders need to cross the BBB before they can be used.

{"title": "Carbamazepine as a possible anthropogenic marker in water: occurrences, toxicological effects, regulations and removal by wastewater treatment technologies\n", "abstract": " Carbamazepine (CBZ), a pharmaceutical compound, has been proposed as an anthropogenic marker to assess water quality due to its persistence in conventional treatment plants and widespread presence in water bodies. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on sources and occurrences of CBZ in water bodies, as well as toxicological effects and regulations of the drug. Given the documented side effects of CBZ on the human body when taken medicinally, its careful monitoring in water is recommended. CBZ residues in drinking water may provide a pathway to embryos and infants via intrauterine exposure or breast-feeding, which may cause congenital malformations and/or neurodevelopmental problems over long term exposure. An in-depth technical assessment of the conventional and advanced treatment technologies revealed the inadequacy of the standalone technologies. Compared to conventional activated sludge and membrane bioreactor processes, effective removal of CBZ can be achieved by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes. However, recent studies have revealed that harsh chemical cleaning, as required to mitigate membrane fouling, can often reduce the long-term removal efficiency. Furthermore, despite the efficient performance of activated carbon adsorption and advanced oxidation processes, a few challenges such as cost of chemicals and regeneration of activated carbon need to be carefully considered. The limitations of the individual technologies point to the advantages of combined and hybrid systems, namely, membrane bioreactor coupled with nanofiltration, adsorption or advanced\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "89\n", "authors": ["27"]}

But, it still remains a challenge in the field of pharmaceuticals for delivery of ionic species and some non ionic. Several transdermal approaches have been used and recently there has been a great attention in using iontophoretic technique for the transdermal drug delivery of medications, both ionic and non ionic. This technique of facilitated movement of ions across a membrane under the influence of an externally applied electric potential difference is one of the most promising physical skin penetrations enhancing method. The payback of using iontophoretic technique includes improved systemic bioavailability ensuing from bypassing the first metabolism.

This paper examines the energy and economic viability of the green roof technology in the hot humid climate of Saudi Arabia by considering a modern four bedroom residential building in the city of Dhahran as a case study. The base case and green roof modelling of the selected building has been developed with the help of DesignBuilder software. The base case model has been validated with the help of 3-month measured data about the energy consumption without a green roof installed. The result shows that the energy consumption for the base case is 169 kWh/m 2 while the energy consumption due to the application of a green roof on the entire roof surface is 110 kWh/m 2. For the three investigated green roof options, energy saving is found to be in the range of 24% to 35%. The economic evaluation based on the net present value (NPV) approach for 40 years with consideration to other environmental advantages indicates that the benefits of the green roof technology are realized towards the end of the life cycle of the building.

This study was carried out on real municipal wastewater to evaluate the influence of different operational strategies on membrane fouling at equivalent water yield. Four relaxation modes (MBR10+0, MBR10+1, MBR10+1.5 and MBR10+2) were tested to analyze membrane fouling behavior. For the optimization of relaxation modes, fouling rate in terms of trans-membrane pressure, hydraulic resistances and characteristics of fouling fractions were analyzed. It has been observed that cake layer resistance was minimum in MBR10+1.5 but pore blockage resistance was increased in all relaxation modes. Moreover, high instantaneous flux contributed significantly to fouling rate at the initial stage of MBR operations. Relaxation modes were also efficient in removing irreversible fouling to some extent\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Twenty bread wheat genotypes differing in yield performances were evaluated using a RCBD design with three replications under two different environments (irrigated and rein-fed) during 2004-2005 growing season. Grain yield of the genotype in the both conditions, Stress Tolerance Index (STI), was calculated for each genotype. Moreover Proline amino acid concentration (PC) in flag leaf of each genotype was also measured in grain filling stage in the stressed condition. Cell Membrane Stability (CMS) of leaf tissues in seedling stage was calculated for each genotype grown in the pots in greenhouse. Germination Stress Index (GSI), coleoptile length and root length, number of roots, Promptness Index in Stress (PIS) and non-stress (PINS) condition were recorded in the controlled condition of laboratory by using a 2x20 factorial experiment within completely randomized design with three replications under two different stress and non-stress (normal) water regimes. The result of analysis of variance exhibited highly significant difference among the genotypes for the most of the traits. Drought stress induced by PEG (polyethylene glycol) decreased all of the traits. Root length was the most sensitive to drought stress. Correlation analysis indicated strong association between STI and CMS and PC.

Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Herein, a versatile approach is demonstrated to skilfully synthesize Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen doped hollow carbon rods (Co2P/N-HCRs) by ball-milling following simple heat treatment. In particular, the Co/C content has an extremely important influence on the formation of Co2P/N-HCRs with tubular structures. Benefiting from structural advantages and synergistic effects between Co2P and the protective N-doped graphitic carbon shell, the optimal Co2P/N-HCRs display comparable electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability relative to a commercial Pt/C catalyst. Apart from providing a promising electrocatalyst alternative, this work, most importantly, holds great potential for a high-yielding yet cost-effective manufacturing\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Therefore, to maximize land use and production, the ultimate goal of agriculture, namely yield, intercropping is an advanced agronomic technique that allows two or more crops to yield from the same area of land. Better utilization of resources and reduced weed competition minimize the risk of food shortages by enhancing yield stability. Several factors can affect intercropping: plant density, sowing time, the maturity of a crop, the selection of crop that is compatible with another as well as farmers\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 and the region\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s socioeconomic conditions.

We sampled 81 locations spread over 160,000 km2 in Peninsular India including type localities, which represented two known and five previously undescribed species. Based on general similarity in body shape and dewlap all species were hitherto identified as members of the genus Sitana. However, Sitana deccanensis and two other morphotypes, which are endemic to north Karnataka and Maharashtra in Peninsular India, are very distinct from the rest of the known members of the genus Sitana based on their external morphology and osteology. Moreover, members of this distinct morphological group were monophyletic in the molecular tree, and this clade (clade 1) was sister to two well-supported clades (2 and 3) constituting the rest of the Sitana. The interclade genetic divergence in mtDNA between clade 1 and clades 2 and 3 was 21-23%, whereas clade 2 and clade 3 exhibited 14- 16% genetic divergence. Thus, we designate a new genus name \u0393\u00c7\u00a3Sarada\u0393\u00c7\u00a5 gen. nov. for species represented in Clade 1, which also includes the recently resurrected Sitana deccanensis.

Its role in breast tumor progression and metastasis to distant organs is well documented. Recent reports implicate OSM in macrophage M2 polarization, a key pro-tumoral phenomenon. M2 polarization of macrophages is believed to promote tumor progression by potentiating metastasis and angiogenesis. In the current study, we delineated the mechanism underlying OSM induced macrophage M2 polarization. The findings revealed that OSM skews macrophages towards an M2 polarized phenotype via mTOR signaling complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC2 relays signals through two effector kinases i.e. PKC-\u256c\u2592 and Akt.

{"title": "Angiogenesis: managing the culprits behind tumorigenesis and metastasis\n", "abstract": " Deregulated angiogenesis has been identified as a key contributor in a number of pathological conditions including cancer. It is a complex process, which involves highly regulated interaction of multiple signalling molecules. The pro-angiogenic signalling molecule, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its cognate receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), which is often highly expressed in majority of human cancers, plays a central role in tumour angiogenesis. Owing to the importance of tumour vasculature in carcinogenesis, tumour blood vessels have emerged as an excellent therapeutic target. The anti-angiogenic therapies have been shown to arrest growth of solid tumours through multiple mechanisms, halting the expansion of tumour vasculature and transient normalization of tumour vasculature which help in the improvement of blood flow resulting in more uniform delivery of cytotoxic agents to the core of tumour mass. This also helps in reduction of hypoxia and interstitial pressure leading to reduced chemotherapy resistance and more uniform delivery of cytotoxic agents at the targeted site. Thus, complimentary combination of different agents that target multiple molecules in the angiogenic cascade may optimize inhibition of angiogenesis and improve clinical benefit in the cancer patients. This review provides an update on the current trend in exploitation of angiogenesis pathways as a strategy in the treatment of cancer. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["27"]}

High frequency power transformer (HFPT) is one of its key components operating at several to tens of kHz. Under such high frequency voltage, accelerated insulation aging and premature insulation failure occur frequently. Partial discharge (PD) is considered as the main cause of electrical performance deterioration in HV systems or LV ones where overvoltage or surge may occur. Therefore, it is necessary to study the PD behavior and insulation life under different voltage frequencies, in order to have a better understanding of premature failure mechanism.

The impact of vascular disease on dementia is likely to increase further because of the poor diagnosis and management of vascular risk factors, the increase in life expectancy, and the improved survival following major cardiovascular events, e.g. acute stroke. It is estimated that the adequate management of vascular risk factors, with pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological interventions, might result in a 50% reduction in the forecasted dementia prevalence. The exact mechanisms by which vascular risk factors and vascular disease adversely affect brain function remain unclear, but it is hypothesized that endothelial dysfunction plays an important role.

The role of the housing sector in the country is critical as it accounts for half of the total national electricity consumption. It is important to apply sustainable energy concepts in this sector, and the application of Zero-Energy Homes (ZEHs) could be an appropriate option in this regard. In ZEHs, the energy demand needs to be reduced significantly before employing renewable energy, and a way to achieve that is through applying vernacular construction techniques and materials. This study aims to investigate the role of courtyard, mushrabiyah and adobe construction for the development of ZEHs in the five main Saudi climatic zones represented by Dhahran, Guriat, Riyadh, Jeddah and Khamis Mushait. A base house is designed, modelled and compared with measured electricity values. The comparison between the base house and the houses adapted with these techniques and materials is undertaken based on the annual electricity demand and the maximum power demand, and findings reveal that mushrabiyah can reduce them by 4% and 3%, respectively, while adobe can reduce them by 6% and 19%, respectively.

This paper provides a critical analysis of different models of service excellence. The purpose is to determine their strengths, limitations, and adequacy to provide a structured approach to service excellence implementation. The findings show that while individual models have their strengths and limitations, none provides a comprehensive approach to systematic implementation and management. The limitations of each model warrant the use of an integrated approach to develop an overarching system for service excellence.

{"title": "Altered paracellular cation permeability due to a rare CLDN10B variant causes anhidrosis and kidney damage\n", "abstract": " Claudins constitute the major component of tight junctions and regulate paracellular permeability of epithelia. Claudin-10 occurs in two major isoforms that form paracellular channels with ion selectivity. We report on two families segregating an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized anhidrosis, severe heat intolerance and mild kidney failure. All affected individuals carry a rare homozygous missense mutation c.144C>G, p.(N48K) specific for the claudin-10b isoform. Immunostaining of sweat glands from patients suggested that the disease is associated with reduced levels of claudin-10b in the plasma membranes and in canaliculi of the secretory portion. Expression of claudin-10b N48K in a 3D cell model of sweat secretion indicated perturbed paracellular Na+ transport. Analysis of paracellular permeability revealed that claudin-10b N48K maintained cation over anion selectivity but with a reduced general ion conductance. Furthermore, freeze fracture electron microscopy showed that claudin-10b N48K was associated with impaired tight junction strand formation and altered cis-oligomer formation. These data suggest that claudin-10b N48K causes anhidrosis and our findings are consistent with a combined effect from perturbed TJ function and increased degradation of claudin-10b N48K in the sweat glands. Furthermore, affected individuals present with Mg2+ retention, secondary hyperparathyroidism and mild kidney failure that suggest a disturbed reabsorption of cations in the kidneys.

The most serious problem of a carbon dioxide capture process that uses aqueous ammonia is a phenomenon involving ammonia vaporization known as ammonia slip. The chilled ammonia process (CAP) is an improved ammonia-based CO2 capture technology. Recent attention has been given to the process patented by Gal (2008), which involves a system operated at a low temperature to minimize the ammonia loss due to evaporation. This study focuses on the laboratory-scale experiment for analysis of the chilled ammonia process. The CO2 absorption ratio and amount of ammonia slip are measured at various operating conditions.

To design intracellular biosensors for metal ions and glucose, we grew ZnO nanorods on the tip of borosilicate glass capillaries (0.7 \u252c\u2561m in diameter) and characterized the nano-scale structure with field-emission scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The ZnO nanorods were functionalized accordingly for intracellular free metal ions or glucose measurements. Selectivity was achieved by using a metal-ion selective plastic membrane or glucose oxidase enzyme for glucose measurements. These functionalized ZnO nanorods showed high sensitivity and good biocompatibility for intracellular environments. Human adipocytes and frog oocytes were used for determinations of intracellular free metal ions and glucose concentrations. In this review, we discuss the simple and direct approach for intracellular measurements using ZnO nanostructure-based potentiometric biosensors for clinical and nonclinical applications. The performance of ZnO nanostructure-based intracellular sensor can be improved through engineering of morphology, effective surface area, functionality, and adsorption/desorption capability.

Plant growth regulators consist of a large group of naturally occurring or synthetically produced organic chemicals and considered as helping tool in the modern production system of ornamentals. Their exogenous application helps to improve the different economically important and market desirable characteristics of ornamental plants. The use of plant growth regulators is being practiced by the commercial growers of ornamental plants as a part of cultural practice. There are various factors contributing to the efficacy of plant growth regulators and the method of application plays key role in determining the effectiveness of plant growth regulators, as PGRs can be effective if properly absorbed by plants. There are various methods of application of PGRs but the most popular are foliar sprays, drenching and pre-plant soaking while the efficacy of each method depends on the various factors including the mode of absorption of PGRs by different plant parts, method of application and environmental factors.

The highest relapse-free survival was documented with ETV6-RUNX1 (14.2 months) followed closely by those cases in which no gene was detected (13.100). RFS with BCR-ABL, MLL-AF4, TCF3-PBX1 and SIL-TAL1 was less than 10 months (8.0, 3.6, 5.5 and 8.1 months, respectively).  CONCLUSIONS:   This is the first study from Pakistan correlating molecular markers with disease biology and treatment outcome in pediatric ALL. It revealed the highest reported frequency of BCR-ABL FO in pediatric ALL, associated with poor overall survival. Our data indicate an immediate need for incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the treatment of BCR-ABL+ pediatric ALL in this population and the development of facilities for stem cell transplantation.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["27"]}

We observed significant diuretic, kaliuretic and natriuretic effects in the treated groups in a dose dependent manner. However, urinary pH remained unchanged during the course of the study. The diuretic index values showed good diuretic activity of the crude extract. The Lipschitz values demonstrated that the crude extract, at the dose of 50 mg/kg, showed 46% diuretic activity compared with furosemide. With regard to the acute toxicity study, no lethal effects were observed among Albino mice even at the higher dose of 5000 mg/kg. The extract of Nigella sativa, at the dose of 50 mg/kg, significantly increased the urinary volume and modified the concentration of urinary electrolytes, and there was observed no signs of acute toxicity associated with the crude extract.

{"title": "Molecular genetics of glucosinolate biosynthesis in Brassicas: genetic manipulation and application aspect\n", "abstract": " Glucosinolates are sulphur containing secondary metabolites biosynthesized by many plant species in the order Brassicales. Physical tissue or cell injury leads to the breakdown of glucosinolates through the hydrolytic action of the enzyme myrosinase, resulting in the production of compounds including isothiocynates, thiocyanates and nitriles. Derivative compounds of glucosinolates have a wide range of biological functions including anticarcinogenic properties in humans, anti-nutritional effects of seed meal in animals, insect pest repellent and fungal disease suppression (Mithen et al., 2000; Brader et al., 2006). Glucosinolates play important role in the nutritional qualities of Brassica products. Brassica products are consumed as oil, meal and as vegetables. Rapeseed (B. napus, B. juncea and B. rapa) is a source of oil and has a protein-rich seed meal. High glucosinolates in the seed meal pose health risks to livestock (Fenwick et al., 1983; Griffiths et al., 1998). Consequently, plant breeders have nearly eliminated erucic acid from the seed oil and have dramatically reduced the level of seed glucosinolates (> 100 \u252c\u2561mole/g seed to< 30 \u252c\u2561mole/g seed) via conventional breeding, allowing the nutritious seed meal to be used as an animal feed supplement. There is, however, a significant residual content of glucosinolates in rapeseed/canola seed meal (over 10 \u252c\u2561mole/g seed) and further reduction of the total glucosinolate content would be nutritionally beneficial (McVetty et al., 2009). Therefore, to produce healthy seed meal from rapeseed, it is important to genetically manipulate glucosinolate content.

TrOCs were effectively retained (90\u0393\u00c7\u00f499%) by the MD membrane. Furthermore, significant laccase-catalyzed degradation (80\u0393\u00c7\u00f499%) was achieved for 10 phenolic and 3 non-phenolic TrOCs that contain strong electron donating functional groups. For the remaining TrOCs, enzymatic degradation ranged from 40 to 65%. This is still higher than those reported for enzymatic bioreactors equipped with ultrafiltration membranes, which retained laccase but not the TrOCs. Addition of three redox-mediators, namely syringaldehyde (SA), violuric acid (VA) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT), in the MD-EMBR significantly broadened the spectrum of efficiently degraded TrOCs. Among the tested redox-mediators, VA (0.5 mM) was the most efficient and versatile mediator for enhanced TrOC degradation. The final effluent (ie, membrane permeate) toxicity was below the detection limit, although there was a mediator-specific increase in toxicity of the bioreactor media.

Using survey data from three communities of varying socioeconomic conditions in Pakistan, this paper examines the links between the multiple dimensions of the Bottoms-Tankebe model of police legitimacy and support for vigilante violence. The findings show overall high levels of support for vigilantism. Regression analysis shows that experiences of police illegality consistently predict support for vigilantism across the three communities. Perceived quality of police decision-making predicts support for vigilantism in some conditions but not others. Contrary to expectations, quality of interpersonal treatment by police and police effectiveness do not explain support for vigilantism.

Silicon is known to better the deleterious effects of drought on plant growth and development. Silicon (Si) found to be an agronomically important fertilizer element that enhances plant tolerance to abiotic stresses (Liang et al., 2005). Silicon also known to increase drought tolerance in plants by maintaining plant water balance, photosynthetic efficiency, erectness of leaves and structure of xylem vessels under high transpiration rates due to higher temperature and moisture stress (Hattori et al., 2005). Similarly, Gong et al.,(2003 and 2005) observed improved water economy and dry matter yield of water under application of silicon. A number of possible mechanisms were proposed through which Si may increase salinity tolerance in plants, especially improving water status of plants, increased photosynthetic activity and ultra-structure of leaf organelles. The stimulation of antioxidant system and alleviation of specific ion effect by reducing Na uptake were also drought tolerance mechanisms in plants exposed to silicon application (Liang et al., 2005).", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The aim of this project was to develop one daily SR floating matrix tablet for theophylline using psyllium husk as release controlling polymer and to compare the release pattern with synthetic polymer ie HPMC K100 M. Other polymers like HPMC K15 M, sodium bicarbonate, Ac-Di-Sol etc. were also used. Formulations were prepared by wet granulation method and evaluated for buoyancy lag time, duration of buoyancy, dimensional stability, drug content, and in vitro release profile. It was found that Floating duration of the formulation containing psyllium husk alone was less than that containing similar concentration of HPMC K100M. The floating duration was made comparable with the formulation containing similar amount of HPMC K100M by addition of HPMC K15M. Release rate of the formulation containing psyllium husk in combination with HPMC K15M more than the formulation containing similar amount of HPMC K100M. It was found that dimensional stability increased with psyllium husk concentration while floating lag time decreased. The in vitro release data and drug release mechanism of the optimized formulation followed the Higuchi kinetics and nonfickain type respectively.

{"title": "ZnO nanostructure-based intracellular sensor\n", "abstract": " Recently ZnO has attracted much interest because of its usefulness for intracellular measurements of biochemical species by using its semiconducting, electrochemical, catalytic properties and for being biosafe and biocompatible. ZnO thus has a wide range of applications in optoelectronics, intracellular nanosensors, transducers, energy conversion and medical sciences. This review relates specifically to intracellular electrochemical (glucose and free metal ion) biosensors based on functionalized zinc oxide nanowires/nanorods. For intracellular measurements, the ZnO nanowires/nanorods were grown on the tip of a borosilicate glass capillary (0.7 \u252c\u2561m in diameter) and functionalized with membranes or enzymes to produce intracellular selective metal ion or glucose sensors. Successful intracellular measurements were carried out using ZnO nanowires/nanorods grown on small tips for glucose and free metal ions using two types of cells, human fat cells and frog oocytes. The sensors in this study were used to detect real-time changes of metal ions and glucose across human fat cells and frog cells using changes in the electrochemical potential at the interface of the intracellular micro-environment. Such devices are helpful in explaining various intracellular processes involving ions and glucose. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["27"]}

There are two main areas where underwater target tracking are presently employed for offshore and mining industry. First, sea floor survey and inspection and second is subsea installation, inspection and maintenance. This paper takes second area into account and AUV vision system is developed that can detect and track underwater installation such as oil or gas pipeline, and power or telecommunication cables for inspection and maintenance application. The usage of underwater installations has increased many folds. It is desirable to do routine inspection and maintenance to protect them from marine traffic, such as fishery and anchoring (Asakawa, et al., 2000). Detection and tracking of underwater pipeline in complex marine environment is fairly difficult task to achieve, due to the frequent presence of noise in a subsea surface. Noise is commonly introduced in underwater images by sporadic marine growth and dynamic lighting condition.Traditionally, vigilances, inspections and maintenances of underwater man made structures are carried out by using the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) controlled from the mother ship by a trained operator (Whitcomb, 2000).

{"title": "Water efficiency and management in sustainable building rating systems: Examining variation in criteria usage\n", "abstract": " The building sector, due to the significant energy and environmental footprints it creates, needs to adopt sustainable approaches to help prevent global warming and climate change. Sustainable Building (SB) rating systems have been developed around the world as a method to promote sustainability in this sector. Water is one of the most vital natural resources, and is extensively consumed in the building sector. This article examines the coverage of water-related aspects in 11 prominent SB rating systems under the three key sustainability dimensions: environmental, economic, and social, using a comprehensive coverage analysis approach. Findings highlight a wide range of variation between the examined SB rating systems in terms of water attributes being assessed, water assessment criteria used, the optimal number of these criteria, and the weight assigned to them. Results also show that in general, most of the examined systems exhibit low representativeness and comprehensive coverage of major water subcategories and themes related to sustainable buildings. However, some moderate to high comprehensive coverage was found in water attributes that focus on the environmental and social aspects. The results indicate that representative and comprehensive coverage of social-related water attributes are less than that of environment-related water attributes. The results also highlighted the effectiveness of using coverage analysis techniques as a systematic and efficient way to assess comprehensive coverage of water criteria in SB rating systems.

Life-cycle costing of windows has been carried out over a 40-year life span taking into account all the major cost factors involved. Running cost, the dominant element in life-cycle cost of windows, has been calculated for four possible maintenance options. Results have indicated that an \u0393\u00c7\u00ffair-filled triple-glazed aluminium-clad timber window\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 is the value engineered choice amongst the range of\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["27"]}
{"title": "Life cycle assessment of aluminium-clad timber windows\n", "abstract": " Over the last century a temperature rise of 0.6 C m global climate and the affiliated greenhouse effects have inflicted enormous impacts in the form of natural catastrophes, economical losses, health problems and seasonal disorder. If human activities continue at existing pace, a further temperature rise of 2.5 C is being anticipated over the next hundred years, which may cause unimaginable damage to humanity and ecology of the planet. In such a prevailing global environmental scenario sustainability is the need of hour and should be given the prime importance in execution of activities in all sectors in order to keep future secure for coming generations. Windows are amongst the most sensitive elements in a building envelope, also, due to their multi-disciplinary role, they are important not only for their effects on interior environment but also for the energy performance of the building. Energy contents and environmental impacts of the materials involved, add up on to window significance in the ecology of buildings. Energy efficient windows with least possible environmental burden over their whole life cycle are thus very important in achieving desired levels of sustainability in general, particularly in buildings. The present work addresses the sustainability of double glazed aluminium clad timber windows adopting the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. LCA of windows helps cutting down the associated ecological burdens at all stages, i.e. extraction/production of materials, operation, maintenance and disposal of windows at the end of their service life.

Bt cotton expressing a Cry1Ac gene is grown over a large area in Pakistan, however, there is a major concern that bollworms may develop resistance. Here we have used a durable resistance strategy against bollworms by developing a double gene construct containing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab (pGA482-12R) for cotton transformation. Both Cry toxin genes have been cloned in the same T-DNA borders and transferred successfully into cotton via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Both genes are expressed in transgenic cotton plants and is likely to help breeders in developing new cotton cultivars by incorporating these genes in cotton lines having no Bt genes or expressing Cry1Ac gene (Mon 531).

{"title": "Managing and breeding wheat for organic systems: enhancing competitiveness against weeds\n", "abstract": " Genetically uniform cultivars in many self-pollinated cereal crops dominate commercial production in high-input environments especially due to their high grain yields and wide geographical adaptation. These cultivars generally perform well under favorable and high-input farming systems but their optimal performance cannot be achieved on marginal/organic lands or without the use of external chemical inputs (fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides). Cereal breeding programs aim at evaluating candidate lines/cultivars for agronomic, disease and quality traits in a weed free environment that makes it impossible to identify traits conferring competitive ability against weeds. Moreover, quantification of competitive ability is a complex phenomenon which is affected by range of growth traits. Above (eg light) and below (eg water and nutrients) ground resources also influence competitiveness to a greater extent. Competitiveness is quantitatively inherited trait which is heavily influenced by many factors including genotype, management, environment and their interaction. Sound plant breeding techniques and good experimental designs are prerequisites for maximizing genetic gains to breed cultivars for organically managed lands. The brief is focused on breeding wheat for enhanced competitive ability along with other agronomic, genetic and molecular studies that have been undertaken to improve weed suppression, disease resistance and quality in organically managed lands. The examples from other cereals have also been highlighted to compare wheat with other cereal crops.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Utilizing games can also be very facilitating for the language teacher because of the playful atmosphere, which makes the teaching-learning process more facilitating. The data was collected by selecting five English language teachers and 150 students of class 8 from various public sector schools of Lahore. Evaluation checklist and survey questionnaire were employed as research tools. The findings obtained after an analysis revealed that games could acquaint students with new words or phrases and facilitate deep learning of vocabulary in a better and faster way in comparison to memorization. Games also help develop students\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 communicative competence. Most of the students agreed that new techniques via games had fruitful benefits in improving vocabulary.

To address these problems, in the present study a triple gene construct harboring Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, and EPSPS cassettes has been developed for plant specifically in cotton transformation against lepidopteron insect-pests and weeds. Nicotiana benthamiana (tobacco) was used as a model system for characterization of this triple gene construct. The construct has been assembled in plant expression vector and transformed in N. benthamiana. In six transgenic tobacco lines the integration of Cry1Ac-Cry2Ab-EPSPS in tobacco genome was checked by PCR, while successful protein expression of all the three genes was confirmed through immunostrip assay. Efficacy of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab was evaluated through insect bioassay using armyworm (Spodoptera littoralis). These transgenic tobacco plants showed significant insect mortality as compared to control plants during insect bioassay. Three out of six tested transgenic lines L3, L5, and L9 exhibited 100% mortality of armyworm, while three other lines L1, L10, and L7 showed 86, 80, and 40% mortality, respectively. This construct can readily be used with confidence to transform cotton and other crops for the development of insect resistant and herbicide tolerant transgenic plants.

Two types of NF membranes, namely NF90 and NF270, were employed to compare their performances for Li and magnesium (Mg) rejection under various operating conditions. In the presence of a competing ion (i.e., Mg) at different concentration, Li rejection by NF90 and NF270 membrane increased, which could be attributed to ion-shielding effects.

A major contributor is the residential sector which consumes almost 50% of the total national energy consumption every year. Environmental and economic pressures along with the Saudi Vision 2030 reform program advocate for an improvement in energy consumption patterns. For a sustainable residential sector, energy-efficient solutions should be adopted in the design process preferably based on building performance simulation (BPS). This study investigates the existing status and future prospects of BPS in the construction industry of Saudi Arabia. A survey has been carried out with building industry professionals to investigate the existing practices in terms of use of BPS. Energy and environmental savings achievable through application of BPS have been estimated by modelling a typical residential villa as a case study. The results indicate that presently BPS is not being adequately applied by the building industry and a number of barriers exist which need to be addressed. The case study simulation indicates that electricity consumption of a villa based on a BPS-based design process is 51.3% less than the existing typical residential villa.

{"title": "VSG stability and coordination enhancement under emergency condition\n", "abstract": " Renewable energy sources are integrated into a grid via inverters. Due to the absence of an inherent droop in an inverter, an artificial droop and inertia control is designed to let the grid-connected inverters mimic the operation of synchronous generators and such inverters are called virtual synchronous generators (VSG). Sudden addition, removal of load or faults in the grid causes power and frequency oscillations in the grid. The steady state droop control of VSG is not effective in dampening such oscillations. Therefore, a new control scheme, namely bouncy control, has been introduced. This control uses a variable emergency gain, to enhance or reduce the power contribution of individual VSGs during a disturbance. The maximum power contribution of an individual VSG is limited by its power rating. It has been observed that this control, successfully minimized the oscillation of electric parameters and the power system approached steady state quickly. Therefore, by implementing bouncy control, VSGs can work in coordination to make the grid more robust. The proposed controller is verified through Lyapunov stability analysis.

MOEAs employ different evolutionary operators to evolve populations of solutions for approximating the set of optimal solutions of the problem at hand in a single simulation run. Different evolutionary operators suite different problems. The use of multiple operators with a self-adaptive capability can further improve the performance of existing MOEAs. This paper suggests an enhanced version of a genetically adaptive multi-algorithm for multi-objective (AMAL-GAM) optimisation which includes differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), simulated binary crossover (SBX), Pareto archive evolution strategy (PAES) and simplex crossover (SPX) for population evolution during the course of optimization. We examine the performance of this enhanced version of AMALGAM experimentally over two different test suites, the ZDT test problems and the test instances designed recently for the special session on MOEA?s competition at the Congress of Evolutionary Computing of 2009 (CEC?09).

Still, it remains to be explored that bacterial proteins also exhibit similar recognition sequences to make them vulnerable to host defense mechanism. We employed multiple docking protocols including AUTODOCK, PatchDock, ZDOCK, DOCK/PIERR and CLUSPRO to explore the DYNLL1 and Pilin interaction followed by molecular dynamics simulation assays. Subsequent structural comparison of the predicted binding site for DYNLL1-Pilin complex against the experimentally verified DYNLL1 binding partners was performed to cross check the residual contributions and to determine the binding mode. On the basis of in silico analysis, here we describe a novel interaction of DYNLL1 and receptor binding domain of Pilin (the main protein constituent of bacterial type IV Pili) of gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO), which is the third most common nosocomial pathogen associated with the life-threatening infections. Evidently, our results underscore that Pilin specific motif (KSTQD) exhibits a close structural similarity to that of Vaccinia virus polymerase, P protein Rabies and P protein Mokola viruses. We speculate that binding of DYNLL1 to Pilin may trigger an uncontrolled inflammatory response of the host immune system during P. aeruginosa chronic infections thereby opening a new pioneering area to investigate the role of DYNLL1 in gram negative bacterial infections other than viral\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Hundreds of new technologies are being patented each year, many of which are supposed to help society directly or indirectly. Simulation of crops is thought to be a new concept, particularly in developing countries; however, it started in the late 1970s. A model is a mathematical representation of a real system, and modeling is an efficient way to learn about complex biophysical systems. Crop simulation modeling is quantitative application of a crop-based model. Crop modeling holds a vital place in the development of innovative crop management strategies and agricultural sustainability under a continuously changing climate, as it expresses the response of crops to meteorological, edaphic, and biological factors. Crop modeling aids in decision-making, forecasting of crop growth and development, minimizing the yield gaps, and selecting suitable genotypes and appropriate sowing dates for sustainable crop production under changing climatic scenarios. It is becoming a valuable tool for increasing our understanding of crop physiology and ecology for sustainable agricultural production. Models are used for yield prediction (Tsuji et al., 1994), simulation of crop damage, making policies, finding out interaction effects (Ahmed and Hassan, 2011), such as genotype by environment (G\u251c\u00f9 E) interaction (Heuvelink et al., 2007), soil moisture dynamics, nitrate losses (Liu et al., 2011), soil erosion, and other factors related to agriculture (Wang et al., 2003).

Retrieval and Indexing of content-oriented video has evolved as an intriguing research zone with the colossal development in the product of advanced digital mass media. Not with standing varying media information, text showing up in videos can assist in an effective contraption for semantic abstraction, video analysis and recovery of video data. A proficient algorithm and high quality videos of news are required for accomplishing the desired task. This paper recommends a system dependent upon gray-scale edges-features for evenly arranged English ticker text localization and extraction from news videos. The framework exploits edge based localization of text regions to concentrate text based materials from videos. For low quality videos, some contrast enhancement operations are used to enhance the video frames first and then morphological operators are applied to segment out the ticker text regions in news videos. At last, these regions are cropped from the video frames and on satisfying certain geometrical constraints, the results are acknowledged to be text regions. No assumptions about the ticker color, style of text fonts, size of text and the types of ticker is made because no standard format of tickers exist in news videos of different channels and different countries have separate style of ticker texts format and color. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a data set of CNN and BBC news videos and it displayed promising results.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The new technology gives rise to good dc and RF performances in InP-based HEMTs. Notably different from the conventional Si 3 N 4  approach, an ultrathin layer of Al 2 O 3  (15-nm) grown by atomic layer deposition is incorporated in the surface passivation, which is the main feature of this technology. After passivation, the Si 3 N 4 /Al 2 O 3 -passivated HEMTs exhibit a superior dc performance demonstrating a high drain current up to 800 mA/mm, an increased peak transconductance of 1100 mS/mm at V GS  = -0.2 V and a slight threshold voltage shift of \u256c\u00f6V th  = +120 mV. In terms of their RF performance, a maximum oscillation frequency (f max ) up to 340 GHz has been obtained, showing an excellent quality of the surface passivation.

The working scheme of the model is as: the real image data is converted into complex data by iota ( i ) times and the average iota ( i ) times of horizontal and vertical components of gradient is inserted in the model to develop complete complex gradient.

The data provided clearly show the silencing of ERK 1/2 with siRNAs and inhibition of ERK1/2 with deguelin treatment in HeLa cells. Additionally, we are providing information that deguelin binds directly to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 in the hydrophobic grooves, thereby releasing BAD and BAX from dimerization with these proteins. This results in increased apoptotic activity through the intrinsic pathway involved in rupture of mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome C. Evidence for inhibition of ERK1/2 by deguelin and escape of BAD phosphorylation at serine 112 through ERK/RSK pathway has been further fortified by obtaining similar results by silencing ERK 1/2 each with specific siRNAs. Increase in BAD after treatment with deguelin or siRNAs has been interpreted to mean that deguelin acts through several alternative pathways and therefore can be used as effective therapeutic agent.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "Role of interleukin-1 in pathogenesis of radicular cyst.\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is one of the cytokines produced by macrophages, monocytes and dentritc cells. Macrophages are present in apical granuloma and the wall of the radicular cyst. This cytokine causes the cyst expansion and is involved in proliferation of fibroblasts in the cyst wall and stimulate the fibroblasts to produce more prostaglandin. Radicular cyst is the most common cyst of the jaws which is usually associated with necrotic pulp of the tooth. The cyst formation requires proliferation of the epithelial rest cells of Malassez present in the periodontal ligament. Proliferation of epithelial rest cells of Malassez is an essential event in the Pathogenesis of radicular cyst. Objective of the study was to investigate the effect of IL-1 on epithelial cell proliferation which is an important factor in the pathogenesis of radicular cyst. METHODS: The cyst walls of 20 radicular cysts were removed and were cultured in vitro to grow the epithelial cells. The culture were rapidly contaminated and dominated by growth of fibroblasts. Therefore another cell line was used for the experiments. RESULTS: The result showed that proliferation was stimulated with increased in a biphasic manner with maximum stimulation at 1.25 nanog/ml, beyond this concentration proliferation was decreased. CONCLUSION: IL-1 had a proliferative effect on epithelial cells at low concentrations which may be playing a role in evoking an inflammatory reaction and stimulating the epithelial cell rests of Malassez to proliferate to form radicular cyst.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Many countries including Pakistan have signed the Kyoto Protocol agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) and agreed to control the release of CO2 and to increase the CO2 sequestration. Agroforestry sector can contribute efficiently in carbon sequestration. This study was carried out to determine the status and potential of agroforestry and its role in carbon sequestration under semi-arid conditions. Data was collected through a multi-objective and pre-tested questionnaire from 250 village farmers in tehsil Sumandri, Pakistan. Height and girth of trees were measured from 250 randomly selected 0.405 ha farm plots. Soil samples from each cropping pattern were collected and analyzed. The whole study area has 2069.19 Mt of above ground carbon stocks and has sequestered a total of 7579.46 Mt of carbon dioxide at the rate of 186201.85 t CO2 yr-1. Furthermore, the study area has the potential of stocking 3607.61 Mt and sequestering 13214.67 Mt of CO2 at the rate of 327232.46 t CO2 per year. According to calculations, increasing the number of farm trees/ha, average CO2 sequestration rate of the study area can be increased from 2.05 t CO2 ha-1yr-1 to 3.59 t CO2 ha-1 yr-1.

In this study, Box\u0393\u00c7\u00f4Behnken design (BBD) method was employed to investigate the combined influence of permeate flux, backwashing and relaxation duration on the performance of MBR. Based on the experimental results, quadratic models for effluent quality parameters, namely COD, NH4\u0393\u00c7\u00f4N, TN and TP removals were developed and the significance of these models was analyzed using ANOVA. Trans-membrane pressure (TMP) was monitored as the indicator of membrane fouling, and the increase in TMP was used to generate the regression model. Quadratic models based on the experimental results depicted that high permeate flux, backwashing and relaxation durations can negatively affect the performance of MBR. On the other hand, backwashing and relaxation durations were effective to minimize membrane fouling and the contribution of each tested variable was as follows: backwashing duration> permeate flux> relaxation duration. Since backwashing and relaxation durations negatively affected the removal of bulk organic and nutrients, optimization of these variable is vital for efficient performance of MBR. Based on the optimization of the variables, optimal backwashing and relaxation durations were 25 and 100 s, respectively, at a constant filtration duration of 8 min, while optimum permeate flux was 18 LMH.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Densely populated and threatened by floods and storms, Bangladesh in one of the poorer countries of the world. In Bangladesh, although 78% of total cropped area is devoted to rice production but country is still suffering from a chronic shortage of food grain (BBS, 2008). The total production of rice in Bangladesh was 34.35 million metric tons from 11.35 million hectares of land in the fiscal year 2010-2011 (BBS, 2011). There is no opportunity to increase rice area so it will require adoption of new technology to increase yield. SRI is a\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium in an axisymmetric plasma is described by the Grad-Shafranov equation in terms of the magnetic flux. A generalized Grad-Shafranov-type equation has been derived. Specific functional forms of plasma internal energy and current are used. A simplest analytical solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation is presented. This solution is over constrained both in shape and in plasma current. We demonstrate that the Shafranov shift for this solution is independent of plasma current on HT-7 superconducting Tokamak.Introduction. Plasma is an electrically conducting fluid or a gas consisting totally or partially of charged particles. At high temperatures, the highly ionized plasma is an excellent electrical conductor and can be confined and shaped by strong magnetic fields. Particular plasma configurations are described in terms of solutions of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE). In the usual Grad-Shafranov equation, the internal energy of plasma does not appear, but in the present case the internal energy appears as a quantity to be determined. Analytical solutions of the Grad-Shafranov [1, 2] equation are very useful for theoretical studies of plasma equilibrium, transport and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability. The well-known Solovyev equilibrium [3] has been extensively used for such studies and also as a benchmark of numerical codes that allow to find more general solutions.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["27"]}

These are suitable to design ABS structures for applications that are operated under static or dead loads. Still, comprehensive research is required to determine the properties and behavior of ABS structures under dynamic loads, especially in the presence of temperature more than the ambient. The presented research was an effort mainly to provide any evidence about the structural behavior and damage resistance of ABS material if operated under dynamic load conditions coupled with relatively high-temperature values.

However, cotton yield is affected by a sap-sucking insect Bemisia tabaci (whitefly), and whitefly-borne cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD).

Unfortunately, the extensively cultivated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) species are highly susceptible and vulnerable to CLCuD. Yet, the concomitant influence of whitefly and CLCuD on the susceptible G. hirsutum transcriptome has not been interpreted. In the present study we have employed an RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) transcriptomics approach to explore the differential gene expression in susceptible G. hirsutum variety upon infection with viruliferous whiteflies.

This has directed a large research community to optimize point cloud storage requirements by preserving the original structure of data with an acceptable attenuation rate. Point cloud compression algorithms were developed to occupy less storage space by focusing on features such as color, texture, and geometric information. In this work, we propose a novel lossy point cloud compression and decompression algorithm that optimizes storage space requirements by preserving geometric information of the scene. Segmentation is performed by using a region growing segmentation algorithm. The points under the boundary of the surfaces are discarded that can be recovered through the polynomial equations of degree one in the decompression phase. We have compared the proposed technique with existing techniques using publicly available datasets for indoor architectural scenes.

For this, data were collected from 742 Chinese tourists who purchased goods at duty free shops while traveling in Korea within the past year using an online survey company\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s system in China. The results indicated that pragmatic, hedonic, and sociability experiences have a positive influence on travelers\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 well-being perceptions. In addition, travelers\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 well-being perceptions aided the enhancement of brand attitude and brand preference, which in turn positively affected word-of-mouth. Novelty is the originality of this study as very few studies on this topic are presented in the extant literature and practical implications are also discussed.

{"title": "Development of Aggression Detection Technique in Social Media\n", "abstract": " Due to the enormous growth of social media the potential of social media mining has increased exponentially. Individual users are producing data at unprecedented rate by sharing and interacting through social media. This user generated data provides opportunities to explore what people think and express on social media. Users exhibit different behaviors on social media towards individuals, a group, a topic or an activity. In this paper, we present a social media mining approach to perform behavior analytics. In this research study, we performed a descriptive analysis of user generated data such as users\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 status, comments and replies to identify individual users or groups which can be a potential threat. Tokenization technique is used to estimate the polarity of the behavior of different users by considering their comments or feedbacks against different posts on Facebook. The proposed approach can help to identify possible threats reflected by the user\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s behavior towards a specific event. To evaluate the approach, a data set was developed containing comments on the Facebook from different users in different groups. The dataset was divided into different groups such as political, religious and sports. Most negative users\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 in different groups were identified successfully. In our research, we focused only on English content; however, it can be evaluated with other languages.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["27"]}
{"title": "Spata: Strong pseudonym-based authentication in intelligent transport system\n", "abstract": " Intelligent transport system (ITS) is generally deployed to improve road safety, comfort, security, and traffic efficiency. A robust mechanism of authentication and secure communication is required to protect privacy and conditional resolution of pseudonyms to revoke malicious vehicles. In a typical ITS framework, a station can be a vehicle, road side unit, or a server that can participate in communication. During authentication, the real identity of an intelligent transport system station, referred to as a vehicle, should not be revealed in order to preserve its privacy. In this paper, we propose a Strong Pseudonym-based AutenTicAtion (SPATA) framework for preserving the real identity of vehicles. The distributed architecture of SPATA allows vehicles to generate pseudonyms in a very private and secure way. In the absence of a distributed architecture, the privacy cannot be preserved by storing information regarding vehicles\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Consumers of milk and milk products from mastitic animals are at high risk of foodborne infections. Escalating antibiotic resistance strived us to explore the alternate option to control mastitis. In ongoing era, bacteriophages are an alternate possible effective remedy. Therefore, in this study the infection ability of three lytic phages SA, SANF and SA2 was determined against ten isolates of Staphylococci and one Micrococcus, isolated from five raw milk samples. Their morphological, biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that two strains were S. aureus, while all others were different coagulase negative Staphylococci. Their sensitivity against three phages indicated broad host range of phages SANF and SA2, and relatively narrow host range of phage SA. Phage SNAF showed an effective growth reduction of S. aureus RP isolate, compared with other bacteriophages.

Furthermore, different productivities of CNCs can be obtained on the alumina spheres with diameters of 2 mm, 1 mm and 500 \u256c\u255dm. It is discovered that on decreasing the diameter of alumina spheres, the thickness of the carbon layer is also decreased, resulting in a negative effect on the yield of the CNCs. A high yield of CNCs grown on 500 \u256c\u255dm alumina spheres can be achieved by increasing the catalyst concentration to improve the thickness of the carbon layer.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Due to shortage of fuel oil and its sky touching prices, it seems very uneconomical to generate electricity from fuel oil. In order to generate cheap electricity we have to rely on renewable energy resources. To address these challenges, wind power generation is among the popular options in the world which is now being considered in Pakistan as well. However unremitting change in wind speed from calm to stormy introduces real challenges. Storing wind energy in batteries during the periods of low demand seems an expensive option, especially when dealing with large scale power generation. Due to incessantly varying nature of wind speed, it is not feasible to rely only on wind power for cheap power production. Also, it is not thriftily possible to construct separate transmission line. However if we integrate wind power with hydro power, we can utilize the maximum possible transmission capacity. Existing hydro power station operating in that area or pumped storage scheme can be used. This paper is an attempt to analyze coordination of wind generation with hydro power in those areas of Pakistan where both wind and hydro power sources exist. In this paper, different issues have been analyzed taking case study of Dargai.

Distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkylnaphthalenes, alkylphenanthrenes, alkyldibenzothiophenes, and aromatic biomarkers were reported from aromatic fractions of the crude oils. The aromatic hydrocarbons parameters revealed a higher thermal maturity of OM of source rock-generated Lower Indus Basin oils. Calculated vitrinite reflectance values from the methylphenanthrenes index 1 (MPI-1) and methyldibenzothiophene ratio (MDR) indicate that most of the oils reached a late oil generation window of thermal maturity.

{"title": "Direct physical interaction of active Ras with mSIN1 regulates mTORC2 signaling\n", "abstract": " The mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR), a Ser/Thr kinase, associates with different subunits forming two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, regulating a diverse set of cellular functions in response to growth factors, cellular energy levels, and nutrients. The mechanisms regulating mTORC1 activity are well characterized; regulation of mTORC2 activity, however, remains obscure. While studies conducted in Dictyostelium suggest a possible role of Ras protein as a potential upstream regulator of mTORC2, definitive studies delineating the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly in mammalian cells, are still lacking. Protein levels were measured by Western blotting and kinase activity of mTORC2 was analyzed by in vitro kinase assay. In situ Proximity ligation assay (PLA) and co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to detect protein-protein interaction. Protein localization was investigated by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation while cellular function of mTORC2 was assessed by assaying extent of cell migration and invasion. Here, we present experimental evidence in support of the role of Ras activation as an upstream regulatory switch governing mTORC2 signaling in mammalian cancer cells. We report that active Ras through its interaction with mSIN1 accounts for mTORC2 activation, while disruption of this interaction by genetic means or via peptide-based competitive hindrance, impedes mTORC2 signaling. Our study defines the regulatory role played by Ras during mTORC2 signaling in mammalian cells and highlights the importance of Ras-mSIN1 interaction in the assembly\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "Feasible protection strategy for HVDC system by means of SFCL and passive resonance DC breaker\n", "abstract": " The key obstacle in implementing high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid, which is considered as the future of power grid, is the absence of effective DC circuit breaker (DCCB). At present, HVDC grid could be based on half-bridge (HB) or full-bridge (FB) voltage source converter (VSC). Among these two converter topologies, FB topology has an advantage of reverse current blocking at a much higher cost compared to HB technology and still requires a DCCB for isolating the faulty line. Therefore, HB technology is more realistic to implement HVDC grid economically if DC fault current could be controlled more effectively. In this respect, this article suggests feasible fault protection strategy based on superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) and passive resonance circuit breaker (PRCB) which could be applied effectively to HB system.

{"title": "Assessment of overvoltage and insulation coordination in mixed HVDC transmission lines exposed to lightning strikes\n", "abstract": " Many geographical constraints and aesthetic concerns necessitate the partial use of cable sections in the High Voltage DC (HVDC) transmission line, resulting in a mixed transmission line. The overhead sections of mixed lines are exposed to lightning strikes. The lightning strikes can not only result in flashover of overhead line (OHL) insulators but can enter the cable and permanently damage its insulation if adequate insulation coordination measures are not taken. In this work, we have analyzed the factors that affect the level of overvoltage inside the cable by simulating a fast front model in PSCAD. It has been determined that surge arresters must be provided at cable terminals when the length of cable sections is less than 16 km to limit the core-ground overvoltage within the lightning impulse protective level (LIPL). The level of sheath-ground overvoltage is independent of the length of cable; however, it can be limited within LIPL by lowering the sheath grounding impedance to 1.2 \u0393\u00e4\u00aa.

The results reveal that there is strong long-run causality running from energy consumption and economic growth to carbon emissions. We also find a short-run feedback causality between carbon emissions and economic growth. It is also evident from the results that there is no causality between carbon emissions and energy consumption in the short-run and a unidirectional short-run causality running from energy consumption to economic growth. The findings of Variance Decomposition Analysis and Impulse Response Functions reinforce causality results. Since the study supports the\" growth hypothesis\", the author recommends a policy of comprehensive energy use transformation program wherein the government should subsidize the renewable sources of energy and tax the fossil fuels, and invest heavily in green technology.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Mean, range and coefficient of variation indicated that S1 and S2 progenies of `UAF' random mated sunflower population contained large amounts of variability for all traits. The estimates of genotypic variances were smaller than their corresponding phenotypic variances, revealing presence of environmental components. The genotypic variances among S1 and S2 progenies were significant for all the traits evaluated when tested with their respective standard error. The estimates of environmental variances for indicated traits among S1 and S2 progenies remained low in value compared to their respective genotypic and phenotypic variances. The estimates of broad- sense heritability for all the traits evaluated were comparatively greater among S2 progenies. However, the heritab  ility of all the plant traits when tested with their respective standard error were found to be significant for both S1 and S2 progenies. The estimates of genetic correlation coefficients were found greater in value than: the phenotypic correlation coefficients for all the indicated traits for both S1 and S2 progenies of sunflower. Among S1 progenies of sunflower, seed yield was found positively and significantly correlated with all the traits studied at both phenotypic and genetic levels except with oil content which was positive but non-significant at genetic level.

This paper proposes a systematic approach to reduce the computational complexity of HEVC based on an ensemble of online and offline Random Forests classifiers. A reduced set of features for training the Random Forests classifier is proposed, based on the rankings obtained from information gain and a wrapper-based approach. The best model parameters are also obtained through a consistent and generalizable method.

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of HF is very expensive and need high level of human expertise. Hence, there is a dire need of development of automated methods for diagnosis of HF with high accuracy and lower computational cost. To reduce the time complexity of the machine learning model established for detection of HF, in this paper, a hybrid diagnostic system is developed. The proposed hybrid model hybridizes two models i.e., L 1  regularized support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model. The SVM model is used to remove redundant features or features which are not relevant while the LDA model is used as classifier to classify the input feature vector as that of healthy or diseased person. The elimination of irrelevant features from features space reduces the time complexity of the predictive model, thus, reduces its training time.

{"title": "Bioactivity-guided isolation of rosmarinic acid as the principle bioactive compound from the butanol extract of Isodon rugosus against the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum\n", "abstract": " Aphids are agricultural pest insects that transmit viruses and cause feeding damage on a global scale. Current pest control practices involving the excessive use of synthetic insecticides over many years have resulted in aphid resistance to a number of pesticides. In nature, plants produce secondary metabolites during their interaction with insects and these metabolites can act as toxicants, antifeedants, anti-oviposition agents and deterrents towards the insects. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the butanol fraction from a crude methanolic extract of an important plant species, Isodon rugosus showed strong insecticidal activity against the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. To further explore this finding, the current study aimed to exploit a bioactivity-guided strategy to isolate and identify the active compound in the butanol fraction of I. rugosus. As such, reversed-phase flash chromatography, acidic extraction and different spectroscopic techniques were used to isolate and identify the new compound, rosmarinic acid, as the bioactive compound in I. rugosus. Insecticidal potential of rosmarinic acid against A. pisum was evaluated using standard protocols and the data obtained was analyzed using qualitative and quantitative statistical approaches. Considering that a very low concentration of this compound (LC90 = 5.4 ppm) causes significant mortality in A. pisum within 24 h, rosmarinic acid could be exploited as a potent insecticide against this important pest insect. Furthermore, I. rugosus is already used for medicinal purposes and rosmarinic acid is known to reduce genotoxic effects induced by chemicals, hence it is expected to be safer\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The flow is generated by the shear stress given on the bottom plate of the channel. The authors have developed a generalized model on the basis of constitutive equations described by the time-fractional Caputo\u0393\u00c7\u00f4Fabrizio derivative. Many authors have published different results by applying the time-fractional derivative to the local part of acceleration in the momentum equation. This approach of the fractional models does not have sufficient physical background. By using fractional generalized constitutive equations, we have developed a proper model to investigate exact analytical solutions corresponding to the channel flow of a generalized viscous fluid. The exact solutions for velocity field and shear stress are obtained by using Laplace transform and Fourier integral transformation, for three different cases namely (i) constant shear,(ii) ramped type shear and (iii) oscillating shear.

A pot experiment was designed to analyze the growth and germination potential of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus citriodora against the drought stress via completely randomized designed experiment with four replications along with four stress intervals. Seedlings were raised in pots by irrigating at four different levels ie 1 day (Wo), 5 day's (W1), 10 day's (W2) and 15 day's (W3). Several morphological parameters were studied. The plant height of both the species was maximum when the plants were irrigated after 1 day time interval and it gradually decreased as the irrigation interval increased. Root length varied drastically against the influence of the drought. Maximum root length 6.5 cm was observed in E. camaldulensis when the water was applied after 1 day interval followed by the E. citriodora yielding 6.1 cm of the root length against the same treatment. As the irrigation interval increased, the shoot fresh weight decreased leading to the minimum value for the shoot fresh weight at the treatment W3. Root dry weight was more as compared to E. citriodora for all treatments. Maximum root-shoot ratio (5.2) was observed in E. camaldulensis when the water was applied after 5 day interval (W1).

Under stress conditions, plant growth is affected by a number of factors such as hormonal and nutritional imbalance, ion toxicity, physiological disorders and susceptibility to disease. Plant growth under stress conditions may be enhanced by the application of microbial inoculation including PGPR. These microbes can promote plant growth by regulating nutritional and hormonal balance, producing plant growth regulators and solubilizing nutrients. In addition to their interactions with plants, these microbes also show synergistic interactions with other microbes in the soil environment. These interactions may be vital for sustainable agriculture because they mainly depend on biological process rather than on agrochemicals to maintain plant growth and development as well as proper health under stress conditions.

Emission of harmful gases during the process of electricity generation leads to greenhouse affects. However, by employing photovoltaic (PV) panels, electricity can be generated without creating air, noise and water pollution caused by the emission of harmful gases. Geographically, Pakistan is located in a region of the world where solar irradiance is approximately 2000 KWh/m2. In recent decades, grid-connected PV power plants have been implemented worldwide to fulfill the power requirements. Usually, these power plants are mounted fixed. However, with advancement in technology solar trackers have increased the yield. In this study, after reviewing and analyzing various PV tracking techniques, an open-loop single axis technique is suggested for use in the huge PV power plants.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["27"]}

There are a wide variety of 3D printing technologies, eg stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modelling (FDM). The method of 3D printing applied in this research incorporates the strengths of FDM and SLA printing. This hybrid 3D printing technique uses extruded photopolymer in a similar configuration to an FDM printer. The photopolymer used here is UV Dome 58\u0393\u00c7\u00f4a proprietary epoxy urethane and the filler is fumed silica. By using an extrusion nozzle similar to FDM printers, photopolymer resin was deposited on a build plate. The extruded polymer was then cured solid on demand by exposure to ultraviolet light (UV) light. Dog-bone samples of specific dimensions were 3D printed by extruding the photopolymer with different parameters to characterize its mechanical properties. The experimental results show that lower print speed provided smooth surfaces and higher extrusion multiplier was correlated with higher ultimate tensile stress, whereas UV light intensity of 1 Watt proved to be very effective for curing the material. This print technique allows the possibility for 3D free-form printing, which will be unique from current printing systems.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The term masonry also refer to the units themselves. The common materials of masonry units are brick, stone, marble, granite, travertine, limestone, cast stone, concrete block, glass block, stucco, and tile. Masonry unit are bound generally with a highly durable form of construction. However, the materials used, the quality of the mortar and workmanship, and the pattern in which the units are assembled can significantly affect the durability of the overall masonry construction.. Mainly the weakest part of a masonry wall is the mortar joint, as the substitution of lime for aggregate reduces the overall strength of the joint. The need to butter and precisely fit each block necessitates the use of skilled, and typically highly paid, masons. Also, the mortar used to butter the units often hardens on the inside of openings within the blocks, preventing or hindering the insertion of insulation and/or reinforcements within the openings. One solution to the lack of strength of mortar joints has been to dry stack the masonry units. However, dry stacking of walls is not without drawbacks. First, like the staking of mortar walls, care must be taken to ensure that the units are properly aligned with one another. This can be a painstaking process that greatly increases the time required to build such a wall. Second, the lack of motor in the joints between units allows air to easily pass through the joints and requires that a skin or other air barrier be used in connection with the walls.

However, interruption of the DC fault is still a challenge due to fast di/dt and extremely high levels of DC fault current. The fault interruption using a DC circuit breaker (DCCB) causes enormous energy dissipation and voltage stress across the DCCB. Therefore, the use of a fault current limiter is essential, and the superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is the most promising choice. Past literature has focused on the operating characteristics of DCCB or limiting characteristics of the SFCL. However, there is little understanding about the fault interruption and system recovery characteristics considering both DCCB and SFCL. In this paper, we have presented a comparative study on fault interruption and system recovery characteristics considering three types of fault limiting devices in combination with circuit breaker. The transient analyses of AC and DC system have been performed, to suggest the most preferable protection scheme. It has been concluded that, amongst the three fault limiting devices, the Hybrid SFCL in combination with circuit breaker, delivers the most desirable performance in terms of interruption time, recovery time, energy dissipation and voltage transients.

This study aimed to assess the molecular mechanisms of action, and to further evaluate the antiangiogenic effect of this extract. NAFLD was induced by eight weeks of high-fat diet, and treatment was applied for four weeks. Antiangiogenic activity was assessed by aortic ring assay and by in vitro tests. Our findings demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of 50% ME among NAFLD rats, were associated with a significant increase in serum adiponectin, reduction in the serum levels of RBP4, vaspin, progranulin, TNF-\u256c\u2592, IL-6, and significant downregulation of the hepatic gene expression of PPAR\u256c\u2502, SLC10A2, and Coll\u256c\u25921.

To reduce the cost and size of the hardware, the pressure and temperature information is processed with a single integrated circuit (IC) and transmitted at the same time to the electronic control unit (ECU) through SENT. Due to its digital nature, it is immune to noise, has reduced sensitivity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), and generates low EMI. It requires only one PAD for its connectivity with ECU, and thus reduces the pin requirements, simplifies the connectivity, and minimizes the printed circuit board (PCB) complexity. The design is fully synthesizable, and independent of technology. The finite state machine-based approach is employed for area efficient implementation, and to translate the proposed architecture into hardware. The IC is fabricated in 1P6M 180 nm CMOS process with an area of (116 \u256c\u255dm\u251c\u00f9 116 \u256c\u255dm) and 4.314 K gates.

With recent advancements in digital technology, the computational demands of such applications have increased enormously. In this paper we are presenting a high throughput digital cross correlator, capable of processing 1-bit digitized stream, at the rate of up to 2 GHz, simultaneously on 64 channels ie, approximately 4 Trillion correlation and accumulation operations per second. In order to achieve higher throughput, we have focused on frequency based partitioning of our design and tried to minimize and localize high frequency operations. This correlator is designed for a Passive Millimeter Wave Imager intended for the detection of contraband items concealed on human body. The goals are to increase the system bandwidth, achieve video rate imaging, improve sensitivity and reduce the size. Design methodology is detailed in subsequent sections, elaborating the techniques enabling high throughput. The design is verified for Xilinx Kintex UltraScale device in simulation and the implementation results are given in terms of device utilization and power consumption estimates. Our results show considerable improvements in throughput as compared to our baseline design, while the correlator successfully meets the functional requirements.

{"title": "A generalized multi-layer framework for video coding to select prediction parameters\n", "abstract": " The famous video coding standards of this era, such as high efficiency video coding (HEVC) and H.264/AVC, offer numerous coding parameters to enhance the compression ratio. These standards exploited a robust rate-distortion optimization (RDO) methodology to select the appropriate macroblock (MB) coding parameters, such as prediction type, modes, and block sizes. The exploitation of the RDO technique contributes significantly to increase the computational complexity of the coding process. In this paper, a generalized multi-layer framework is presented, which provides a hierarchical optimized way to select MB prediction parameters. Each layer of the proposed framework incorporates multiple innovative algorithms to shortlist the candidate prediction parameters prior to the RDO process.

Representative samples of cohesive soils were collected from the Mansehra and Balakot areas of Hazara, Pakistan and their major geotechnical properties determined following the standard ASTM procedures. The determined properties include the Atterberg limits, ie Liquid Limit (LL), Plastic Limit (PL), Plasticity Index (PI), and Maximum dry density, Optimum moisture contents, Un-confined compressive strength, Activity and Expansion. Both the soils are classified as active soils possessing high expansion capacity and low strength due to the presence of Ca-montmorillonites. Following an increment of 5%, up to 25% streaks of cutting waste from Susalgali and Baffa granites were added to the Mansehra soil and Balakot soil respectively. A thorough analysis of the test results reveals a continuous decrease in the Atterberg limits, optimum moisture contents and expansion capacity, and increase in the maximum dry density and overall strength of both the soils with increasing amounts of the added granite cutting waste streaks. The reduction in Atterberg limits, optimum moisture contents and expansion capacity reflects the low activity and lower absorption capacity of the added granite. Besides, the concomitant increase in strength and maximum dry density of the treated soils suggests suitability of granite waste addition as a potential means for enhancing bearing capacity and reducing settlement issues in civil engineering.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["27"]}

This is due to worldwide usage of smart devices, availability of fast internet connections, and the popularity of social media. The Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are, therefore, facing problems in handling this huge traffic flow. Each type of traffic, including real-time video, audio, and text has its own Quality of Services (QoS) requirements which, if not met, may cause a sufficient loss of profit. Offloading of these traffics can be made more efficient so that values of QoS parameters are enhanced. In this work, we propose an incentive-based game-theoretic frame work for downloading data. The download of each type of data will get an incentive determined by the two-stage Stackelberg game. We model the communication among single Mobile Base Station (MBS) and multiple Access Points (APs) in a crowded metropolitan environment. The leader offers an economic incentive based on the traffic type and followers respond to the incentive and offload traffic accordingly. The model optimizes strategies of both the MBS and APs in order to make the best use of their utilities. For the analysis, we have used a combination of analytical and experimental methods. The numerical outcome characterized a direct process of the best possible offloading ratio and legalized the efficiency of the proposed game. Optimal incentives and optimal offloading was the achievement of our proposed game-theoretic approach.

This study was conducted to determine the carbon sequestration potential and carbon storage difference among different tree species at early stage. Second objective of this study was to observe the effects of trees on the physicochemical properties of soils. Seedlings of fifteen widely planted farm trees species were planted under same set of climatic and soil conditions. Employing tree biomass after two year of planting (2014-2016), carbon stocks and carbon sequestration rates were calculated. Soil samples were collected under each tree species at two depths: 0-15cm and 16-30 cm, to determine the physico-chemical properties of soils such as pH, EC, N, P, K, C and organic matter (OM).

An insect specific, spider venom peptide\u2567\u00eb-HXTX-Hv1a (Hvt) was successfully expressed in cotton plants. The cotton plants producing Hvt protein have demonstrated resistance against economically important insect pest species. The study was performed to assess the effects of Hvt producing cotton plants on Honey bees (Apis mellifera).Methods: Three approaches were used to evaluate the effects of Hvt protein on adults of honeybees; whole plant assays in flight cages, in vitro assays with pollen of Hvt-cotton, and assays with elevated levels of purified Hvt protein. Pollens of Bt cotton or purified Bt proteins were used as control.Results: The field experiments did not yield any meaningful data due to high rate of mortality in all treatments including the control. However, the laboratory experiments provided conclusive results in which Hvt, purified or in pollens, did not affect the survival or longevity of the bees compared to the control. During the course of study we were able to compare the quality, effectiveness and economics of different experiments.Conclusions: We conclude that Hvt either purified or produced in cotton plants do not affect the survival or longevity of honey bees. We are also of the view that starting at laboratory level assays not only gives meaningful data but also saves a lot of time and money that can be spent on other important questions regarding safety of a particular transgenic crop. Hence, a purpose-based, tiered approach could be the best choice for pre-release ERA of IR-GMCs.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Different factors have been found associated with inciting shisham dieback. Fungal pathogens have been recognized as the major causal organism but changing climate is a main threat to forest dieback. Sexually (seedlings) and asexually (cuttings) propagated shisham were inoculated with the different fungi (Fusarium solani, Botryodiplodia theobromae, Curvularia lunata and Ganoderma lucidum). As environmental factors play critical role in the development of the disease, so the present study was designed to observe the impact of rainfall, temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity on the disease and for the management of disease predictive model was developed. A significant negative correlation was observed between disease and relative humidity both for seedlings (r=-0.97) and cuttings (r=-0.487), respectively while maximum temperature expressed significant positive correlation with seedlings and cuttings with coefficient of correlation r= 0.734 and r= 0.629, respectively. Path analysis expressed that with one unit increase in rainfall the disease would rise by 7.58 and 15.04 and for maximum temperature it was 2.47 and 5.27 units in seedlings and cuttings, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that coefficient of determination (R2) value was 0.62 and 0.48 for cuttings and seedlings, respectively.

Conclusions: According to this study, Student\u251c\u00f3  s career decision was mainly influenced by the desire of their family. There should be an official research division in every medical college and university to encourage students towards research. It can be concluded that there is yet less inclination of medical students towards research so there is need to facilitate students towards research in medical sciences by mentorship and developing better research infrastructure in medical universities.\u251c\u00e9", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Spate irrigation is in practice in Pakistan, where, flood water, during monsoon season, gets generated and channelized from down-hill countered profiles (catchments area). These hill torrential are diverted to agriculture fields, by constructing earthen embankments or related hydraulic concrete structures. Since, hill sides torrential are unpredictable, temporally and spatially matrix, which poses numerous challenges to the farmers who in return forcibly integrate/pool up individual resources to partially manage this scarce resource. Though the annual rainfall (.... 100... mm/year) in this area is low and uncertain yet at the same time due to terrain lay out, substantial quantum of water gets accumulated due to downhill side terrain profile each rainfall event. The agriculture activities, in these areas are totally dependent on such type of phenomenal rainfalls. Unfortunately, due to lack of scientific water resource management and modern agriculture practices, major quantum of torrential flood water is not only gets wasted, but also causes huge losses to human life and property. This catastrophic situation arises, as there are neither successive layers of check-dams on the down-hill sides of these mountain ranges, nor any kind of water storage facilities exist at the foot hill areas.

{"title": "Androgenesis: A fascinating doubled haploid production process\n", "abstract": " Androgenesis is one of the most important methods that have been extensively used in plant breeding programs to produce double haploids. It involves the induction of microspore embryogenesis that leads to the development of a haploid embryo instead of mature pollen grain. The microspore embryogenesis is usually brought about by modifying the environmental conditions of anthers/microspores by reprogramming their gametophytic pathway towards sporophytic growth and development. Under natural conditions, the microspore develops into a mature pollen grain that comprises of generative and vegetative nuclei. The generative nucleus develops into two sperm nuclei. Thus, the sporophytic development should be started before the onset of cell division when the gamete cells in the microspores are still totipotent. However, the embryogenic stage of microspores varies greatly among species (Touraev\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "Assessment of Appropriate MMC Topology Considering DC Fault Handling Performance of Fault Protection Devices\n", "abstract": " The eventual goal of high-voltage direct-voltage (HVDC) systems is to implement HVDC grids. The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has been identified as the best candidate for the realization of an HVDC grid by eliminating the shortcomings of conventional voltage source converter (VSC) technology. The related research has focused on efficient control schemes, new MMC topologies, and operational characteristics of an MMC in a DC grid, but there is little understanding about the fault handling capability of two mainstream MMC topologies, ie, half bridge (HB) and full bridge (FB) MMCs in combination with an adequate protection device. Contrary to the existing research where the fault location is usually fixed (center of the line), this paper considered a variable fault location on the DC line, so as to compare the fault interruption time and maximum fault current magnitude. From the point of view of fault interruption, AC and DC side transient analyses were performed for both MMC topologies to suggest the appropriate topology. The simulation result confirmed that the fault handling performance of an HB-MMC with a DC circuit breaker is superior due to the smaller fault current magnitude, faster interruption time, lower overvoltage magnitude, and lesser stresses on the insulation of the DC grid.

The temperature of globe is increasing day by day and an average increase in temperature may suddenly affect the activity of crops. Pakistan is a developing country which is heavily based on cereal crops to feed its growing population. Maize (Zea Mays) is a third major crop in Pakistan after wheat and rice that meet the country nutritional needs. The current study was conducted to simulate the impacts of climate change on the growth of maize crop through CERES-Maize model since 1976-2008. However, higher grain yield was simulated under the absolute effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. While, a significant yield decrease was simulated with the increase in temperature due to the shortening of growth period as compared to the recent conditions. For the study period, a significantly decreased yield was simulated with an increase in irrigation rate, ET, drainage rate and nitrogen leaching in the absence of direct impact of atmospheric CO2 concentration on photosynthesis rate. Anyhow, simulations of model revealed that the maize crop yield could be increased under optimum irrigation against traditional irrigation because of nitrogen leaching reduction in the recent climate, as well as in the future applied climatic scenarios (A1B and B1). Even in the A1B scenario for the period of 2025 and 2050 with the highest warming trend and assumed CO2 concentration the recent levels of obtained crop yield could be kept or even increased. Through this approach, we will be able to predict the impacts of changing temperature and carbon dioxide concentration on\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["27"]}

However, because the propagation of Wi-Fi signals is greatly affected by the serious NLOS (non-line-of sight) effect for indoor environment. Therefore, the accuracy measure is deteriorated due to random NLOS effect in indoor wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a localization algorithm which is different from existing algorithms because no priori knowledge is required about NLOS conditions when working with the proposed algorithm. It utilizes both TOA (time-of-arrival) and received-signal-strength (RSS) measurements to get an optimized range of data based on the difference of two geometric area. And, then substitute this optimized data into the triangle centroid algorithm to perform positioning operation.

Fiber morphogenesis in cotton is a complex process involving a large number of genes expressed throughout fiber development process. The expression profiling of five gene families in various cotton tissues was carried out through real time PCR. Expression analysis revealed that transcripts of expansin, tubulin and E6 were elevated from 5 to 20 days post anthesis (DPA) fibers. Three Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) including LTP1, LTP3, LTP7 exhibited highest expression in 10-20 DPA fibers. Transcripts of LTP3 were detected in fibers and non fiber tissues that of LTP7 were almost negligible in non fiber tissues. Sucrose phosphate synthase gene showed highest expression in 10 DPA fibers while sucrose synthse (susy) expressed at higher rate in 5-20 DPA fibers as well as roots. The results reveal that most of fiber related genes showed high expression in 5-20 DPA fibers. Comprehensive expression study may help to determine tissue and stage specificity of genes under study. The study may also help to explore complex process of fiber development and understand the role of these genes in fiber development process. Highly expressed genes in fibers may be transformed in cotton for improvement of fiber quality traits. Genes that were expressed specifically in fibers or other tissues could be used for isolation of upstream regulatory sequences.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["27"]}

On the other hand, there is contention between personalization and privacy. This leads to the question of how to maximize the user's experience of personalized mobile services while keeping their privacy. One possible solution is to provide user's control of their personal data by keeping their user model on their personal mobile devices. In this way, a user can scrutinize the data while sharing with service providers depending on her/his requirements. The client-side personalization approach can shift the control of privacy to the users and can involve them in personalization process.

{"title": "Spectrum Sensing Techniques for 2-hop Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks: Comparative Analysis\n", "abstract": " Spectrum sensing is an important aspect of cognitive radio systems. In order to efficiently utilize the spectrum, the role of spectrum sensing is essential in cognitive radio networks. The transmitter detection based techniques: energy detection, cyclostationary feature detection, and matched filter detection, is most commonly used for the spectrum sensing. The Energy detection technique is implemented in the 2-hop cooperative cognitive radio network in which Orthogonal Space Time Block Coding (OSTBC) is applied with the Decode and Forward (DF) protocol at the cognitive relays. The Energy detection technique is simplest and gives good results at the higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values. However, at the low SNR values its performance degrades. Moreover, each transmitter detection technique has a SNR threshold, below which it fails to work robustly. This thesis aims to find the most reliable and accurate spectrum sensing technique in the 2-hop cooperative cognitive radio network. Using Matlab simulations, a comparative analysis of three transmitter detection techniques has been made in terms of higher probability of detection. In order to remove the shortcomings faced by all the three techniques, the Fuzzy-combined logic sensing approach is also implemented and compared with transmitter detection techniques.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["27"]}

This project is focusing on pre-existing crack with assumption that no microscopic defects are presents. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) is used to evaluate the Stress Intensity Factor (SIF) of the specimen. Further analysis is done by incorporating Elastic Plastic Fracture Mechanics (EPFM) to understand the crack growth over period of time. In this study, the important parameters in fracture mechanics such as Stress Intensity Factor (SIF), Crack Mouth Opening Displacement (CMOD), J Integral and stable crack growth are been investigated. A complex loading simulation of NKS-3 specimen is done using finite element modeling. The NKS-3 is a thick-tube used in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) which has a circumferential flaw on its inner surface.

Diaromatic and triaromatic hydrocarbons were separated from highly complex mixture of sedimentary organic matter by using liquid chromatography techniques such as column chromatography, TLC and GC-FID. These classes of compounds were identified to alkylated isomers of naphthalenes and phenanthrenes by using reference chromatograms and literature data. High concentration of di-, tri-and tetra-methyl naphthalenes was observed in all crude oils except Kal# 1. The relative increase in concentration of alkyl naphthalenes was found as moved to higher methyl substituted isomers. This suggests that they are the product of sedimentary alkylation reactions during catagensis and metagensis. The significant concentration of methyl phenanthrenes indicated source of organic matter. High levels of both 1-MP and 9-MP showed marine and terrestrial source of organic matter except Umer crude oil which is most likely to have terrestrial origin.

Both sexes are affected, middle age to elderly being the commonest age group. A variety of causes have been implicated as responsible for this condition, but most of the times it is difficult to isolate one, and hence most of the times a battery of investigations proves to be a clinical exercise. A number of treatment protocols have been suggested and used over the years, based on presumed etiological theories, claiming varying degrees of success. METHODS: Relevant literature available on the net regarding the management and the efficacy of various treatment regimens for ISSNHL was critically analyzed by the authors (who are professorial staff of a medical college and consultants of a teaching hospital) to develop a consensus and recommendations on the most appropriate protocol. RESULTS: It was asserted that various treatment regimens have not proved beyond doubt to be superior to one another or spontaneous recovery rates. CONCLUSION: SSNHL is a medical emergency that entails thorough investigations to search for a possible cause and institution of appropriate therapy. Failing identifying a cause, ie idiopathic group, combination therapy with steroids and antiviral drugs could prove beneficial provided treatment is instituted early.

Since chemical control is one of a significant practice to manage insect pest in cotton. However, this kind of practice may impair the natural control provided by generalist predator C. carnea. Although, natural control adoption is limited in crops, area and season due to wide-spread use of insecticides but presence of resistance potential in C. carnea may improve the design of solid IPM strategies. Herein, we aimed to assess the toxicity of four insecticides to two strains of C. carnea (viz. laboratory reared and field collected adults) and to evaluate their resistance potential by calculating their resistance ratio. LC50 was calculated at 24 h following topical application administered when the adults were 3 days old. Control adult mortalities were less than 10% at 24 h. The LC50 values (\u252c\u2561l mL-1) for laboratory reared strains of each tested insecticide were: acetamiprid, 0.0064; bifenthrin, 3.75; chlorpyrifos, 0.067; and profenofos, 0.052. The LC50 values for field collected strains were 0.096 (acetamiprid), 34.8 (bifenthrin), 0.21 (chlorpyrifos) and 0.44 (profenofos). The toxicity of the test insecticide to C. carnea from more to least toxic was acetamiprid> profenofos> chlorpyrifos> bifenthrin. Field collected strain possessed 15 (acetamiprid)-, 9.28 (bifenthrin)-, 3.13 (chlorpyrifos)-, and 8.5 (profenofos)-fold more resistance than the susceptible population.

With the limitation of computational resources at the centralized aggregator, some grouped MTC devices data offloaded to the nearby base station collocated with the mobile edge-computing server. As a sensing capability adopted on MTC devices, we use a power exponential function model to compute a correlation coefficient existing between the MTC devices. Based on this framework, we compare the energy consumption when all data processed locally at centralized aggregator or offloaded at mobile edge computing server with optimal solution obtained by the brute force method. Then, the simulation results revealed that the proposed k-means grouping technique reduce the energy consumption at centralized aggregator while satisfying the required completion time.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The current ripple in core of HVDC cable magnetically induces a voltage in the sheath, whereas the voltage ripple causes the flow of charging current from core to sheath. The knowledge of sheath voltage is necessary to ensure compliance with the specification of utility companies. In this work, we have reported that the models available in commercial Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation software erroneously introduce a DC bias in steady-state sheath voltage and sheath current. We have also demonstrated that by removing the DC bias accurate steady-state evaluation of sheath voltage and sheath current is possible. Additionally, we have analyzed the sheath voltage and currents in HVDC cable considering different cable lengths and sheath grounding schemes. It has been found that grounding the sheath at the terminal of HVDC cable can limit the sheath voltage to acceptable levels without causing substantial joule loss in the sheath.

Different species of aphids are the most destructive pests of these crops due to sucking of cell sap from leaves, stem, flowers and pods limiting the crop yields. A field experiment was conducted to determine the relative tolerance of 28 canola genotypes against aphids and the effect of different abiotic factors on the aphid incidence from late January to late March at fortnightly intervals. Data inferred that all the evaluated genotypes had varying degree of tolerance to aphids and none of them was found completely immune. The abundance of aphids on different sampling dates and seasonal means differed significantly among the tested genotypes. The lowest aphid population per plant was observed on genotype NR-18 (11.11), whereas the highest on genotype NR-11 (89.22). For grain yield, genotype NR-18 gave the maximum productivity (3028.57 kg/ha) and NR-11 yielded the least (1409.11 kg/ha). Furthermore, highest aphid population (95.60 per plant) was recorded during the mid of March. The abundance of aphids showed non-significant association with mean temperature, humidity and sunshine.

Moreover, the proposed HSD-CIB can overcome the demerit of the existing single-stage ac-dc buck PFC converter in terms of highvoltage/current switching stress, gate-driver complexity, low conversion gain and low efficiency. This paper presents the detailed design and analysis of the proposed HSD-CIB PFC converter for an LED lighting system. A closed loop voltage mode control (VMC) is designed and implemented to study the line regulations of HSD-CIB converter at various loading conditions. The analysis of the proposed HSD-CIB topology is carried out using Matlab/Simulink simulation and validated experimentally with a prototype of 16 W.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Most abundantly expressed transcripts of C. procera coded for expansins, aquaporins and sugar/salt transporters. Four homologs of expansin gene (CpEXPA1, CpEXPA2, CpEXPA3 and CpEXPA4) and four of aquaporins (CpTiP1, CpTiP2, CpPiP1 and CpPiP2) were found to be the most abundantly expressed transcripts in fast growing C. procera fiber cells. Cotton fiber EST\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s revealed two homologs of expansin, one for G. hirsutum plasma membrane intrinsic protein (GhPiP1) and one transcript for sucrose synthase. The GhPiP1 had 70% amino acid identity to CpPiP1, while no homolog was detected for CpPiP2 in cotton fibers. Real-time PCR data showed that CpPiP1 had about 40% higher transcript level of the gene in C. procera as compared to cotton. CpPiP2 showed high level of transcripts in C. procera fiber only. On the other hand, CpEXPA3 was the closest homologue of GhEXP15 (76% amino acid identity) and its transcript level was 80% higher in C. procera fibers.

This efficiency estimation method is performed in order to indicate that the financial factor is widely recognized and important as one of the significant parameter which shows the ranking of an NBA player that can be utilized by the decision maker or management. However, calculating this sort of model is complex because of plenty of individual player achievements and statistics that entail contemplation. The results of the current paper show that the ranking based on our proposed SBM approach totally differs from that based on the player impact estimate (PIE) measures.

There are a number of physical, chemical, and biological techniques applicable worldwide for wastewater treatment, but the phytoremediation techniques are the green, sustainable, and promising solutions to problem of environmental contamination. Studies revealed that there are certain hyper-accumulator genes present in plants, which make them more metal tolerant than non-hyper-accumulator plants species where those genes are absent. In addition, hyper-accumulator plants tackle with heavy metals by activating their responsive genes for chelation, trafficking, and sequestration.

The fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration was assessed by glucometer, while serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL were estimated by using standard kits. The FBG concentration significantly (p< 0.05) decreased in dose-dependent pattern in both alloxan-induced diabetic and fructose-fed rats on Hs. Cr administration. The percentage glucose reductions in alloxanized rats with glibenclamide, Hs. Cr 100, 300, and 500 mg/kg were obeserved to be 67, 36, 56 and 62%, respectively. In fructose-fed rats, the percentage glucose redutions associated with metformin, Hs. Cr 100, 300, and 500 mg/kg were 23, 5, 11 and 12%, respectively. The extract also corrected the dyslipidemia associated with fructose and alloxan-induced diabetes by significantly (p< 0.001) decreasing the concentration of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL and by increasing HDL concentration.

Organization cannot afford any kinds of attacks on their confidential information and resources either from insiders or out-siders. The damage done by insiders is more severe than that of external attackers due to their knowledge about the system and potential targets. It has been observed by studying previous case studies of insider attacks that insiders usually get involve in some unusual or suspicious activities prior to launching actual attacks. So observing these kinds of activities and taking proper actions in time may help to avoid such kinds of attacks. In this paper a risk assessment methodology has been presented to compute the threat levels of insiders.

{"title": "Tuberculosis deaths: are we measuring accurately?\n", "abstract": " Death among tuberculosis patients is one of the major reasons for non-attainment of 85% treatment success target set by World Health Organization. In this short paper, we evaluated whether the overall mortality rate in pulmonary tuberculosis is being affected by other comorbid conditions. All new smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients (N =336), who started their treatment at the chest clinic of the Penang General Hospital, between March 2010 and February 2011, were followed-up until December 2011. Tuberculosis treatment outcomes were reported according to six treatment outcome categories recommended by World Health Organization. The outcome category \u0393\u00c7\u00ffdied\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 was defined as \u0393\u00c7\u00ffa patient who died due to tuberculosis or other cause during tuberculosis treatment\u0393\u00c7\u00d6. Our findings showed that out of 336 smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients, 59 (17.6%) died during treatment (mortality rate = 1.003 cases per 1000 person-days of follow-up). Among the deceased patients, the mean age was 55.8 years (SD =16.17) and 49 were male. According to the mortality review forms, 29 deaths were tuberculosis-related, while the remaining 30 patients died due to reasons other than tuberculosis. Cerebrovascular accident (n =7), septicaemia shock (n =4) and acute coronary syndrome (n =4) were the most common non-tuberculosis related reasons for mortality in the patients. If the 30 patients, for whom tuberculosis was incidental to death, are excluded from the final cohort, the proportion of patients in the \u0393\u00c7\u00ffdied\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 outcome category could be reduced to 9.5%.

The cultivation of wheat started about 10,000 years ago as part of the Neolithic revolution which state a transition from hunting and gathering of food to settle agriculture. Earlier cultivated forms of wheat were diploid (einkorn) and tetraploid (emmer) with known initial origin of the south-eastern part of Turkey (Dubcovsky and Dvorak, 2007). Subsequent evolutionary adaptation and continuous research produced hexaploid bread wheat that is currently widely adapted in about 95% area of world wheat.

{"title": "Homeobox leucine zipper proteins and cotton improvement\n", "abstract": " Transcription factors play key roles in plant develop- ment and stress responses through their interaction with cis-elements and/or other transcription factors. Homeodomain associated leucine zipper proteins (HD-Zip) constitute a family of transcription factors that are characterized by the presence of a DNA- binding domain closely linked with leucine zipper motif functioning in dimer formation. This type of association is unique to plants and considered as an excellent candidate to activate developmental respons- es to altering environmental conditions. Cotton is the most important fiber plant with a lot of local and commercial uses in the world. HD-Zip proteins not only have key roles in different stages of vascular and inter-fascicular fiber differentiation of cotton but also are suggested to have an important role against abio- tic stress that is one of the key factors limiting cotton productivity. Plants have developed various strategies to manage stress conditions through a combination of metabolic, physiological and morphological adapta- tions. These adaptive changes rely largely on altera- tions in gene expression. Therefore, transcriptional regulators play a crucial role in stress tolerance. Be- ing a transcription factor HD-Zip might be a useful target for genetic engineering to generate multiple stress tolerance in susceptible plants. In the following chapter, we discussed how the HD-Zip proteins would play a useful role for cotton development both in fiber production and stress adaptation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["27"]}

In maize, successful applications have been exemplified by marker assisted introgression of novel genomic regions associated with anthesis-silking interval, marker-based diagnosis of plants containing the opaque2 gene associated with quality, and marker-based prediction of hybrid vigor.

Nutrient treatments included full fertilizer NP (100: 100: 00), full fertilizer NP+ FYM (100: 100: 20), half-fertilizer NP (50: 50: 00), half-fertilizer NP+ FYM (50: 50: 20), FYM only (00: 00: 20) and control (00: 00: 00). N & P were applied in kg ha-1 and FYM in t ha-1. Wheat variety, Chakwal-86 was planted in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. Because of different combinations of fertilizer NP and FYM, statistically significant differences in biological yield, grain yield and yield components of wheat were recorded. Maximum wheat grain yield of 4083 kg ha-1 was obtained with the application of full fertilizer and FYM. Minimum grain yield and biological yield were recorded with no fertilizer and only FYM application. Different combinations of fertilizer NP with and without FYM did not have any significant effect on quality parameters ie, test weight, PSI and percent flour yield.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["27"]}

In this paper we test the performance of two classes of anti-collision protocols that is collision detection (pure Aloha and slotted Aloha) and collision avoidance (non-persistent CSMA and slotted non-persistent ISMA). To evaluate the performance of these classes of protocols we implement a simulation environment in MATLAB where we model single reader and multiple tags which run these protocols. We evaluate these protocols on the basis of two parameters i.e. tag throughput and collision rate. We found that the collision detection protocols suffer heavily due to packet collisions and results in reduced tag identifications.

We argue that vigilante violence originates from fear, righteous anger, and retaliatory punitive desire that stems from violations of moral imperatives, which are Durkheimian sacred values. We argue that morally outraged people transform their fear and anger into violent action through mobilization and bodily alignment in vigilante rituals. These rituals can restore the integrity of moral imperatives and generate the unity of the in-group. Further, we propose the following variable socio-legal conditions that affect the likelihood for vigilante rituals to occur: legal legitimacy, an exposure to violence, and authorities\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 encouragement of (violent) self-help.

Motivation in L2 learning is a complex phenomenon that had gained the attention of researchers and theorists for many decades. Motivation to learn English as a second language have been described and categorized in several ways. However, the emerging trend of English language learning at a high rate calls forth to answer the question such as why learners are so ambitious to learn this language in the presence of a national language. Secondly, if they are learning the English language, what is the kind of motivation urging them to learn it. At the present scenario, the English language has become a compulsion in both academic and professional career of L2 learners; though, the L2 learners should be reinforced to speak in English inside and outside of the classroom. The hegemony of the English language cannot be refuted at any cost because it has been employed in the domains of power-administration, military, education, and commerce since the making of Pakistan.

Proposed OOC-based construction gives three classes of binary QC-LDPC codes with no length-4 cycles by utilizing some known ingredients including binary matrix dispersion of elements of finite field, incidence matrices, and circulant decomposition. Secondly, the proposed OOC-based construction gives an effective method to jointly design length-4 cycles free QC-LDPC codes for coded-relay cooperation, where sum-product algorithm- (SPA-) based joint-iterative decoding is used to decode the corrupted sequences coming from the source or relay nodes in different time frames over constituent Rayleigh fading channels.

The data were collected from 20 students from two universities, ie University of Management and Technology and Lahore Leads University. The quantitative methodology was used to analyze the data. The participants were asked to write a paragraph which was used as a tool of data collection in this research and to identify the classification of errors which students make in their writings. For this research, the researchers analyzed each questionnaire and marked the errors and then formed the tables for each category of error comprising of number of students made this error which was used for conclusion and leading to the root cause of errors made in their write-ups. During analysis of their write-ups, the study was able to point out different errors (11 categories), it was also found that the most common type of error which participants made during writing was punctuation. There was no major difference between error pattern of male & female students since frequency of errors made by them was just a slightly different. The study suggests recommendations for further improvements.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}
{"title": "Plant defense system activated in chili plants by using extracts from Eucalyptus citriodora\n", "abstract": " Biological control using plant extracts provides an effective fungal management program, and represents an alternative to reliance on fungicides (Bowers and Locke, 2004). It is often used to gradually suppress widespread infestations in low value or remote areas where other methods are not feasible. Studies on the mechanisms of disease control by plant extracts/products have revealed that the biologically active constituents present in them may have either direct antimicrobial activity (Ansari, 1995; Amadioha, 2000) or induce host plants defense response resulting in reduction of disease development (Schneider and Ullrich, 1994). Induced resistance is an important component of disease-resistance response of plants, and is accompanied by increased capability for activating defense responses upon pathogen ingress. In fact, the induction of resistance in plants involves the activation of defense latent mechanisms in response to the treatment with elicitor agents (plant secondary metabolites), protecting against the subsequent infection by pathogens (Kagale et al., 2004). There are many reports in the literature which demonstrate the concept of induced resistance in laboratory or glasshouse experiments, including biotic and abiotic elicitors, either in a pure form or as a crude mixture. The defense gene products include peroxidase (PO), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) that catalyze the formation of lignin and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) that is involved in phyto-alexins and phenolics synthesis. Other defense enzymes include pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) such as \u256c\u2593-1, 3-glucanases (PR-2 family) and chitinases (PR-3 family) which\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}

However, in term of genetics, milk quality can be linked with beta casein. Beta casein is a milk protein having genetic variants, one of which is believed to be linked with progression of many diseases including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases and nervous disorders. As beta casein has genetic basis so milk quality can be elucidated by animal genotyping. But no such genotyping facility was available country wide for this purpose. Hence objective of this study is the development of diagnostic test using ARMS-PCR technology in Pakistan and genotyping of beta casein variants in Pakistani population of Holstein Friesian cattle. A total of 166 blood samples were collected from Holstein Friesian (imported from Holland, USA and Australia) and genotyped using ARMS-PCR. Validation of ARMS-PCR was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of beta casein gene from 78 animals. ARMS-PCR based test was then compared with parallel genotyping techniques in term of cost and time effectivity. Reproducibility of this test was tested and validation of this test was done by Sanger sequencing. This test is cost effective as well as time effective in compared to other techniques. Holstein Friesian originating from different countries have different percentages of beta casein variants. This test can be used routinely for genotyping of beta casein. In future there is a need to find out prevalence of beta casein variants of indigenous cattle as well as cross bred population of Pakistan and formulation of breeding policy\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}

When enough water is available in the river then the power can be generated. In this research paper I discussed the maximum power extracted through run off river plant using doubly fed induction generator. Now a day for variable speed turbines doubly fed induction generator is the most suitable machine to extract electrical power from the energy source. In this research paper I proposed a study of variable speed turbine on a run off river plant using doubly fed induction generator. Usually electrical power is extracted from variable speed small hydro turbine through synchronous or induction generator but in both cases voltage magnitude and frequency change with changing of discharge. In proposed research paper I stabilize frequency and magnitude of voltage by doubly fed induction generator. The entire model has been verified by simulation using MATLAB/simulation environment under the various situation, such as discharge values and different reference reactive power on rotor side converter and also on different reference reactive power on grid side converter. From the simulation results and investigation we can say that p doubly fed induction generator model can extract maximum power from run off river without affecting the voltage magnitude and frequency and reactive power control between grid and DFIG.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "Evaluation of Electric Field and Space Charge Dynamics in Dielectric under DC Voltage with Superimposed Switching Impulse\n", "abstract": " The influx of a switching impulse during DC steady-state operations causes severe electrical stress on the insulation of HVDC cables. Thus, the insulation should be designed to withstand a superimposed switching impulse. All major manufacturers of DC cables perform superimposed switching impulse breakdown tests for prequalification. However, an experimental approach to study space charge dynamics in dielectrics under a switching impulse superposed on DC voltage has not been reported yet. This is because, unlike the DC stress, it is not possible to study the charge dynamics experimentally under complex stresses, such as switching impulse superposition. Hence, in order to predict and investigate the breakdown characteristics, it is necessary to obtain accurate electric field distribution considering space charge dynamics using a numerical approach. Therefore, in this paper, a numerical study on the switching impulse superposition was carried out. The space charge dynamics and its distribution within the dielectric under DC stress were compared with those under a superimposed switching impulse using a bipolar charge transport (BCT) model. In addition, we estimated the effect of a superimposed switching impulse on a DC electric field distribution. It was concluded that the temperature conditions of dielectrics have a significant influence on electric field and space charge dynamics. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}

In cut flowers, persistent and prolonged display life is the matter of concern which decides quality index for florists and consumers. Endophytic bacteria, taken up by the plants when colonized, can act as sink for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), hence delay senescence. These bacteria, when used as suspension solution for cut flowers, increase the vase life manifolds which signify their application to commercial floriculture. Keeping in view, the exalted status and market value of cut tulips, an experiment was conducted to study the response of four bacterial strains viz. Burkholderia phytofirmans (PsJN), Caulobacter sp.(FA-13), Enterobacter sp.(MN-17) and Bacillus sp.(MN-54) along with control treatment (nontreated stems) in concentrated and diluted forms to estimate the postharvest longevity. 15 mL of suspension solution of bacterial culture was sprayed on each observational unit under controlled conditions in laboratory. In this experiment,(PsJN) in concentrated form, performed best and resulted in the longest vase life (11.2 d), delayed leaf yellowing (8.8 d), more water uptake (70.33 mL), less stem elongation (5.14 cm), more days to open flower bud (2.47 d), maximum flower diameter (50.79 mm) and. Whereas (MN-17) in concentrated form performed best in fresh and dry mass ratio and reduced stem bending.

Patients\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 refractive status were evaluated by performing cycloplegic refraction, followed by appropriate management plan. The refractive errors of both eyes were noted and compared for any significant anisometropia.Results: One hundred and seventeen (n= 117) children with median age (IQR) of 32 (12) months having bilateral CNLDO were enrolled. Children with bilateral CNLDO had insignificant interocular difference in terms of spherical equivalent (SE) and cylindrical refractive errors (p> 0.05). The rate of the anisometropia (> 1 D difference between the two eyes) was 5.98%(n= 7) in children with bilateral CNLDO.Conclusion: Performing cycloplegic refraction routinely in patients with bilateral CNLDO is not as urgent as compared to ones with unilateral CNLDO. Further, avoidance of early surgical intervention in children with bilateral CNLDO will spare the parents from the emotional trauma and positively influence the health economics worldwide.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}
{"title": "Zika Virus: A critical analysis and pharmaceutical perspectives\n", "abstract": " Zika virus belongs to family of viruses' Flaviviridae'and spreads mostly by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes. The resulting infection is known as Zika fever. It is usually asymptomatic or often causes mild symptoms, which are very similar to dengue fever. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is also responsible for dengue and chikungunya viruses. Zika virus can spread by crossing the placental barrier from a pregnant mother to a fetus, which can result in microcephaly, severe brain malformations including Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and other birth defects. Until now, there is no specific treatment of Zika fever disease, and Zika virus illness cannot be prevented by medications or vaccines. According to WHO, no vaccine is likely to be available until 2020. The only way of preventing this disease is to prevent the mosquito bites.

Fast-growing species which thrive in otherwise non-arable problematic soil and which hold the added advantage of improving the condition of the soil, can be used to increase production area, and, thus, are highly desired. We investigated the growth performance and lignin content under normal and stressed conditions for these Acacia mangium Willd. and Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. Normal growing conditions was represented by fertile soil, high water-holding capacity due to low soil drainage, high organic matter, low soil temperature, overall consistent rainfall and relatively milder temperatures, whilst stressed conditions were achieved with a sandy soil with low fertility, low waterholding capacity due to high drainage and low organic matter, and high soil temperature accompanied by inconsistent monthly temperature and rainfall. Growth performance under normal conditions was significantly better compared to the stressed conditions. A. mangium performed better than A. auriculiformis under the normal conditions. However A. auriculiformis performed better under stressed conditions due to better adaptability. The lignin content under normal conditions fluctuated from one DBH class to another. As for the stress conditions, A. mangium exhibited incremental increases in lignin content with increasing biomass. In contrast, lignin content in A. auriculiformis decreased with increasing biomass.

Thus, new anti-cancer drugs derived from natural products are expected to play an important role in the development of more effective and safer strategies to inhibit the progress of cancer, without inducing cell lethality in the healthy surrounding tissues. Crinum asiaticum is used traditionally to treat inflammations and tumours. The aim of this work is to ascertain the scientific viability of its use in traditional medicine as an anti-tumour (potential anti-cancer) agent. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, it is hypothesised that the anti-tumour activity may be due to anti-angiogenic activity. Thus, in the present study, an attempt has been made to study the anti-angiogenic activity of the Crinum asiaticum leaf methanol extract (CALME) of the Malaysian species. Rat aortic ring assay results showed that CALME prevented new blood vessel formation from the aortic ring explants, with IC50 11.58 \u252c\u2561g/ml.

Currently growers, retailers and consumers hold their cut tuberose spikes in tap water. However, presence of salts in tap water poses threat to cut spikes and may shorten their postharvest longevity. Therefore, a study was conducted to evaluate the effect of water collected from various sources on postharvest longevity and keeping quality of cut tuberose spikes. The results demonstrated that spikes kept in carbonated plus distilled water (1: 1) had longest vase life, with highest water uptake, and relative fresh weight. Moreover, it delayed floret opening time, increased open florets percentage and produced superior quality spikes as compared to other water sources. Spikes kept in distilled, deionized and reverse osmosis water also extended postharvest longevity of cut tuberose spikes. On the other hand, canal water or tap water available in local markets found unfit for handling cut tuberose spikes as these reduced vase life. Therefore, it is recommended that carbonated plus distilled water (1: 1), distilled, deionized or reverse osmosis water should be used by the stakeholders instead of tap or canal water for extending vase life and maintaining quality of cut tuberose spikes.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "A novel trignometric energy functional for image segmentation in the presence of intensity in-homogeneity\n", "abstract": " A novel region based Active Contour Model (ACM) for image segmentation is presented using image local information for intensity inhomogeneity images. A transcendental (trigonometric) energy functional based on Local Fitted Image (LFI) energy is suggested to extract the image local information. The difference between the original and fitting image is introduced as an angular constraint of the trigonometric function. This new approach has the ability to handle images with severe intensity inhomogeneity, multiple intensity classes and regions with non-homogeneous pixel intensities. To regularize and maintain the level set function, Gaussian filtering procedure is adopted that not only maintains the level set consistency but also eliminates re-initialization procedure to avoid computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed model holds boundary regularization property and achieves sub-pixel accuracy\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Most of the pigeon breeds are reared exclusively because of their physical characteristic, soaring capabilities and for their racing-sports. Pakistan has distinctive domestic pigeon breeds which have been bred for centuries. Sherazi is a unique Pakistani domestic pigeon which is also named as Lahori in Pakistan and its relatives are known as Shirazi in Iran, Saksarli in Turkey and Shaik in Lebnan (http://www. avianweb. com/shakhsharlitumblers. html; 02-02-2013). The markings on the Sherazi pigeon make it a unique breed. The Sherazi is semi-solid in color from the bottom of the chest going up and around the neck in a smooth pattern. There are clearly identifiable color-patches on cheeks and skull. The color of the patches is same as the body color. All the patches are desired characteristics of the breed. No white feathers are to be present in the vent area. The Sherazi pigeon is considered as a good flyer (http://wwingsaviary. lbbhost. com/PigeonPages/Shakhsharli. html; 02-02-2013). Taxonomic characterization of pigeons always remains a challenge for taxonomists, which raises the question about the ancestry of domestic pigeon breeds and their lineage diversity.

This gives an individual control on this cylinder, improving the fuel consumption in relation of the Single point injection. In The first Multipoint injection system, the injection was done at the same time in all injectors. The improvement in relation of the single point is the same amount of Fuel is delivering to all cylinders. This system only solved one problem, because the problem of lag was still existent, like in the single point injection. So if the injection occur, the fuel and air are in the admission valve, and if driver make a sudden change it only change the fuel in the next admission, so it would be a waste of fuel or insufficient fuel. To solve this problem it was develop one new system of Multipoint Injection. This system is sequential Multipoint injection system; the layout is the same that the original Multipoint injection system, the difference is that the injection is done individually, in each cylinder. In this system because we have injection individually and sequential, we don\u0393\u00c7\u00d6t have the lag problem.

{"title": "Performance analysis of EC-EARTH 3.1\n", "abstract": " The EC-EARTH model is a global, coupled climate model that consists of the separate components IFS for the atmosphere and NEMO for the ocean that are coupled using the OASIS coupler. EC-EARTH was ported and run on the Curie system. Different configurations, using resolutions from T159 (approx. 128km) to T799 (approx 25km), were available for benchmarking. Scalasca was used to analyze the performance of the model in detail. Although it was expected that either the I/O or the coupling would be a bottleneck for scaling of the highest resolution model, that is clearly not, yet, the case. The IFS model uses two MPI_Alltoallv calls per timestep that dominate the loss of scaling at 1024 cores. Using the OpenMP functionality in IFS could potentially increase scalability considerably, but this does not yet work on Curie. Work is ongoing to make MPI_Alltoallv more efficient on Curie. It is expected that I/O and/or coupling does become a bottleneck when IFS can be scaled further than 2000 cores. Therefore, the OASIS team increased the scalability of OASIS dramatically with the implementation of a radically different approach, showing less than 1% overhead at 2000 cores. The scalability of NEMO was improved during an earlier PRACE project. The I/O subsystem in IFS is described and is probably not easily accelerated unless it is being rewritten and uses a different file format.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Moreover, many surveys on metals analysis reported that the iron, zinc, sodium, potassium calcium, magnesium and manganese are most abundant elements for human biological system and they are greatly required to human body in sufficient amount for better growth and development of different organs. The amount of these metals can be varying in human body through intake of diet and different environmental factors. Even though, many metals are essential for human body but Iron and manganese, are most essential trace metals that are needed by human, for keeping their good physiology and different structures to grow. There might be a chance of iron and manganese deficiency and toxicity as their concentrations in human body increased from certain normal levels like 0.4-1.2 mg/l and 0.9-1.1 mg/l for iron and manganese respectively.

In seedling stage, level of non-hypersensitive resistance or partial resistance was assessed from latency period (LP), infection frequency (IF), percentage of early aborted infection units without plant cell necrosis (EA-N%) and colony diameter of infection units of single-pustule isolates of Puccinia triticina INRA on 12 spring wheat cultivars/lines. In adult plant stage, non-hypersensitive resistance was evaluated from LP and IF of single-pustule isolate of P. triticina on 8 spring wheat cultivars and 4 lines, while in a field experimental area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated to assess the level of non-hypersensitive resistance in 8 spring wheat cultivars and two lines. In both seedling and adult plant stage, host genotypes varied for all the parameters studied, indicating a variety of genes with minor effect for non-hypersensitive resistance, since non-hypersensitive resistance is considered to be quantitatively inherited. In partially resistant genotypes the fungus showed a longer LP, lower IF, an increase in EA-N% and reduced colony diameter than on highly susceptible genotypes. Differences between genotypes for the level of nonhypersensitive resistance were larger in adult plant stage than in seedling stage.

{"title": "Licence Plate Identification and Recognition for Non-Helmeted Motorcyclists using Light-weight Convolution Neural Network\n", "abstract": " Motorcycle accidents have been rapidly increasing in many countries. The helmet is the main safety equipment of motorcyclists, but many drivers do not use it. Helmets are essential for the safety of a motorcycle rider. Hence, detecting and extracting licence plate of the motorcycle in which riders have not wear helmet becomes a crucial task. Many methods have been proposed to detect and extract the licence plate; however, due to poor video quality and non-uniform illumination, licence plate detection becomes a difficult task. Recently, due to the advancement in graphical processing units (GPUs) and larger datasets, deep learning based models have obtained remarkable performance in the object detection task. One such model is single shot detection (SSD) which classify and detect real-time objects precisely. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for detecting and extracting a licence plate of the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Pupal parasitoid, Dirhinus giffardii is one of the most significant biological control agents that has been used effectively in controlling the fruit flies. Laboratory studies were conducted to investigate the parasitism, emergence and post emergence sex ratio of D. giffardii through different exposure times and parasitoid density against the pupae of melon fruit fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae. The studies manifested that the exposure time and parasitoid density had a significant effect on the parasitism and emergence ratio of parasitoids. Results revealed that mean rate of parasitism (45.66) was the highest in case of five pair of parasitoids and mean rate of emergence (42.66) of D. giffardii was also the highest on exposure period of six days. Further, it was observed that, exposure time and parasitoid density had no significant effect on the post emergence sex ratio of male and female parasitoids. The mean per female parasitism was increasing with the increase in number of pairs of D. giffardii and reached to its peak after exposure time of six days.

Various attempts at increasing efficiency of extraction by phytoremediation include adding micro-organisms, co-cropping various species and using genetically engineered species. So far, the effect of levels of concentration of heavy metals on extraction efficiency of these plants has not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to test for the hypothesis that the concentration of heavy metals in soils affects the efficiency of phytoremediation. Nine samples of Typha latifolia were planted under controlled environment. Plants were irrigated by wastewater of industrial effluents diluted with different amounts of clean water, while providing protection from rainwater. The soil in the planters was tested for heavy metals to obtain levels of contamination already present in the soil and after plants was fully grown, using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry, while the wastewater used for irrigation was tested using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The amount of heavy metals already present in the soil and that introduced by irrigation was compared to the amount left behind in the soil after maturity of plants, were compared to test the hypothesis. The results suggested that rate of extraction of heavy metals using phytoremediation was indeed affected by the level of concentration of heavy metals in the soil and irrigation water, however, owing to the small number of samples, the relationship between\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

However, the huge amount of data combined with the high computational complexity of HEVC, poses limitations on high-speed light field capturing and storage. This paper presents a contribution for low complexity encoding of light fields, in different formats using HEVC, based on a Random Forests ensemble classifier. Optimal features for training the classifier are found through a score fusion based approach. Using the HEVC still image profile, the proposed method gives speed-up of 56.23% for sub-aperture images. For pseudo video format, the proposed method outperforms others available in the literature, yielding an average speed-up of 62.18%, 56.54% and 44.73% for Random Access, Low-delay Main and All-Intra profiles respectively, with negligible decrease in RD performance\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Water balance is probably the most important and least understood mechanism with the glass ionomer cement. Excessive water in glass ionomer produce weak cement while less amount of water produce cement which is relatively stronger initially but later results in the weakening of the cement. Water present in glass ionomer cement is classified according to its nature of being held in to the cement as tightly bound and loosely bound. The amount of loosely bound water loss from various composition of glass ionomer cement remains unknown. Methods: The study was conducted at the Department of Materials, Queen Mary University of London. Two different composition of glass ionomer cements were used in this experiment in which the amount of water absorbed by the different compositions of cement on 1, 3, 7 and 14 days were evaluated and the loss of water was measured after that period until the loss became constant. A total of 25 samples of each GIC composition, 5 samples were immersed in water for 24 hours, 5 in water for 3 days, 5 for 7 days and 5 for 14 days. The remaining 5 samples were directly placed into the desiccator without immersing it in the water. The total water content of both glass ionomer cements was calculated from its chemical composition.

{"title": "Is normal blood glucose level influenced by watching horror movies\n", "abstract": " The aspiration of this project was to assess either interactions between the blood glucose level and watching horror movies. Over-all 120 subjects were the participants of this study. Blood glucose level is the volume of glucose present in the blood. It is computed in the units of millimoles per liter. Its normal level remains between 4 and 8mmol/lit. It is the large unit of measurement and mainly measured in units of mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter). The normal blood glucose is from 70 to 130 mg/dl in case of no eating. It escalates after taking meal (> 140 mg/dl) and declines after 4-5 hours of previous food bite. Carbohydrates are the chief source of liveliness for our body. They are converted to form glucose mostly. It stays normal if we will take the diet habitually. It is very important to watch BGL during diabetes, pregnancy, pancreatitis and in case of increasing age. The amount of sugar in blood, above from normal range proposes a disturbance in glucose homeostasis. A constant raised level is considered as hyperglycemia and minimal level is stated for hypoglycemia. We, most of us, think that horror movies are harmful for health but that is not same for all situations. No doubt, it elates anxiety and heart rate but it also burns calories of fatty persons significantly. The extra stored calories burning benefits you making smarter and healthier. Viewing a horror movie for 1.5 hours triggers your adrenaline pump and it exhausts close to 113 calories certainly. It is similar to walking for half an hour.

Conventionally Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) based staining is used to microscopically screen sputum from the presumptive Tuberculosis Cases. However, Fluorescent microscopy (FM) is now gradually replacing the conventional ZN microscopy because of its higher efficiency and efficacy in detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In patients, who do not produce sufficiently high number of bacilli, and are known as Smear-negative, efficacy of both types of microscopy remains questionable as no Mycobacteria are detected in the sputum of these patients and they are falsely labelled as smear-negative.OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study was conducted on the patient samples received from different parts of Sindh to study the proportions of false-negative tuberculosis using fluorescent microscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2014 to June 2016 at the Tuberculosis Laboratories of Dow University of Health Sciences. Data analyzed for 1439 samples received during 24-month period, which had subsequently been confirmed by culture. All laboratory work was performed as per guidelines of the National Program.

{"title": "A first step towards reducing insider threats in government organizations\n", "abstract": " The problem of insider threats is one of the most challenging to the organizations and research community since a long time. It is well proved that the damage done by insiders is more severe than that of external attackers. In government organizations, most of the users are not aware of the advanced security measures so are more vulnerable to such kind of attacks. As observed by reviewing many case studies of insider attacks, it is clear that insiders normally perform some unusual or suspicious activities before launching actual attacks. So monitoring these activities and taking proper actions in time is helpful to avoid such kinds of attacks. In this paper a risk assessment methodology is presented to compute the threat levels of users in lesser IT literate environment. This methodology is an extension to our previous work [1]. The difference is that in previous work the approach was for pure IT related business\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "A Novel Approach for Blind Estimation of Reverberation Time using Gamma Distribution Model\n", "abstract": " In this paper we proposed an unsupervised algorithm to estimate the reverberation time (RT) directly from the reverberant speech signal. For estimation process we use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which is a very well-known and state of the art method for estimation in the field of signal processing. All existing RT estimation methods are based on the decay rate distribution. The decay rate can be obtained either from the energy envelop decay curve analysis of noise source when it is switch off or from decay curve of impulse response of an enclosure. The analysis of a pre-existing method of reverberation time estimation is the foundation of the proposed method. In one of the state of the art method, the reverberation decay is modeled as a Laplacian distribution. In this paper, the proposed method models the reverberation decay as a Gamma distribution along with the unification of an effective technique for spotting free decay in reverberant speech. Maximum likelihood estimation technique is then used to estimate the RT from the free decays. The method was motivated by our observation that the RT of a reverberant signal when falls in specific range, then the decay rate of the signal follows Gamma distribution. Experiments are carried out on different reverberant speech signal to measure the accuracy of the suggested method. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method performs better and the accuracy is high in comparison to the state of the art method.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The flow is considered to be laminar and hydrodynamically as well as thermally developed, whereas the thermal boundary condition of constant heat flux per unit axial length with constant peripheral temperature at any cross section, is assumed. The governing equations are solved using the spectral method and the finite difference method. Excellent comparison is noted in the numerical results given by the two methods but the spectral method is found to be superior in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. We have noted that the flow reversal due to high Raleigh number may be controlled by applying an external magnetic field of suitable strength.

In this type of situations some kind of routing protocols are needed for these mobile nodes to fully operate and function properly. Ad-hoc network has some common features, which need some routing protocol. The most significant one is the dynamic routing protocols, which quickly change the topology. Reactive routing protocols search a route to destination/remote device on needed basis. Proactive protocols maintain the whole routing table at each node.

Approximately 20 species of Staphylococci have been isolated till present and only S. aureus is of major veterinary importance. It is an important opportunistic pathogen that can cause superficial to life threatening diseases in a variety of animal species including poultry. The most common form of infection in poultry involves tenosynovitis and arthritis (Hill et al., 1989; Glisson and Smith, 1990). The most obvious route of infection is through a break in the skin; through the respiratory tract and the gut (Eric and Carolyn 2001). Poultry, meat and egg products are the common sources of S. aureus, posing a potential health risk. It is the predominant bacteria involved in food poisoning and is a leading cause of gastroenteritis resulting from ingestion of enterotoxins preformed in contaminated food (Ves et al., 2003).Accurate and rapid identification of clinically important pathogens has been a challenge for microbiology laboratories.

The pre-sowing soil water (mm) in this study varied from 40 to 50 mm in loam and sandy clay soil of Islamabad and Chakwal, respectively. When soil water is> 50 mm, its effect on crop establishment is dependent on amount and temporal distribution of rainfall. Plant available soil water seems to be the most important factor if rainfall occurs between sowing and floral initiation period as happened during 2008-09 in the present study. The dynamics of soil water from emergence to maturity represented here as total soil water that remained maximum at earlier plant stages especially when crop roots were established and utilized soil water effectively that resulted in the lowest level of water at maturity which can be due to the evapotranspiration. The results depicted that the soil water distribution pattern mainly depends on soil properties and if sowing methodologies are resilient with available soil water then crop stand will be good and crop uses water much effectively. The results also depicted that when soil water is at drain upper limit (DUL) and the crop sown at proper time along with least soil evaporation, the soil water can be more easily taken up by the plant roots.

Voltage sag can cause miss-operation to several sensitive electronic equipments. This problem can be mitigated with pre-sag voltage injection method using custom power device, Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR). In this paper, emergency control in distribution systems is discussed by a flux-charge-model feedback algorithm using Fuzzy Logic Controller in order to improve the transient response and eliminate the steady-state error in DVR response, respectively. A flux-charge-model feedback algorithm is implemented so that the DVR would act as a large virtual inductance in series with the distribution feeder in fault situations. Controlling the DVR as a virtual inductor would also ensure zero real power absorption during the DVR compensation and thus minimize the stress in the DC link. The proposed system is applied to some disturbances in load voltage caused by induction motors starting, and a three-phase short circuit fault. Simulation results show the capability of the DVR to control the emergency conditions of the distribution systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "Techniques for hosting mobile web services on resource constrained devices\n", "abstract": " This thesis concerns hosting web services (WSs) on mobile devices. A number of challenges need to be addressed for hosting web services on such resource constrained devices. These include handling the diversity in the hardware configurations and operating systems for these devices, the execution of resource demanding web service applications and complex WS standards. A multi-dimensional approach has been proposed in this dissertation to address these challenges. A web service execution environment (WSEE) that uses lightweight components is devised for hosting web services on mobile devices. The hosted web services can be accessed by multiple WS clients and can support a basic set of WS standards such as SOAP and XML Signature. To support more computationally complex and resource demanding WS standards such as the standards for security and transaction management, a partitioned WSEE is proposed. Design time and runtime WS partitioning techniques are proposed to handle complex and resource demanding WS applications. The design time techniques use two graph-based algorithms for WS partitioning: Maximum Offloading Minimum Cost (MOMC) and Cluster based Application Partitioning (CAP). For the runtime WS partitioning technique, multiple execution plans, each of which corresponds to a specific partitioning of the system are determined first and then an appropriate execution plan is selected at runtime by using information on the current system load. The effectiveness of these proposed techniques is investigated through a system prototype (using sample web services) as well as simulation (using\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

{"title": "Student Centric Mobile Services: Design, Implementation and Evaluation\n", "abstract": " This project is a continuation of research work done by (Asif, 2009) which proposed an extended architecture of Mobile Student Information System (MSIS) to integrate the systems available for the students to provide student centric services on mobile devices. The architecture was developed by using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to provide services for collaboration and communication among the students or between students and the teachers. The mobile services are built by integrating MSIS to Twitter, Feed based systems and NTNU email system. The services have the potential to provide students an experience of a virtual environment of class, project work and discussion groups anytime-anywhere. The project has been carried out in accordance with design-science research model over a number of implementation and evaluation iterations.  A user-driven evaluation of the MSIS service has been conducted among a diverse group of NTNU students. The utility as well as the usability of the system were evaluated by applying observational and empirical evaluation methods in a real-world environment at the university. The usability test identified few issues with the initial design of services, and received feedback for enhancements. The Mobile Service Acceptance Model (MSAM) has been used to examine the factors that are influential for user adoption of mobile services in the light of this project. The MSAM instrument measures different facets of a mobile information service, such as the perceived usefulness, ease of use, and usage intention. Our findings confirm that the utility of the student centric mobile services are perceived as high\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

We evaluate the algorithms in an environment where users are not sure of collision, because other users may transmit (access the channel at same time). We found that the best known method for packet access communication, ALOHA, suffers heavily due to collision among packets. Further, CSMA protocols offer higher capacity but their performance is degraded by hidden terminals. Whereas ISMA, in which receiver controls the flow of packets from the tags, reduces these two problems of collision among data packets and hidden tags behind obstacles.

These factors include the laser pulse rate, laser energy per pulse, UV exposure time, methods of coating removal and environmental degradation (moisture). The variation in strength with respect to these factors is discussed in detail. However, it is observed in all the investigations that the average strength of all the fiber grating samples decreased.

Out of these, four genotypes; FH-883, FH-631S, CIM-707 (Gossypium hirsutum L., an allotetraploid species) and Ravi (G. arboreum, a diploid species) contrasting for lint quality traits were selected. The genotypes, CIM-707 (fibre length above 30 mm) and Ravi (fibre length 17 mm) were irradiated with gamma rays (125, 150, 200, 250 and 300 Gy), and were also treated with EMS (1, 1.5 and 2%). Both mutagens adversely affected the germination percentage of cotton seed. EMS-treated M1 population was much better than irradiated M1 population with respect to germination and plant growth. Moreover, ploidy level also affected the germination percentage. Staple length of M2 plants derived from the Ravi variety was in the range of 13-17.5 mm, while of M2 plants derived from CIM-707 was in the range of 22-31 mm. EMS and gamma irradiation can successfully be used for creating variation among cotton germplasm and hence mutation is a valuable tool for fibre quality improvement. After surveying 520 RAPDs and 435 SSRs, a genetic linkage map was constructed using 117 F2: 3 lines derived from a cross FH-631S x FH-883. Twenty loci were mapped into four linkage groups (LG) spanning around 230.2 cM with 5% of the cotton genome coverage. The average genetic distance was 11.5 cM between two adjacent loci.

Secondly, in most of the systems, frame size for data reception and transmission varies with the application, but the interrupt can be programmed for fixed frame sizes of 8, 16 and 32 words only. The achievement to be presented is the design of a high speed ARINC 429 module along with a UART, having a high speed processor interface with read and write cycles much shorter than the existing modules resulting in an improved performance of the system. Secondly, for varying frame sizes, system\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s interrupt can be programmed to interrupt the processor after receiving full frame which further enhances the performance. Furthermore, the ARINC transceiver is customized for point to point communication that reduced the complexity of design and hence made it more easy to use. While on the other side the UART offers a wide range of baud rates covering all the standard ones with programmable interrupt according to the receive frame size, from one byte to maximum of receive FIFO. This design is tested up to the clock speed of 24MHz with 16 bytes of transmit and receive FIFO. The hardware testing is performed by interfacing it with DSP TMS320C32.

{"title": "Impact of mulching materials on weeds dynamics, soil biological properties and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) productivity\n", "abstract": " Chemical control of weeds in lettuce crop brings damaging effects on soil microorganisms and reduces produce quality. It is therefore essential to explore effective and safe weed management approaches. Hence, a repeated field experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of black plastic mulch, wheat straw, rice husk, saw dust and manual weeding on weeds, soil health and lettuce yield. The minimum inhibitory effect on fresh and dry weight (gm-2) of weeds was recorded by rice husk whereas highest was noted by the application of wheat straw. However, expensive hand weeding was found to be superior in managing weed infestation. Maximum lettuce plant height, number of leaves plant-1, head diameter, fresh weight, dry weight and yield was obtained from manually weeded and wheat straw mulch treated plots. The application of wheat straw as mulch caused an increase of 1.59%, 12.35%, 14.02%, 4.13%, 7.56%, 6.39%, 14.33% and 18.6% in net return, soil dehydrogenase activity, \u256c\u2593-glucosidase activity, urease activity, microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and bacterial population, respectively over control. It is suggested that wheat straw mulch could be used to get better economic return, improve lettuce yield, inhibit weed growth and enhance soil biological functioning.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}
{"title": "Impact of Organizational Innovation and Organizational Politics on Organizational Performance: Job Satisfaction as Mediator\n", "abstract": " Current study investigates the impact of organizational politics (OPL) and organizational innovation (OI) on organizational performance. Moreover, this study examines how job satisfaction mediates the impact of OI and OPL on organizational performance. This study employs convenience sampling for selecting a sample of 315 employees from beverage based companies. In order to test model fitness and hypotheses, current study uses a confirmatory factor analysis and causal step approach. Results reveal a positive impact of OI on job satisfaction and organizational performance, but OPL was found to have no such impact. Further, OPL has a negative impact on OI. Lastly, job satisfaction only mediates the impact of OI on organizational performance. Previous research has rarely investigated OPL and innovation in a single study and there appears a lack of understanding of mechanism through which these constructs influence organizational performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}
{"title": "A Low Power, Highly Synchronized 2-Wire Serial Interface in 0.18 \u252c\u2561m CMOS Process\n", "abstract": " A low power, 2-wire serial interface is proposed in this paper for ADC applications. The serializer (SER) encapsulates ADC\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s parallel data into a specific frame and sends it serially to deserializer (DSER). The DSER synchronizes each incoming serial frame to give parallel data which is also synchronized with ADC. The design is fully synthesizable and is very effective for reducing the required pin count and only two pins are needed. The proposed design is an integral part in a sensor analog front end (AFE) and it is fabricated by using 1P6M 0.18 \u252c\u2561m CMOS process. The serial interface consumes a very low 183 \u252c\u2561W power, needs 102 \u252c\u2561A current with 1.8 V supply, takes 6648 \u252c\u2561m2 chip area and needs 757 gates for implementation. The simulation and experimental results reveal the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed ultra-low power serial design.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

The present studyobserves the Saraiki folktales which are the Oral traditions of Saraiki areas. The people of the Saraiki community followoral tradition for entertainment for their children and they also construct gender through them. The present study attempts to uncover how gender is constructed by examining oral tradition of Saraiki people ie folktales. The present study is also ethnographic in nature. The present study considers the gender construction theories ie feminist theory and discourse analysis theory. It was found that the story-telling tradition is loaded with the structures that exhibit and implicate male dominance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}

Liver cell harm resulting from various toxic chemical compounds (along with anti-biotic, chemotherapeutic retailers, thioacetamide and paracetamol and so forth.), excessive alcohol intake and microbes are nicely studied. A number of natural tablets show promising hepatoprotective activities in acute and chronic liver damage. In medication the natural products play an essential role because of their protection, efficacy and price effectiveness.

{"title": "Molecular detection of HCV infection in suspected liver disease patients of District Mardan, Khyber PuhktoonKhwa\n", "abstract": " Chronic hepatitis is a common cause of liver related problem due to different viruses concerned with liver, where Hepatitis C (HCV) has been documented as the major cause and lead to many complications. A total of 1500 (54% Male and 46% Female) suspected liver disease patients were selected for the study. Confirmation was carried out by ICT, ELISA and q-PCR. Age wise and gender wise and Tehsil wise distribution of the data was carried by statistical analysis. HCV RNA was detected in 438 (29.2%) samples out of total 1500 samples of suspected liver disease patients via q-PCR. Out of 438 patients, 210 (47.94%) were male and 228 (52.06%) were female patients. In age group 41-60 years there were 210 (47.94%) HCV RNA positive patients. In age group 21-40 years it was 104 (23.74%), in> 60 years it was 95 (21.68%) and in< 20 years 29 (6.62%) was observed. In Tehsil wise distribution it was noted that 228 (52.05%) HCV RNA positive samples were from Tehsil Mardan and 115 (26.25%) and 95 (21.68%) from Takhtbhai and Kattlang respectively. This study concludes that the most specific, sensitive and reliable test use for detection of HCV is q-PCR. Female infectivity rate with HCV is relatively higher then male in District Mardan. Age group 41-60 years was found the most susceptible group to HCV infection in this study. Among the three Tehsil of District Mardan, the highest number of HCV infected patients was found in Tehsil Mardan with 228 (52.05%) patients.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}
{"title": "A Case Study of Clustering the Source Code\n", "abstract": " The software systems are developed using the multi-languages with different dialects and scripts. When the changes are performed, the source code drifts away from the existing available system documentation (specifications, design, manuals), which represent the functionality of the software systems. The systems are required to understand and present at higher levels of abstractions to perform the changes and meet the current requirements. The source code clustering is used for the purpose of recovering the artifacts, understanding the system and identifying the relationships among the source code to plan, design and execute the changes in the software systems. This paper presents a clustering approach using the available source code, documentation, experience and knowledge about the domain and application to cluster the source code.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["27"]}
