{"title": "Reuse readiness levels as a measure of software reusability\n", "abstract": " The reuse of software and related artifacts offers the potential for cost savings in various industries and has contributed to the development of the cyberinfrastructure that is used by the Earth science community. Developing measures that enable the assessment of software in terms of its potential reusability can contribute to efforts of both developers and reusers of software. Draft Reuse Readiness Levels (RRLs) have been developed as an instrument for assessing the maturity of software products for potential reuse. The process employed to develop the draft RRLs is described, and the initial summary of topic areas defined for each level is presented. Based on recommendations from the community of Earth science data systems software developers, areas for improving the precision of the draft RRLs have been identified and an approach for identifying enhancements is described.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2216"]}

The primary objective of the mission was to apply and appropriately tailor GSFC knowledge and capability to design and build a CubeSat that increased resiliency and capability, while containing costs. The Dellingr spacecraft is a mixture of COTS and in-house components and includes two science instruments\u2013an advanced gated time-of-flight ion-neutral mass spectrometer (INMS) and a boom mounted fluxgate. While a traditional GSFC spacecraft approach includes detailed analysis, design, testing, and extensive reviews, the Dellingr team adopted a \u201cbuild, test, fix\u201d approach to identify and correct potential mission ending issues. Yet, despite extensive testing, Dellingr immediately experienced unexpected major anomalies once on orbit. Using a flatsat and the insight gained from extensive on-orbit engineering data, the team was able to alleviate some of these anomalies and recover some of the lost functionality. The extensive set of lessons-learned is driving changes to our systems architecture, flight software, and testing approaches, and has provided valuable insight into what is required to produce a NASA CubeSat science mission with a moderate assurance of mission success, while containing resource requirements.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2216"]}
{"title": "Software reuse within the earth science community\n", "abstract": " Scientific missions in the Earth sciences frequently require cost-effective, highly reliable, and easy-to-use software, which can be a challenge for software developers to provide. The NASA Earth science community spends a significant amount of resources developing software components and other software development artifacts that may also be of value if reused in other projects requiring similar functionality. In general, software reuse is often defined as utilizing existing software artifacts. Software reuse can improve productivity and quality while decreasing the cost of software development, as documented by case studies in the literature. Since large software systems are often the results of the integration of many smaller and sometimes reusable components, ensuring reusability of such software components becomes a necessity. Indeed, designing software components with reusability as a requirement can\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2216"]}

It is used in embedded electronics, in flight dynamics, in ground and space data processing, and in the current generation of data products. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s Innovative Partnerships Program Office offers licensing opportunities for software and technologies from a variety of areas relevant to the hardware and software requirements of Earth and space science missions and projects: aerospace/aeronautics, computer software, data processing/analysis, electromechanical devices, electronics, manufacturing equipment, mechanical technologies, nanotechnology, optics and photonics, sensor and detector technologies, subassemblies and components, telecommunications and internet, and test and measurement (IPP Office, 2009). Reuse of existing experience and artifacts eliminates having to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d and is a key element to achieving progress in many areas of complex aerospace system development.Originally, in the absence of vendor-provided solutions and commercial off-the-shelf software components, many data and information systems were designed and built as custom applications.

{"title": "A Community-Developed Measurement of the Reusability of Software Through Reuse Readiness Levels\n", "abstract": " When software is developed with reuse purposes in mind from the start, the resulting product will often be more mature, in a reuse sense, than products which are modified for reuse purposes after they have been developed. But it can be difficult to assess the maturity level of a software product due to the variety of factors that influence its reusability. If these factors could be measured, assessed, and combined into a single scale measuring the maturity of the software in terms of reusability, it would be of great benefit to developers. They will more easily be able to determine how ready the software is for their purposes, and how much modification may be necessary before it can fill their needs.
