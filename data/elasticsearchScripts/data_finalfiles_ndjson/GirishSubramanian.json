{"title": "A probabilistic model for predicting software development effort\n", "abstract": " Recently, Bayesian probabilistic models have been used for predicting software development effort. One of the reasons for the interest in the use of Bayesian probabilistic models, when compared to traditional point forecast estimation models, is that Bayesian models provide tools for risk estimation and allow decision-makers to combine historical data with subjective expert estimates. In this paper, we use a Bayesian network model and illustrate how a belief updating procedure can be used to incorporate decision-making risks. We develop a causal model from the literature and, using a data set of 33 real-world software projects, we illustrate how decision-making risks can be incorporated in the Bayesian networks. We compare the predictive performance of the Bayesian model with popular nonparametric neural-network and regression tree forecasting models and show that the Bayesian model is a competitive\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "253\n", "authors": ["1212"]}

They advocate additional research on the perceptions of the CEO and other top management of the value of IT. The perceptions of top management on the strategic value of infonnation systems (PSVIS) are classified into three types based on a review of the strategic use of information systems literature. The first type is the perception of a support role for information systems (PSVISSUP). This role is supported in the work of Porter and Millar (1985), Kim and Michelman (1990), and other frameworks based on Porter's (1980) work. The second is the perception of information systems as managerial productivity enhancement tools (PSVISPRO). The evidence for this role is seen from the fact that data sharing and communication across departments and the high penetration and use of office automation and communication technology were expressed as needs by CEOs from information technology departments (Moynihan 1990). The third type is the perception of information systems as strategic decision aid tools (PS VISSTR). An example of this role would be the use of Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS) in supporting competitive analysis as illustrated in Dennis, Nunamaker, auid Paranka (1991).

{"title": "An empirical examination of software development modes\n", "abstract": " Organic, embedded, and semidetached are three software development modes conceptualized by Boehm. The presence of these three modes is empirically tested in this study. This study also aims to identify the software development attributes that distinguish these development modes. The identification of these attributes will help us suggest a systematic way to classify a software project based on these attributes into one of the modes.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
{"title": "Implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems: Issues and Challenges\n", "abstract": " Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are a growing area of research in business information systems. The primary purpose of this research is to review the literature on ERP implementation and to present results of a case study on ERP implementation. An exploratory case study was conducted to study these research issues. The case study consisted of a survey and interview of 25 employees at one organization. The results provide data analysis findings from the survey and qualitative findings from the interview. Using this case study, the chapter indicates the presence of four phases in ERP implementation through the support from qualitative interviews. Using t-tests, the results confirm the presence of a positive feeling of users toward the four ERP implementation phases.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
{"title": "An Empirical Study of Learning Curve Theory's application to the Software Development Effort-Experience Relationship in Software Engineering and Project Management\n", "abstract": " The experience of software developers in a given tool is often perceived as an endogenous factor in software cost estimation. Many manufacturing applications have modeled resources devoted to output production, and worker\u2019s knowledge as learning curves. In this paper, we use and test the learning curve theory in software industry. We illustrate that a programmer\u2019s effort exponentially decreases as his/her tool experience increases. After certain amount of tool-experience, the effort reduction asymptotically stabilizes. We believe that the learning curve theory and its application provide an excellent opportunity for IT project managers to better utilize the experience of their software personnel.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
{"title": "User perceptions of voice mail technology: A comparative study of internal and external users\n", "abstract": " User perceptions of usefulness and ease of information technology have been shown by empirical research to influence technology usage and acceptance. The effect of user type, internal or external user, on the user perceptions of voice mail technology is the subject of this empirical research. User type has a significant effect on user perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of voice mail. Further, internal users perceive voice mail to be more useful and easier to use in comparison to the perceptions of external users. Finally, these results are used to help devise a technology transition framework for voice mail introduction and usage in organizations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
{"title": "Connectionist and evolutionary models for learning, discovering and forecasting software effort\n", "abstract": " Mining information and knowledge from very large databases is recognized as a key research area in machine learning and expert systems. In the current research, we use connectionist and evolutionary models for learning software effort. Specifically, we use these models to learn the software effort from a set of training data set containing information on software projects and test the performance of the model on a holdout sample. The design issues of developing connectionist and evolutionary models for mining software effort patterns on a data set are described. Our research indicates that connectionist and evolutionary models, whenever carefully designed, hold a great promise for knowledge discovery and forecasting software effort.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
{"title": "A Delphi Study Of Web-Enabled Technologies: Identification And Prioritization Of Critical Issues\n", "abstract": " The role of the Internet as an enabling technology is critical to the strategic planning of national and local governments, educational institutions, hospitals, manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing companies, and increasingly, for small organizations as much as for larger ones. Like other technologies, the path to effective assimilation of Internet-based technologies has not been free of problems and challenges. This paper presents the results of a Delphi study to identify and rank critical issues for effective deployment of Internet-based technologies in organizations. The critical issues identified in this study provide valuable insights for formulating strategies for the overall utilization and management of Web-enabled technologies in organizations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
{"title": "Performance difference between user customized and standard designer provided interfaces: An empirical study of organizational users\n", "abstract": " Customizing or personalizing user interfaces is a current development in software design. This study empirically examines the effectiveness of the customized interface vs. the standard designer provided interface with respect to accuracy and time for completion of tasks. This study reports an experiment with organizational users performing computer tasks similar to their job-related computer activities. Performance differences between the interfaces, observed in an earlier study with student samples, were supported with organizational users. Customized interface outperformed the standard designer provided interface in our research study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
{"title": "A methodology to attain site specificity and model simplicity in software development effort estimation\n", "abstract": " The dissertation seeks to develop an improved method of Software Development Effort Estimation. Software development effort estimation helps in estimating the person-months for the software project and is useful in:(1) aiding the marketing function for making realistic quotes,(2) ensuring that cost estimates are realistic and reasonable profits are feasible,(3) answering the\" make or buy\" software decision, and (4) manpower and resource planning for software development.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1212"]}
