{"title": "A new approach to automated pollen analysis\n", "abstract": " Palynological data are used in a wide range of applications, but the tasks of classification and counting of pollen grains are highly skilled and laborious. The development of an automated system for pollen identification and classification would be of great benefit. Previous attempts at computer classification have taken approaches that have been intrinsically difficult to develop into fully automated systems that could operate largely independently of a human operator. We describe a new approach to the problem based on improving the quality of the image processing rather than the data collected using images collected with an optical microscope. Two sets of experiments are described, demonstrating the ability of the system firstly, to differentiate between pollen and detritus, and secondly, to classify different pollen types correctly. The results of these tests, in which the pollen images were acquired using an\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "104\n", "authors": ["1896"]}
{"title": "Deterministic parallel processing\n", "abstract": " In order to address the problems faced in the wireless communications domain, picoChip has devised the picoArray\u2122. The picoArray is a tiled-processor architecture, containing several hundred heterogeneous processors, connected through a novel, compile-time scheduled interconnect. This architecture does not suffer from many of the problems faced by conventional general purpose parallel processors and provides an alternative to creating an ASIC. The PC102 is the second generation device from picoChip containing 308 processors. The devices are designed to be connected together using a seamless extension of the internal interconnect structure. This enables multi-chip solutions to be easily realised for applications which require additional processing.

{"title": "Parallel Processing-the picoChip way\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a new approach to parallel processing within the well targetted application domain of wireless communications systems, using the picoArrayTM. The picoArrayTM is a tiled-processor architecture, containing 430 heterogeneous processors, connected through a novel, compile-time scheduled interconnect. We show how the features of the picoArrayTM allow deterministic processing to be achieved, and how the tool chain allows programming to be performed effectively in a combination of high level assembly language and C. By handling a wide variety of types of processing within the picoArrayTM a single design flow can be used to produce complex communications systems. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the use of the picoArrayTM to build a working 3G base-station.", "num_citations": "76\n", "authors": ["1896"]}
{"title": "Communications in a processor array\n", "abstract": " Data is transmitted from a sending processor over a network to one or more receiving processor in a forward direction during an allocated slot, and acknowledge signals are sent in a reverse direction during the same allocated slot, to indicate whether the receiving processor is able to receive data If one or more of the receiving processors indicates that it is unable to receive the data, the data is retransmitted during the next allocated slot. This means that the sending processor is able to determine within the slot period whether a retransmission is necessary, but that the slot period only needs to be long enough for one-way communication.", "num_citations": "54\n", "authors": ["1896"]}

{"title": "A laboratory test-bed for an automated power line inspection system\n", "abstract": " Aerial inspection of overhead power lines using video surveillance techniques requires that the camera acquire and smoothly track the object of interest, usually the top of a wood pole on the 11\u00a0kV electricity distribution network. Methods for achieving this using active vision, where the camera sightline is steered automatically according to features within the image, are reported here. The focus of the paper is the computer simulation and experimental test-bed used to develop, test and assess the performance of the methods. The characteristics of the acquisition method and the visual feedback loop for tracking are described. A computer simulation is used to predict the effect of various error sources on sightline accuracy and to visualise how the image would look to the observer during operation. The construction of a laboratory test rig is described and results for closed-loop visual tracking are presented.", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["1896"]}
{"title": "Lesion classification using skin patterning\n", "abstract": " Background/aims:  The observation that skin line patterning tends to be disrupted by malignant but not non\u2010malignant skin lesions suggests that this could be used as an aid to lesion differentiation. Since recognised differentiating features can be obtained from the simply\u2010captured white light optical image, the possibility of using such images for skin pattern disruption detection is worth exploring. Methods: The skin pattern has been extracted from optical images by high\u2010pass filtering and profiles of local line strength variation with the angle estimated using a new consistent high\u2010value profiling technique. The resultant profile images have been analysed using a novel region\u2010based agglomerative clustering technique (mRAC) and also a local variance measurement. A measure based on the relationship between the classification results and an intensity\u2010based segmentation was calculated, and this represented the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["1896"]}
{"title": "A comparative study of approaches to automatic pollen identification.\n", "abstract": " The analysis of pollen grains taken from core samples is an extremely valuable technique for climate reconstruction. There is a great need for an automated classification system which can provide a swift and accurate analysis of the relative amounts of pollen on a microscope slide. Pollen grains have a complex three-dimensional structure and can appear on the microscope slide in any orientation. Despite efforts to improve the preparation of the slides a large amount of debris is also present. This paper describes work being conducted to reliably separate pollen grains from debris. Two methods of pollen identification are compared, a model based approach and a self-training, deformable template neural network. The model based approach is shown to accurately describe the pollen grains used in the test but requires considerable refinement to be useful whereas the neural network provides excellent results comparable to a human operator.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["1896"]}
{"title": "Colour segmentation for lesion classification\n", "abstract": " The incidence of skin cancer is increasing globally. Prognosis falls quickly as malignant skin cancers develop and so early detection is paramount in the fight against this disease. Colour is an important feature in the differential diagnosis of skin cancers in particular malignant melanoma. This paper describes a region based approach to segmentation of lesion images into areas of differing colour. The process initially divides the image into rectangular regions small enough to be considered as having only a single colour. This is then followed by conservative merging, where adjacent regions whose colours are very similar are coalesced. The segmentation is then completed by an iterative optimal merging process, the two most similar regions being merged at each step until the stopping condition is reached. Results show that the method produces a robust segmentation of regions of high colour contrast.", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["1896"]}
{"title": "Boundary detection for skin lesions: an edge focusing algorithm\n", "abstract": " The accurate location of the boundary of skin lesions is an important first step in the automatic diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The use of standard edge detectors for skin lesion boundary detection has serious shortcomings since those giving sufficiently detailed borders are sensitive to spurious small scale structure elsewhere in the image while those which ignore small scale structure involve low-pass filtering which loses border detail. Edge focusing uses edge detectors of progressively smaller scale, each focusing only in the region of the boundary estimated by the previous detector. This results in a series of boundary position estimates of increasingly finer scale while eliminating spurious edges resulting from noise and other image detail. The selection of the \u201cbest fit\u201d boundary is made by comparison of the contrast between narrow regions just inside and outside the boundary or from the variance of image\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["1896"]}

{"title": "Deformation invariant pattern classification for recognising hand gestures\n", "abstract": " A three stage self-organising neural network architecture has been developed to perform recognition of static hand gestures from images. Feature extraction is performed on grey-scale images by the primary stage. The second and third stage perform the recognition process. Images not recognised generate new classes by adding neural components into the second and third stage of the network. By the additional use of a hypothesis testing mechanism the network can be made to perform with no misclassifications. The network is successfully applied to a set of hand gestures by selecting network parameters according to a set of heuristic rules. The control over classification and the effects of the hypothesis testing mechanism are demonstrated using two contrasting methods of image presentation.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1896"]}
