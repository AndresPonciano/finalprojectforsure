{"title": "Cryptocurrency trading: a comprehensive survey\n", "abstract": " In recent years, the tendency of the number of financial institutions including cryptocurrencies in their portfolios has accelerated. Cryptocurrencies are the first pure digital assets to be included by asset managers. Even though they share some commonalities with more traditional assets, they have a separate nature of its own and their behaviour as an asset is still under the process of being understood. It is therefore important to summarise existing research papers and results on cryptocurrency trading, including available trading platforms, trading signals, trading strategy research and risk management. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cryptocurrency trading research, by covering 126 research papers on various aspects of cryptocurrency trading (eg., cryptocurrency trading systems, bubble and extreme condition, prediction of volatility and return, crypto-assets portfolio construction and crypto-assets, technical trading and others). This paper also analyses datasets, research trends and distribution among research objects (contents/properties) and technologies, concluding with some promising opportunities that remain open in cryptocurrency trading.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["2030"]}

Some data structures share a common interface and enjoy multiple implementations. We call them Darwinian Data Structures (DDS), since we can subject their implementations to survival of the fittest. We introduce ARTEMIS a multi-objective, cloud-based search-based optimisation framework that automatically finds optimal, tuned DDS modulo a test suite, then changes an application to use that DDS. ARTEMIS achieves substantial performance improvements for every project in 5 Java projects from DaCapo benchmark, 8 popular projects and 30 uniformly sampled projects from GitHub. For execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption, ARTEMIS finds at least one solution that improves all measures for 86%(37/43) of the projects. The median improvement across the best solutions is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2030"]}

In this paper, we demonstrate how artemis, a multiobjective, cloud-based optimisation framework can automatically find optimal, tuned data structures and how it is used for optimising the Guava library. From the proposed solutions that artemis found,  of them improve all measures (execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption).

{"title": "Ascertaining price formation in cryptocurrency markets with DeepLearning\n", "abstract": " The cryptocurrency market is amongst the fastest-growing of all the financial markets in the world. Unlike traditional markets, such as equities, foreign exchange and commodities, cryptocurrency market is considered to have larger volatility and illiquidity. This paper is inspired by the recent success of using deep learning for stock market prediction. In this work, we analyze and present the characteristics of the cryptocurrency market in a high-frequency setting. In particular, we applied a deep learning approach to predict the direction of the mid-price changes on the upcoming tick. We monitored live tick-level data from  cryptocurrency pairs and applied both statistical and machine learning techniques to provide a live prediction. We reveal that promising results are possible for cryptocurrencies, and in particular, we achieve a consistent  accuracy on the prediction of the mid-price movement on live exchange rate of Bitcoins vs US dollars.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2030"]}
{"title": "Mutation-based genetic improvement of software\n", "abstract": " Genetic Improvement (GI) of software is a recent field that has drawn much attention from Software Engineering researchers. It aims to use search techniques to automatically modify and improve existing software. The drawback in previous GI approaches is scalability of these approaches, due to the large search space formed by the code base in real-world systems. To overcome the scalability challenge, more recent studies have confined the granularity of code modification at the statement level and applied a prior sensitivity analysis to further reduce the search space. However, some software improvements may require code changes at a finer level of granularity. This thesis demonstrates that, by combining with Mutation Testing techniques, GI can operate at this finer granularity while preserving scalability. The thesis applies Mutation Operators to automatically modify the source code of the target software. After a prior sensitivity analysis on First Order Mutants, \"deep\" (previously unavailable) parameters are exposed from the most sensitive locations, followed by a bi-objective optimisation process to fine tune them together with existing (\"shallow\") parameters. The objective is to improve both time and memory resources required by the computation. Since this approach relies on the selection of Mutation Operators and traditional Mutation Operators are not concerned with memory performance, the thesis proposes and evaluates Memory Mutation Operators in the Mutation Testing context. Using both traditional and Memory Mutation Operators, the thesis further seeks to improve the target software by searching for Higher Order Mutants (HOMs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2030"]}

We show that there are universal features amongst cryptocurrencies which lead to models outperforming asset-specific ones. We also show that there is little point in feeding machine learning models with long sequences of data points; predictions do not improve. Furthermore, we solve the technical challenge to design a lean predictor\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2030"]}
{"title": "Better Model Selection with a new Definition of Feature Importance\n", "abstract": " Feature importance aims at measuring how crucial each input feature is for model prediction. It is widely used in feature engineering, model selection and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). In this paper, we propose a new tree-model explanation approach for model selection. Our novel concept leverages the Coefficient of Variation of a feature weight (measured in terms of the contribution of the feature to the prediction) to capture the dispersion of importance over samples. Extensive experimental results show that our novel feature explanation performs better than general cross validation method in model selection both in terms of time efficiency and accuracy performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2030"]}
{"title": "Ieo: Intelligent evolutionary optimisation for hyperparameter tuning\n", "abstract": " Hyperparameter optimisation is a crucial process in searching the optimal machine learning model. The efficiency of finding the optimal hyperparameter settings has been a big concern in recent researches since the optimisation process could be time-consuming, especially when the objective functions are highly expensive to evaluate. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent evolutionary optimisation algorithm which applies machine learning technique to the traditional evolutionary algorithm to accelerate the overall optimisation process of tuning machine learning models in classification problems. We demonstrate our Intelligent Evolutionary Optimisation (IEO)in a series of controlled experiments, comparing with traditional evolutionary optimisation in hyperparameter tuning. The empirical study shows that our approach accelerates the optimisation speed by 30.40% on average and up to 77.06% in the best scenarios.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2030"]}
{"title": "Checkers: Multi-modal darwinian API optimisation\n", "abstract": " Advent of microservices has increased the popularity of the API-first design principles. Developers have been focusing on concretising the API to a system before building the system. An API-first approach assumes that the API will be correctly used. Inevitably, most developers, even experienced ones, end-up writing sub-optimal software because of using APIs incorrectly. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach for exploring API equivalence and a framework to synthesise semantically equivalent programs. Unlike existing approaches to API transplantation, we propose an amorphous or formless approach to software translation in which a single API could potentially be replaced by a synthesised sequence of APIs which ensures type progress. Our search is guided by the non-functional goals for the software, a type-theoretic notion of progress, the application's test suite and an automatic multi-modal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2030"]}
