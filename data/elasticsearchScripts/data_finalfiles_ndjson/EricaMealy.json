{"title": "Improving usability of software refactoring tools\n", "abstract": " Post-deployment maintenance and evolution can account for up to 75% of the cost of developing a software system. Software refactoring can reduce the costs associated with evolution by improving system quality. Although refactoring can yield benefits, the process includes potentially complex, error-prone, tedious and time-consuming tasks. It is these tasks that automated refactoring tools seek to address. However, although the refactoring process is well-defined, current refactoring tools do not support the full process. To develop better automated refactoring support, we have completed a usability study of software refactoring tools. In the study, we analysed the task of software refactoring using the ISO 9241-11 usability standard and Fitts' List of task allocation. Expanding on this analysis, we reviewed 11 collections of usability guidelines and combined these into a single list of 38 guidelines. From this list, we\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "74\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "BegBunch: benchmarking for C bug detection tools\n", "abstract": " Benchmarks for bug detection tools are still in their infancy. Though in recent years various tools and techniques were introduced, little effort has been spent on creating a benchmark suite and a harness for a consistent quantitative and qualitative performance measurement. For assessing the performance of a bug detection tool and determining which tool is better than another for the type of code to be looked at, the following questions arise: 1) how many bugs are correctly found, 2) what is the tool's average false positive rate, 3) how many bugs are missed by the tool altogether, and 4) does the tool scale.", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "Evaluating software refactoring tool support\n", "abstract": " Up to 75% of the costs associated with the development of software systems occur post-deployment during maintenance and evolution. Software refactoring is a process that can significantly reduce the costs associated with software evolution. Refactoring is defined as internal modification of source code to improve system quality, without change to observable behaviour. Tool support for software refactoring attempts to further reduce evolution costs by automating manual, error-prone and tedious tasks. Although the process of refactoring is well-defined, tools supporting refactoring do not support the full process. Existing tools suffer from issues associated with the level of automation, the stages of the refactoring process supported or automated, the subset of refactorings that can be applied, and complexity of the supported refactorings. This paper presents a framework for evaluating software refactoring tool support\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "The impact of human activities on Australian wildlife\n", "abstract": " Increasing human population size and the concomitant expansion of urbanisation significantly impact natural ecosystems and native fauna globally. Successful conservation management relies on precise information on the factors associated with wildlife population decline, which are challenging to acquire from natural populations. Wildlife Rehabilitation Centres (WRC) provide a rich source of this information. However, few researchers have conducted large-scale longitudinal studies, with most focussing on narrow taxonomic ranges, suggesting that WRC-associated data remains an underutilised resource, and may provide a fuller understanding of the anthropogenic threats facing native fauna. We analysed admissions and outcomes data from a WRC in Queensland, Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, to determine the major factors driving admissions and morbidity of native animals in a region experiencing rapid and prolonged urban expansion. We studied 31,626 admissions of 83 different species of native birds, reptiles, amphibians, marsupials and eutherian mammals from 2006 to 2017. While marsupial admissions were highest (41.3%), admissions increased over time for all species and exhibited seasonal variation (highest in Spring to Summer), consistent with known breeding seasons. Causes for admission typically associated with human influenced activities were dominant and exhibited the highest mortality rates. Car strikes were the most common reason for admission (34.7%), with dog attacks (9.2%), entanglements (7.2%), and cat attacks (5.3%) also high. Admissions of orphaned young and overt signs of disease were significant at 24\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "Exploring physical activities in an employer-sponsored health program\n", "abstract": " This work brings a perspective from an employer-sponsored health and wellness program called Global Corporate Challenge (GCC) to the'quantified self'research. We present preliminary findings from a study with 17 university employees who participated in the GCC. We aimed to explore how participants derived meaningfulness from their self-tracking experiences. Our findings echo the growing body of work that advocates for conceptualizing activity tracking beyond the rationalistic, data-oriented perspectives and supporting more social and lived experiences.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "Regional entrepreneurship ecosystems support: South East Queensland as case study\n", "abstract": " The literature on support within entrepreneurship ecosystems is in emergence, characterized by multiple levels of analysis, different stages of development, and different conceptualizations of regionality, without the ability to extend a successful model from one region to another. Given the emergent stage of development and the need regions have to locally develop their own ecosystems, this chapter provides a framework to study the support provided by different role players within the system and proposes dimensions to study the interdependencies in providing support. The proposed framework was illustrated and revised using a case study from South East Queensland, Australia, drawing on documents, interviews and observations. This paper contributes to the literature by providing a framework, with associated dimensions of support for entrepreneurs that is useful to understand the contributions of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "Building personas of students accessing a peer-facilitated support for learning program\n", "abstract": " The modern student represents a change from the traditional learner. More than ever before, additional resources are available online and yet personalised learning and peer-assistance programs are becoming an essential part of tertiary education delivery. This paper presents the first stage in a user-centred design approach to the analysis of the completeness and efficacy of such a personalised, peer-based support for learning program. This approach used an iterative design methodology based on contextual interview, workshops and focus groups to develop personas representing students visiting the program. Initial uses of these developed personas have included training of new personnel as well as the evaluation of the program. Overall the use of this user-centred approach and iterative persona development methodology has yielded an invaluable resource for the design of support for learning programs\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "Integration of generic program analysis tools into a software development environment\n", "abstract": " Support for program understanding in development and maintenance tasks can be facilitated by program analysis techniques. The flow analysis techniques of control-flow and data-flow analysis support program comprehension through the provision of graphical and interactive representations.This paper outlines the addition of program analysis support to a generic language-based environment via the construction of the automatically generated Graph Builder, and hand-crafted generic Analysis tool components. These generically implemented tools represent a significant advancement in integrated program understanding support within a software development environment and the integration of these tools represents a step towards an ideal language support environment as definitively presented by the Stoneman requirements specification. The realisation of flow analysis support tools for program understanding further requires the development of new techniques for calculating execution characteristics and modification-use relationships of control-flow graph nodes within the context of a generic environment supporting relational navigation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "Modelling for Knowledge Discovery\n", "abstract": " Modernization of legacy systems requires that a clear understanding be gained of those systems. In this position paper it is proposed that this understanding is best supported by modelling specific key aspects of the system. The validity or not of modelling is not argued, but rather the aspects that should be modelled are discussed. It is believed that the aspects will be of interest to all involved in modernization of legacy systems and not only those from the modelling community. The modelling approach taken in this work is derived from an initial submission [1] to the Object Management Group\u2019s (OMG) Request for Proposal on Knowledge Discovery for Architecture-Driven Modernization [3].", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
{"title": "Motivation and behavioural patterns of students accessing a peer-facilitated support for learning program\n", "abstract": " This paper describes the development and use of personas, a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research methodology, within the STIMulate peer learning program, in order to better understand student behaviour patterns and motivations. STIMulate is a support for learning program at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia. The program provides assistance in mathematics, science and information technology (IT) for course work students. A STIMulate space is provided for students to study and obtain one-on-one assistance from Peer Learning Facilitators (PLFs), who are experienced students that have excelled in relevant subject areas. This paper describes personas \u2013 archetypal users - that represent the motivations and behavioural patterns of students that utilise STIMulate (particularly the IT stream). The personas were developed based on interviews with PLFs, and subsequently validated by a PLF focus group. Seven different personas were developed. The personas enable us to better understand the characteristics of the students utilising the STIMulate program. The research provides a clearer picture of visiting student motivations and behavioural patterns. This has helped us identify gaps in the services provided, and be more aware of our assumptions about students. The personas have been deployed in PLF training programs, to help PLFs provide a better service to the students. The research findings suggest further study on the resonances between some students and PLFs, which we would like to better elicit.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1900"]}
