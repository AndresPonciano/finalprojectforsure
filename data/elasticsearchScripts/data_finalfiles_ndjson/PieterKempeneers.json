{"title": "Framing the concept of satellite remote sensing essential biodiversity variables: challenges and future directions\n", "abstract": " Although satellite\u2010based variables have for long been expected to be key components to a unified and global biodiversity monitoring strategy, a definitive and agreed list of these variables still remains elusive. The growth of interest in biodiversity variables observable from space has been partly underpinned by the development of the essential biodiversity variable (EBV) framework by the Group on Earth Observations \u2013 Biodiversity Observation Network, which itself was guided by the process of identifying essential climate variables. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by updating the previously published definition of EBV, providing a definition of satellite remote sensing (SRS) EBVs and introducing a set of principles that are believed to be necessary if ecologists and space agencies are to agree on a list of EBVs that can be routinely monitored from space\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "211\n", "authors": ["912"]}

However, uncontrolled fires cause large environmental and economic damages, especially in the Mediterranean region. On average, about 65000 fires occur in Europe every year, burning approximately half a million ha of wildland and forest areas; most of the burnt area, over 85%, is in the European Mediterranean region. Trends in number of fires and burnt areas in the Mediterranean region are presented in Fig. 1.Recent analyses of the available data in the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) show that over 95% of the fires in Europe are human-induced.

These measurements are strongly correlated, and no new information might be added when increasing the spectral resolution. Moreover, the higher number of spectral bands increases the complexity of a classification task. Therefore, feature reduction is a crucial step. An alternative would be to choose the required sensor bands settings a priori. In this letter, we introduce a statistical procedure to provide band settings for a specific classification task. The proposed procedure selects wavelength band settings which optimize the separation between the different spectral classes. The method is applicable as a band reduction technique, but it can as well serve the purpose of data interpretation or be an aid in sensor design.

In the second step, a new classifier refines the generalized LC classes to create distinct subclasses of its parent class, using the generalized LC map as a mask. This classifier uses all image information (bands) available at both fine and coarse spatial resolutions. We followed a simple data fusion technique by stacking the individual image bands into a multidimensional vector. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the spatial detail of the generalized LC classes is retained in the final LC map.

To demonstrate the approach, time series of 30-m spatial resolution NDVI images at 16-day time steps were generated using Landsat NDVI images and MODIS NDVI products at four sites with different ecosystems and land cover-land use dynamics. The results show that the time series of synthetic NDVI images captured seasonal land surface dynamics and maintained the spatial structure of the landscape at higher spatial resolution. The time series of synthetic medium-resolution NDVI images were validated within a Monte Carlo simulation framework. Normalized residuals decreased as the number of available observations increased, ranging from 0.2 to below 0.1. Residuals were also significantly lower for time series of synthetic NDVI images generated at combined recursion (smoothing) than individually at forward and backward recursions (filtering).

{"title": "Optimized Spectral Angle Mapper classification of spatially heterogeneous dynamic dune vegetation, a case study along the Belgian coastline\n", "abstract": " Vegetation classification starting from hyperspectral images is a widely used technique for material identification and mapping. The unknown pixels are assigned to a certain vegetation type whose reference spectrum is derived from the hyperspectral imagery by means of Regions Of Interest (ROIs). The standard Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), available in most image processing software packages, uses the average spectrum of each ROI. This implies that the spectral variability within each ROI, denoted as the intra-class variability, is not retained. To preserve the intra-class variability, an Optimized Spectral Angle Mapper (OSAM) was developed consisting of two parts. Firstly an Optimal Spectral Library (OSL) is generated which preserves the spectral variability present within each ROI. This library can be considered as \u2018optimal\u2019since it contains the spectra that classify all pixels of a certain class correctly, without misclassifying pixels which do not belong to that class. At the same time, for each reference spectrum, a maximum spectral angle distance is calculated which is used in the second step to avoid misclassifications. Secondly, all image pixels are classified using the reference spectra stored in the OSL, taking into account the calculated maximum spectral angle distance. This means that each pixel will be assigned to the class of the reference spectrum for which the smallest spectral angle value was calculated with the actual pixel spectrum. Accuracy assessment was done using a part of the ROIs for training, while the remaining part of the ROIs was used for validation.

{"title": "Development of robust hyperspectral indices for the detection of deviations of normal plant state\n", "abstract": " This research was conducted to assess the potential of hyperspectral indices to detect iron defi-ciency in capital-intensive multi-annual crop systems. A well-defined hyperspectral multi-layer dataset was constructed for a peach orchard in Zaragoza, Spain, consisting of hyperspectral measurements at various monitoring levels (leaf, crown, airborne). Trees were subjected to four different treatments of iron application (0 g / tree, 60 g / tree, 90 g / tree, and 120 g / tree). Ground-based measurements were used to characterise the on-site peach (Prunus persica L.) orchard in terms of chlorophyll, dry matter, water content, and leaf area index (LAI). Indices were extracted from the spectral profiles by means of band reduction techniques based on logistic regression and narrow-waveband ratioing involving all possible two-band combinations. Physiological interpreta-tions extracted from leaf-level experiments were extrapolated to crown- and airborne level. It was concluded from leaf level measurements that a decrease in leaf chlorophyll concentration resulted due to iron deficiency. The results suggested that spectral bands and narrow waveband ratio vege-tation indices, selected via multivariate logistic regression classification, were able to distinguish iron untreated and iron treated trees (C-values>0.8). Moreover, the most appropriate indices ob-tained in this manner fulfilled the expectations by being highly correlated (R2>0.6) to the measured chlorophyll concentrations. The visible part of the spectrum, mostly dominated by the amount of pigments (e.g. chlorophyll, carotenoids), provided the most discriminative spectral region (505 - 740 nm) in this study\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["912"]}

This must allow service providers such as the Copernicus Global Land Service to extend the 16-year long timeseries of SPOTVEGETATION global 1km data with similar PROBA-V products. To evaluate the extent of spectral consistency, an evaluation of spectral response differences is performed by applying the spectral response of PROBA-V and SPOT-VEGETATION 2 to a spectral library of representative global land cover conditions.

Random forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat.

The noted deficiency can be regarded as a proxy for deviations from optimal plant functioning, while detection of such deviations is in turn of significant importance to monitoring and modelling efforts of orchards as production systems. Hyperspectral leaf, canopy, and airborne reflectance measurements were acquired in a peach (Prunus persica L.) orchard in Zaragoza, Spain. Leaf- and canopy-level data were collected with a handheld spectroradiometer (ASD, Inc.), while the AHS-160 hyperspectral sensor provided airborne data. Blocks of trees were treated with different amount of iron chelates (Sequestrene) which created a dynamic range of chlorophyll concentration as measured in leaves. Hyperspectral measurements at leaf-level were carried out to characterize the physiological aspects of nutrient stress, as opposed to the evaluation of plant nutrient status at the complete plant-level. Stressinduced physiological changes make stress detection at the leaf-level possible at an early stage of suboptimal photosynthetic functioning.

{"title": "Information extraction techniques for monitoring of stress symptoms in orchards\n", "abstract": " A hyperspectral data cube contains a huge amount of data. For most applications the relevant information is located within only a few bands. The selection of the relevant bands without loss of essential information is therefore a critical issue. In this project band selection and classification algorithms are developed and validated for precision farming applications, more precisely for the detection of stress symptoms in fruit trees. Experimental test plots are established in apple orchards. The apple trees are put under different types of stress (fungal infection, nutrient stress, aphids and virus). Three times throughout the growing season of 2002 leaves were sampled from both healthy and reference plots and their reflectance was determined. Nearly coincident in time reflectance measurements were performed above the trees. Finally CASI-2 (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager, Itres) and SASI (Shortwave Infrared Airborne Spectrographic Sensor, Itres) images were collected at the experimental test plots in September 2002. To detect under these increasing complex conditions (leaf, tree, airborne level) subtle reflectance differences between stressed and healthy trees, two different band reduction approaches are evaluated. In the first approach various spectral vegetation indices are calculated and tested as stress indicator at the leaf and tree level. The second approach evaluates the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) as a tool for feature reduction and classification of the obtained reflectance data sets. Best results are obtained for the nutrient deficiency plots. Both methodologies are able to distinguish nutrient-deficient trees from their references\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["912"]}
{"title": "pyjeo: A Python Package for the Analysis of Geospatial Data\n", "abstract": " A new Python package, pyjeo, that deals with the analysis of geospatial data has been created by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Adopting the principles of open science, the JRC strives for transparency and reproducibility of results. In this view, it has been decided to release pyjeo as free and open software. This paper describes the design of pyjeo and how its underlying C/C++ library was ported to Python. Strengths and limitations of the design choices are discussed. In particular, the data model that allows the generation of on-the-fly data cubes is of importance. Two uses cases illustrate how pyjeo can contribute to open science. The first is an example of large-scale processing, where pyjeo was used to create a global composite of Sentinel-2 data. The second shows how pyjeo can be imported within an interactive platform for image analysis and visualization. Using an innovative mechanism that interprets Python code within a C++ library on-the-fly, users can benefit from all functions in the pyjeo package. Images are processed in deferred mode, which is ideal for prototyping new algorithms on geospatial data, and assess the suitability of the results created on the fly at any scale and location.

{"title": "Propagation of shadow effects on typical remote sensing applications in forestry\n", "abstract": " Airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data were acquired over a broadleaved forest area in Belgium. Shadow fractions were calculated, based on Sun angles and a digital surface model derived from the LiDAR data. Pixels in the hyper-spectral image were classified based on the shadow fractions to study the effect of shadow on canopy reflectance and how the effect propagated to typical remote sensing applications in forestry. As a first application, the photosynthetical reflectance index (PRI) was studied, which expresses the relative down-regulation of photosynthesis. A strong correlation (R 2  = 0.93) was found between the shadow fraction and the PRI. The second application was a tree species classification problem. A measure for classification uncertainty (CU) was introduced, based on the Shannon entropy. It was shown that the majority of pixels with a low shadow fraction were classified with a lower uncertainty.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["912"]}

{"title": "Assimilation of sparse crown by using GO and GORT model with remotely sensed data in the Tarim River Basin, Xinjiang, China\n", "abstract": " The sparse crown along both riversides of the Tarim River plays an important role in firming the sand and restraining the desertification. It is very difficult to obtain the spectrum information from the remotely sensed data because of the low percentage of coverage of the sparse vegetation, which affects the classification accuracy of the identification of ground objects and the extraction of vegetation biophysics. It is a key obstruction in developing the quantification of the RS technology. Taking the sparse vegetation at the Tarim River Basin as the research object, this paper predicts the surface bidirectional reflectance of the discontinuous plant canopies in the extremely arid based on the observed ground spectrum. Two different approaches are presented for the tree and the shrub. The first is to simulate the spectrum of the tree with the Geometric Optical-Radiative Transfer model based on ground observation.

{"title": "Imaging spectroscopy and Integrated Coastal Zone Management, a promising marriage\n", "abstract": " This paper provides an overview of the coastal and marine applications which make use of Imaging Spectroscopy (IS), recently under development in Vito. It should be considered as a concise overview rather than an in depth presentation of one application or development. The first two applications focus on sediment mapping; firstly, a classification of sediment habitat types of the Molenplaat, a tidal sand bank in the Westerschelde, is presented. By means of feature selection and a supervised binary classification approach the sediment is classified according to its grain size, moisture content, organic matter content and chlorophyll-a concentration. The second application uses airborne IS to classify the different sand types present along the Belgian coast, in combination with airborne laserscanning to derive accurate erosion maps. The combination of both data products results in a method which proves to be very suited to monitoring the sand transport processes along the Belgian coast. Afterwards two aquatic applications are presented; in the first, coral reef communities in Indonesia are classified. Extensive field work served to collect a spectral library which is used to classify the coral reef communities in as much detail and as accurately as possible. The second aquatic application addresses the difficult challenge of quantifying the amount of suspended sediment and chlorophyll-a in water and rivers; this is performed by inversion of a bio-optical model using a set of Specific Inherent Optical Properties (SIOP\u2019s) measured in-situ. Many marine applications ask for some specific processing steps which are inherent to the aquatic environment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["912"]}
