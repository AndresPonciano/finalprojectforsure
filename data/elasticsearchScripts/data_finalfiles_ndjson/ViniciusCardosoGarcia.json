{"title": "A systematic review on cloud computing\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing is an ascending technology that has introduced a new paradigm by rendering a rational computational model possible. It has changed the dynamics of IT consumption by means of a model that provides on-demand services over the Internet. Unlike the traditional hosting service, cloud computing services are paid for per usage and may expand or shrink based on demand. Such services are, in general, fully managed by cloud providers that require users nothing but a personal computer and an Internet access. In recent years, this model has attracted the attention of researchers, investors and practitioners, many of whom have proposed a number of applications, structures and fundamentals of cloud computing, resulting in various definitions, requirements and models.

For this purpose it is necessary to build a robust architecture that satisfies a minimal number of requirements such as distributed sensing, integrated management and flexibility. Several architectures have been proposed with different goals, but none of them met satisfactorily the needs that permeate smart cities. In this work various architectures are discussed, highlighting the main requirements that they aim to fulfill. Furthermore, based on different architectures with the most varied purposes, a set of requirements for the implementation of a smart city is presented and discussed.", "num_citations": "123\n", "authors": ["1526"]}

The major disadvantages of this approach are learners' lack of motivation during class and their quickly forgetting the knowledge they have acquired. With a view to overcoming these difficulties, Problem Based Learning (PBL), an institutional method of teaching, has been applied to teaching computing disciplines. Despite the growth of the practice of PBL in various disciplines of Computing, there is little evidence of its specific characteristics in this area, the effectiveness of different PBL methodological approaches, or of benefits and challenges encountered. In this context, this paper presents a systematic mapping study in order to identify studies which involve best practices when using the PBL method in Computing between 1997 and 2011, answering five research\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["1526"]}

This is happening mainly because the Web is going into a new phase, called programmable Web, where several Web-based systems make their APIs publicly available. In order to deal with the complexity of this emerging Web, we define the notion of a Social Machine and envisage a language that can describe networks of such. To start with, we define a Social Machine (SM) as a \u201cconnectable and programmable building block that wraps (WI) an information processing system (IPS) and defines a set of required (RS) and provided services (PS), dynamically available under constraints (C) which are determined by, among other things, its relationships (Rel) with others\u201d. In other words, a SM is a connected machine, usually to the Web, which dynamically provides and/or requires a set of services according to its established relationships. Any application in the Web can be seen as a SM. In order to make feasible the practical application of the aforementioned Social Machine concept, we define SMADL \u2013 the Social Machines Architecture Description Language \u2013 as an attempt to be a completely different way to program the Web, mixing concepts from Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).

It has changed the dynamics of IT consumption by means of a model that provides on-demand services over the Internet. Unlike the traditional hosting service, cloud computing services are paid for per usage and may expand or shrink based on demand. Such services are, in general, fully managed by cloud providers that require users nothing but a personal computer and an Internet access. In recent years, this model has attracted the attention of researchers, investors and practitioners, many of whom have proposed a number of applications, structures and fundamentals of cloud computing, resulting in various definitions, requirements and models. Despite the interest and advances in the field, issues such as security and privacy, service layer agreement, resource sharing, and billing have opened up new questions about the real gains of the model. Although cloud computing is based on a 50-year-old business model, evidence from this study indicates that cloud computing still needs to expand and overcome present limitations that prevent the full use of its potential.

The development of multi-tenancy web application (one of the main ways to provide SaaS) increased considerably after the start of call\" Web 2.0 Age\". This work presents an approach for implementation of a multi-tenancy SaaS application, and an architecture based on plugins and metaprogramming to achieve a high level software reuse.

Through the aggregation and replication techniques, this model offer more robustness and performance when compared to client-server model. In this context, where the peer-to-peer paradigm was selected to development the U-Store, a data cloud solution project, this article presents an architectural proposal towards to create distributed and scalable services, aiming to solve the known issues such as latency, performance, load balancing and so on.Resumo. O aumento da popularidade de redes peer-to-peer, est\u00e1 relacionado com o compartilhamento de recursos descentralizado, onde os pares podem trocar mensagens entre si. Atrav\u00e9s de t\u00e9cnicas de agrega\u00e7ao e de replica\u00e7ao, este modelo oferece mais robustez e desempenho quando comparado ao modelo cliente-servidor. Neste contexto, onde o paradigma peer-to-peer (p2p) foi selecionado para o desenvolvimento do U-Store, uma solu\u00e7ao de dados em nuvem, este artigo apresenta uma proposta de arquitetura para a cria\u00e7ao de servi\u00e7os distribu\u0131dos e escal\u00e1veis, com o objetivo de solucionar questoes relativasa lat\u00eancia, desempenho, balanceamento de carga dentre outros.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1526"]}

In the Organize Legacy Code step, the legacy code is organized, using transformations, according to the principles of the Object Orientation, segmenting it in supposed classes, attributes and methods. The Recover Project step starts from the organized legacy code and also using software transformations, generates its project description in the MDL (Modeling Domain Language) language. The MDL descriptions are read in a CASE tool, recovering the legacy code project, represented with UML techniques. In the Reproject step, the Software Engineer reprojects the system with distributed software components. New functional and non-functional requirements can be added in this step. Finally, in the Reimplement step, the system reimplementation is done in an executable language target of the reimplementation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1526"]}
