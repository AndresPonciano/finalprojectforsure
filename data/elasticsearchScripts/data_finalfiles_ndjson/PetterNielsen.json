We introduce the organic notion of grafting to help explore innovation processes in settings where control is distributed and episodic. Our case study follows the implementation of mobile phone-based reporting of routine data from sub-district health facilities in Malawi. Initial grafting work entails the careful alignment of available resources, capacities, and interests through the proposition of an information system (IS) innovation (eg, mobile phone-based reporting). The nurturing of the implementation involves collaborative efforts spanning technological, professional, geographical, and organizational boundaries. This work is taken forward by the identification of opportunities for merging an innovation with existing socio-technical arrangements (eg, health management information systems in Malawi) in such a way that the parts continue to grow.", "num_citations": "71\n", "authors": ["754"]}
{"title": "The reality beyond the hype: Mobile Internet is primarily an extension of PC-based Internet\n", "abstract": " The mobile Internet (MI) has been hyped as the next big thing by telecom operators, handset manufacturers, and content providers. However, recent studies indicate that the usage of Internet via mobile phones has remained quite flat. The authors inquire into this discrepancy by focusing on actual usage of the MI and the motivating factors behind its use. Based on focus-group interviews in Norway and Hungary, they argue that MI usage is interrelated with and is an extension of the personal computer (PC)\u2013based Internet. The key motivation behind MI use is to attain information in situations in which the PC is out of reach. In effect, MI has not led to the development of new usages. The expectation that the development of new killer applications will lead to an explosion of new usage is therefore misguided. MI usage is and will perhaps continue to be a mere extension of PC-based Internet usage\u2014and such use\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["754"]}

These networks offer a shared resource for information delivery and exchange to communities that appropriate them for their respective purposes. Knowledge and understanding of such information infrastructures\u2019 development process, in particular of how to engage in and proceed to build them over time, are in short supply. We therefore need to develop and strengthen our theoretical understanding of the process by which information infrastructures are built. The aims of this thesis are thus to:(i) develop a conceptual framework to understand the process of building information infrastructures as evolution and construction, and (ii) provide practical insights and guidance to those involved in the building of information infrastructures in the business sector of mobile content services.In order to facilitate the understanding of the process of building information infrastructures, this thesis takes as its starting point the existing conceptualisation of information infrastructures by Ciborra, Hanseth and associates and, in particular, their concepts of heterogeneity, control, standards and evolution. Their conceptualisation pictures the developments of information infrastructure as an evolutionary process which is intrinsically linked to the interplay between human and technical components, while taking into account the distinctive properties of information infrastructures.

We carried out an exploratory assessment of the health information system in Kenya with the main objective of determining the quality of data in terms of accuracy, timeliness and completeness. The study also considered the reasons for the observed data quality status. Data quality audits were carried out in selected health facilities. Data from the source documents at health facilities were compared to the data in the national health information systems for the same period. Key informant interviews were conducted and focus group discussions conducted during quarterly review meetings at regional levels. The study revealed that the completeness rate for the monthly reports was 86.9 percent while the timeliness of the reports was 78.7 percent. In terms of accuracy of the reports, the study showed that while there was a significant amount of low accuracy in many reports evaluated, there was a surprisingly high accuracy of reports coming from the maternity units of all health facilities visited. The accuracy of the number of deliveries could be associated with the financial incentives provided by the government to health facilities as part of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 s free maternity care project in which mothers deliver free of charge in health facilities.

{"title": "Making Usable Generic Software. A Matter of Global or Local Design?\n", "abstract": " Usability is widely acknowledged as a desirable trait of software, referring to how usable it is to a specific set of users. However, when software is developed as generic packages, aimed at supporting variety, designing user interfaces with sufficient sensitivity to use-contexts is a challenge. Extant literature has documented this challenge and established that solving usability-related problems are difficult, both during software development and implementation. Adding to this discussion, this paper contributes by developing a framework to analyze what characterizes usability-related design of generic software. This includes two levels of design; generic-level and implementation-level, and two types of design; design for use and design for design. We apply this conceptual framework on an empirical case based on an ongoing action research project where a global generic health software is implemented in a large state in India. From the analysis we argue that attempts to strengthen usability of generic software require a holistic intervention, considering design on both \u2018global\u2019and \u2018local\u2019level. Of particular importance is how usable the generic software and other design-resources are when implementers are customizing the software.

To measure progress towards this goal, countries need to build robust health information systems. Because countries need to root universal health coverage in primary healthcare, they also needs to sensitively anchor health information systems that support universal health coverage in existing routine health information systems. However, doing so involves significant challenges, which we study via empirically analyzing an Indian state's effort to implement a universal health coverage health information system in primary healthcare.

Two stories of health information system implementations in West Africa are presented. These are stories of integration, interoperability and architecting processes unfolding in a space where different actors pursue different and often conflicting agendas and where power and politics are at play. Our point of departure is an understanding of information systems as information infrastructures, being large scale, complex, and evolving over time. Our analysis of architecting large and complex information systems contributes to an understanding of information system architectures as a process. We argue that information system architecture is not simply made on the drawing board, but are the outcome of negotiations among actors about the division of labour, or role-making and role\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["754"]}

Based on long term support from the Norwegian Research Council, The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Centre for International Cooperation in Education, HISP designs, implements, and supports the sustaining of Health Information Systems in developing countries based on the DHIS 2 software. The approach is fundamentally participatory, supporting the local management of health care delivery and information flows in communities, health facilities, districts, and provinces, and its further spread within and across countries and regions. DHIS 2 is free and open source software for online data management, capturing, validation and analytics. It has a generic data model which can be tailored through the user interface to a wide range of use cases. It can be used to manage statistical data as well as transactional data and personal information, and be accessed from laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Currently, DHIS 2 is in use as a Health Management Information System in more than 30 1 developing countries and even more organizations across four continents.In this essay, we share experiences from three country implementations of DHIS 2 in Africa (Malawi, Kenya, and Uganda) as well as a regional effort in West Africa. In each of these cases, we highlight different lessons learned and challenges we have encountered through our engagement in software development and implementation activities.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["754"]}

{"title": "Implementing public platforms for mobile phone content services: standardization in an era of convergence\n", "abstract": " Mobile Telecommunication standardization in Europe builds on a history formed by European and International standardization bodies, the governments as regulators and the R&D departments of PPT-owned telecommunication operators. This paper describes the standardization approach related to the implementation of the public CPA (Content Provider Access) platform and business model for provision of content services for mobile phones in Norway. CPA builds on complementary services and common incentives for mobile telecommunication operators and content providers to create an open, transparent and easy to access service platform through standardization, but is at the same time developed outside both the scope and the central control of standardization organizations and their standardization practices. The nature of this process can be attributed to processes of convergence. Applying an Information Infrastructure perspective, we discuss the standardization process as open, where the trajectory of development is determined by heterogeneous actors with different and possibly conflicting agendas, powers, needs and incentives. Our aims are both to identify and describe new approaches to standardization as well as new kinds of standards within telecommunications.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["754"]}

The purpose of this paper is to study the development, implementation and rollout of two different communication platforms; Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). By applying a common framework for studying infrastructures, we aim at identifying some of the characteristics that UMTS as well as WLAN resemble.Our analysis of the two platforms reveals that a number of obstacles have to be managed before they may public infrastructures. Both UMTS as well as WLAN have a long way to go, in spite of the high ambitions and efforts that are put into their development. Our concern is not so much how the technical development and implementations efforts will progress, but rather how to manage the process of change and evolution.

Limited data use is both a cause and a result of poor data quality, a vicious circle that is hard to break. This paper investigates the potential in a peer based review strategy to break this vicious circle and contribute to strengthening health information systems (HIS). Methods: This is a case study based on implementation of quarterly zonal reviews in Malawi aimed at strengthening HIS. Data were collected through participant observations, semi structured interviews, focus group discussions, field notes and official documents. Results: The peer based reviews provided an opportunity for skills development of health workers, establishment of learning networks to improve coordination and collaboration among stakeholders and improved data quality and promotion of its use in decision making processes. One of the challenges was inadequate preparations of the districts teams due to lack of facilitators at district level. In addition, some peers were not comfortable to review the work of their colleagues. Conclusions: Peer based reviews can contribute to strengthening HIS in developing countries through promoting learning networks, data quality checks, data use, and enhancing collaboration among managers. The intervention has the potential to break the vicious circle of poor data quality and limited data use and thus contribute to strengthening the health information systems.

{"title": "Organizations failing to learn: Roadblocks to the Implementation of Standardized Information Systems\n", "abstract": " Purpose: Implementing standard health indicators aims at harmonizing fragmented information systems. However, they have not always met this expectation. This article argues that standard information systems fail because organizations fail to learn effective ways of solving problems.Design: Using an interpretive phenomenological approach, we draw examples from the implementation of standard health indicators in Cameroon to explore why organizations fail to learn. We collected data from April and September 2017 from 25 staff in healthcare facilities and district offices.Findings: Staff at the peripheral level encountered multiple levels of organizational challenges. We argue that these challenges are deeply rooted in the organizational structure. Using organizational learning as a lens, we theorize the factors (ie, a disincentive for learning, educational barriers, and organizational culture) that hinder learning. Then identify three beliefs (ie, technological fix, silver bullet, and emperors of the same empire) embedded in organizational structure that hinder organizational learning. Finally, we propose practical measures to mitigate the challenges that impede the implementation of standard health indicators in Cameroon and beyond.Conclusion: Organizations often misplace their attention on what and how they should learn. While they are fast to learn from external sources and are often eager to accommodate information systems, they fail to provide a conducive atmosphere where local experiences thrive, do not value learning from experiences, and adopt few processes to promote learning.Originality: Linking the challenges encountered by staff at\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["754"]}
