These polyploidization events may have had important consequences in plant evolution, in particular for species radiation and adaptation and for the modulation of functional capacities. Here we report a high-quality draft of the genome sequence of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) obtained from a highly homozygous genotype. The draft sequence of the grapevine genome is the fourth one produced so far for flowering plants, the second for a woody species and the first for a fruit crop (cultivated for both fruit and beverage). Grapevine was selected because of its important place in the cultural heritage of humanity beginning during the Neolithic period. Several large expansions of gene families with roles in aromatic features are observed. The grapevine genome has not undergone recent genome duplication, thus enabling the discovery of ancestral traits and features of the genetic organization of flowering plants. This analysis reveals the contribution of three ancestral genomes to the grapevine haploid content. This ancestral arrangement is common to many dicotyledonous plants but is absent from the genome of rice, which is a monocotyledon. Furthermore, we explain the chronology of previously described whole-genome duplication events in the evolution of flowering plants.", "num_citations": "3333\n", "authors": ["1640"]}

Since hybrid systems cannot be studied by either dynamical system techniques or finite state system approaches only, specific formal tools, hybrid automata, were introduced to model them. Intuitively, a hybrid automaton is a \u201cfinite-state\u201d automaton with continuous variables which evolve according to a set of continuous laws. Such kind of automata has been widely used to demonstrate the validity of hybrid system properties and, even if it is proved that many simple verification problems, such as reachability, are not in general decidable over them, various model checking techniques have been proposed in literature. In this dissertation, we further investigate both the notion of hybrid automaton and the model checking problem over such structure. We relate first-order theories and analysis results on multi-valued maps and we reduce bounded reachability problem for hybrid automata whose continuous laws are expressed by inclusions to decidability problem for first-order formul\u00e6 over the reals.

{"title": "Parallel composition of semi-algebraic o-minimal automata\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses questions regarding the decidability of hybrid automata that may be built hierarchically as is the case in many exemplar systems, be it natural or engineered. Parallel composition can be considered a fundamental tool in such costructions. Somewhat surprisingly, this operation does not always preseve the decidability of reachability problem ie, even if we prove the decidability of reachability over component automata, we cannot guarantee the decidability over their parallel composition. Despite the above consideration, this paper establishes the decidability of the reachability problem over parallel composition of semi-algebraic o-minimal automata by reducing it to a system of linear Diophantine disequations whose coefficients are semi-algebraic. The resulting hybrid automata appear in systems biological modeling, and hence could be applied when one is interested in understanding a complex biological system composed of smaller self-organizing systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1640"]}
