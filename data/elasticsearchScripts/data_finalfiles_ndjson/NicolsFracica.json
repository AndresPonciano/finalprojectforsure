Laser ablation (LA) represents one of currently available loco-ablative techniques: light is delivered via flexible quartz fibers of diameter from 300 to 600\u2009\u03bcm inserted into tumor lesion through either fine needles (21g Chiba needles) or large-bore catheters. The thermal destruction of tissue is achieved through conversion of absorbed light (usually infrared) into heat. A range of different imaging modalities have been used to guide percutaneous laser ablation, but ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are most widely employed, according to local experience and resource availability. Available clinical data suggest that LA is highly effective in terms of tumoricidal capability with an excellent safety profile; the best results in terms of long-term survival are obtained in early HCC so that LA can be proposed not only in unresectable cases but, not differently from radiofrequency ablation, also as the first-line treatment.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1930"]}

The continuous cooling of the needle tip allows tissue heating and necrosis far from the electrode without tissue charring, which was the major drawback of the old monopolar technique. Herein we report our preliminary results on feasibility and effectiveness of the thermoablation of mono-or paucifocal hepatocellular carcinoma with the cooled-tip needle. MATERIAL AND METHODS: November, 1996, to January, 1998, we treated thirteen cirrhotic patients (mean age 69.5 yrs, 10 men, 12 HCV-positive; 11 in Child's Class A and 2 in Class B) with 19 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules (mean diameter: 27 mm; range: 10-41 mm; 6 with diameter> 3 cm). None of the patients had portal thrombosis and/or extrahepatic spread. We used a radiofrequency generator (100 W power) connected to an 18 G perfusion electrode needle with an exposed tip of 2-3 cm. The circuit is closed through a dispersive electrode positioned under the patient's thighs. A peristaltic pump infuses a chilled (2-5 degrees C) saline solution to guarantee the continuous cooling of the needle tip. The needle was placed into target lesions under US guidance. The interventional procedure was carried out under general anesthesia using Propofol without intubation. Dynamic CT (more recently with the helical technique) was carried out 15-20 days after thermoablation to assess treatment efficacy. RESULTS: In all, 31 thermal injuries (at 1000-1200 mA for 10-15 minutes) were caused in 21\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["1930"]}

No significant associations were found between the CLIP score and the age, sex, and pattern of vital infection. There was a strong correlation between the CLIP score and the Okuda stage. As of June 1999, 150 patients (76.5%) had died. Median survival time was 11 months, overall, and it was 36, 22, 9, 7, and 3 months for CLIP categories 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 to 6, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the CLIP score had additional explanatory power above that of the Okuda stage. This was true for both patients treated with locoregional therapy or not. A quantitative estimation of 2-year survival predictive power showed that the CLIP score explained 37% of survival variability, compared with 21% explained by Okuda stage. In conclusion, the CLIP score, compared with the Okuda staging system, gives more accurate prognostic information, is statistically more efficient, and has a greater survival predictive power.

{"title": "Irreversible electroporation for hepatic tumors\n", "abstract": " Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a relatively new ablation technique for the treatment of abdominal and extraabdominal tumors. Its working mechanism is essentially non thermal as, through the insertion of probes into the neoplasm during open laparotomy or percutaneously under ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) guidance, it delivers high voltage electric pulses into the target lesion. The resultant electric field causes the formation of nanopores in the cell membrane of neoplastic cells with consequent apoptosis and cell death. The effect of IRE is limited to the cell membrane; for this reason, the adjacent extracellular matrix structures are preserved and this makes this technique a theoretically safe option for tumors located next to blood vessels, bowel loops, urethra (in the case of prostatic cancer) and major bile ducts (in the case of hepatic tumors).

In all cases abdominal US was carried out before and 1-2 days after endoscopy and thereafter at scheduled follow-up visits and/or whenever the patient complained of heartburn, vomiting, a sensation of''absence of the BIB''with or without staining of urine and/or faeces. RESULTS: The BIB appeared as a round anechoic structure, with a thick hyperechoic wall and a hyperechoic band-like valve inside. In 8 cases staining of urine and/or faeces prompted immediate endoscopic removal. In 10 patients US findings of BIB-related complications were: 1) decreased volume with a visible valve (5 cases; in two of these staining of urine was reported); 2) multiple hyperechoic streaks regularly spaced due to a completely collapsed BIB, not modified by decubitus changes (3 cases; one patient reported staining of urine); 3) migration through the bowel (2 cases): in one patient the BIB was passed after 4 days, whereas in the other case bowel obstruction required laparoscopic surgery.

{"title": "\u201cWait and see\u201d policy for early hepatocellular carcinoma\n", "abstract": " We would like to comment on the recent article by Midorikawa and colleagues [1] about the management of early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The authors suggest a \u2018\u2018wait and see\u2019\u2019policy when these lesions are recognized in a cirrhotic liver since the difference between the benefit of resection and observation was negligible in this subgroup of patients. In the authors\u2019 opinion, only overt HCC should be promptly treated whereas early HCC lesions should not be submitted to any form of therapy (including liver resection and percutaneous ablation) because of the treatment-related risks of liver function damage and severe complications. This clinical scenario parallels that of prostate cancer (PC): as it happens for small HCC detected during surveillance programs, more and more small volume tumoral foci are detected on prostatic biopsy ensuing Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) screening [2]. Nowadays, deferred treatment in patients with insignificant disease has been advocated in the belief that radical prostatectomy is associated with significant morbidity and decrease in the quality of life whereas the majority of men are not at risk for dying of the disease, and that those who demonstrate disease progression can be identified and treated before the tumor becomes incurable [2]. As a consequence, over the last decade, active surveillance programs have gained popularity: in suitable candidates, stringent follow-up protocols including repeat biopsy are implemented so as to pick-up early tumoral progression [3]. However, similarities between HCC and PC clinical scenarios end at this point: the two tumors have different natural histories HCC\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1930"]}

{"title": "Ablazione percutanea ecoguidata del carcinoma epatocellulare su cirrosi mediante radiofrequenza con \u00abago freddo\u00bb\n", "abstract": " Introduction. Radiofrequency hyperthermia using the newly-developed \u00abcooled-tip\u00bb needle is one of the latest US-guided percutaneous treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma arising in cirrhosis. The continuous cooling of the needle tip allows tissue heating and necrosis far from the electrode without tissue charring, which was the major drawback of the old monopolar technique. Herein we report our preliminary results on feasibility and effectiveness of the thermoablation of mono-or paucifocal hepatocellular carcinoma with the cooled-tip needle. Material and methods. November, 1996, to January, 1998, we treated thirteen cirrhotic patients (mean age 69.5 yrs, 10 men, 12 HCV-positive; 11 in Child's Class A and 2 in Class B) with 19 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules (mean diameter: 27 mm; range: 10-41 mm; 6 with diameter> 3 cm). None of the patients had portal thrombosis and/or extrahepatic spread. We used a radiofrequency generator (100 W power) connected to an 18 G perfusion electrode needle with an exposed tip of 2-3 cm. The circuit is closed through a dispersive electrode positioned under the patient's thighs. A peristaltic pump infuses a chilled (2-5 C) saline solution to guarantee the continuous cooling of the needle tip. The needle was placed into target lesions under US guidance. The interventional procedure was carried out under general anesthesia using Propofol without intubation. Dynamic CT (more recently with the helical technique) was carried out 15-20 days after thermoablation to assess treatment efficacy. Results. In all, 31 thermal injuries (at 1000-1200 mA for 10-15 minutes) were caused in 21 sessions in the 19\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1930"]}
{"title": "Hemobilia, intrahepatic hematoma and acute cavernomatous transformation of portal vein after US-guided percutaneous thermoablation of a liver metastasis from gastric cancer\n", "abstract": " Radiofrequency Interstitial Hyperthermia (RIH) is a novel method for percutaneous ablation of primary and secondary hepatic tumors.  So far the technique has been considered safe in that major complications have been rarely reported.  Herein, a case of serious and inusual complications ensuing thermoablation of a liver metastasis is described.A 53-year-old-man was seen for palliative treatment of three liver metastases disclosed in the course of a 2     n     d     cycle of chemotherapy, six months after a total gastrectomy with esophagojejunostomy for a T4N2M0 gastric cancer.  All coagulative parameters were permissive.  Under US guidance, a perfusion 19g needle (the so-called   Cool Needle  , 150 mm long with a non-insulated tip of 30 mm), connected to a Radiofrequency Generator (Radionics RFG-3D) was employed to produce 5 thermolesions into the neoplastic nodules: 2 in each nodule of 35 and 25 mm (VII and VI segment), and 1 in the lesion of 17 mm, at the II segment behind a segmental portal branch.  In all, 6 passes were necessary since a further pass was required to correctly positionate the needle into the lesion at the II segment.The patient was discharged 24 hours later in good conditions.  Six days later the patient was admitted for scleral jaundice (total biliribunemia 4.0 mg/dl), melena and anemia (Hb 8.0 g/dl).  At gastroscopy no source of bleeding was found.  Abdominal US disclosed echogenic material in the gallbladder lumen (hemobilia) and a focal lesion with mixed echostructure in the III segment just along the needle track (hepatic hematoma).
