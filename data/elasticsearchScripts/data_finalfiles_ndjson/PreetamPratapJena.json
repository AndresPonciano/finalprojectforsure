{"title": "Estimating software development effort using UML use case point (UCP) method with a modified set of environmental factors\n", "abstract": " Software developers frequently depend on use cases to describe the business processes of object-oriented projects. Since use cases consists of the strategic goals and scenarios that provide value to a business domain, they can also provide insight to a projects complexity and required resources. The traditional models for cost estimation are no longer used effectively due rapid changes in technology. UML based Use case point is found to be robust one for the cost estimation having no influence of complexity of language, complexity of development platforms etc. Calculating the software development effort using Use Case Point method is found to be a suitable method. Many of the authors have done remarkable work on effort estimation using use case points by considering the external technical factors and environmental factors. In this paper the authors attempted to modify the environmental complexity factors to obtain precise and accurate result.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["427"]}
{"title": "Survey report on software cost estimation using use case point method\n", "abstract": " Software estimation is an important activity in software project management. Many software projects fail because of the inaccurate and untimely estimation of cost. Estimation in the early stages of the software life cycle became important though it helps to prevent or reduce project failures. Early estimation became so important while bidding on a project or signing the contract between the client and the developer. The early software estimation is carried out at a point when the details of the problem are not revealed completely. Now a days most of the software industries are focusing on Object-Oriented Software Development. Though the Use Case diagram is prepared after preparing a clear requirement specification, when all the artifacts about the system was clear enough, the UML Use Case Point method can be useful for early estimation. Many researchers and practitioners have done remarkable researches on Use Case Point Method and revealed several artifacts of use case in order to extend the well-known UCP method to support various range of software estimation. In our study, we have surveyed several papers on use case point method and highlighted the proposed metrics or factor by the researchers through this report.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["427"]}
