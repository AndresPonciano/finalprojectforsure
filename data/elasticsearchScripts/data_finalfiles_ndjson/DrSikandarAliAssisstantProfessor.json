Therefore, it is a challenging task to choose a suitable anomaly detection service (ADS) in real time. For accurate online anomalous data detection, this paper developed a service selection method to select and configure ADS at run-time. Initially, a time-series feature extractor (Tsfresh) and a genetic algorithm-based feature selection method are applied to swiftly extract dominant features which act as representation for the stream data patterns. Additionally, stream data and various efficient algorithms are collected as our historical data. A fast classification model based on XGBoost is trained to record stream data features to detect appropriate ADS dynamically at run-time. These methods help to choose suitable service and their respective configuration based on the patterns of stream data.

Though in Pakistan, most of the districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa produce onions, Malakand division lonely contributes 60% of the total onion production of the country. In onion farming, bolting is an insidious phenomenon that occurs in onion plants due to fluctuations in environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. Due to bolting, the flowering stem of an onion plant is produced before the crop is harvested, resulting in a poor-quality harvest and yield. Therefore, from a farmer\u2019s perspective, it is highly desirable to monitor and control the environmental factors to avoid bolting. In this paper, we propose and design a new prototype, namely, a smart farming monitoring system (SFMS) for bolting reduction, which is based on the generic three-layered IoT architecture. By using IoT (Internet of things) technology and careful remote monitoring, a more favorable environment can be provided to reduce and avoid onion bolting. To analyze the efficacy and performance of the proposed SFMS, a real test-bed implementation was carried out. The SFMS prototype was installed both in the open and in a greenhouse environment to monitor onion crops. Based on the data received via sensors, the percentage of onion bolting was recorded as 16.7% in the open environment while 3% in the closed environment. In the closed environment, optimal temperature, humidity, and light intensity were provided to the onion crops using the SFMS.

{"title": "Edge User Allocation in Overlap Areas for Mobile Edge Computing\n", "abstract": " The rapid development of mobile communication technology has promoted the emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC), which allows mobile users to transfer their computing tasks to nearby edge servers to reduce access latency. In the actual MEC environment, the signal coverage areas of edge servers usually overlap partially, and users in the overlapped areas can choose to connect to one of the edge servers that cover them. How to allocate these users will seriously affect MEC performance. To solve this issue, we focus on the overlapped area user allocation (OAUA) problem in the MEC environment and model it as a multi-objective optimization problem. The objective is to balance the workload among edge servers and minimize the access delay between users and edge servers. Pareto model is universal for solving multi-objective optimization problems. However, the traditional method has high\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1554"]}

{"title": "Secure patient authentication framework in the healthcare system using wireless medical sensor networks\n", "abstract": " Biosensor is a means to transmit some physical phenomena, like body temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood pressure. Such transmission is performed via Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN) while diagnosing patients remotely through Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT). The sensitive data transmitted through WMSN from IoMT over an insecure channel is vulnerable to several threats and needs proper attention to be secured from adversaries. In contrast to addressing the security of all associated entities involving patient monitoring in the healthcare system or ensuring the integrity, authorization, and nonrepudiation of information over the communication line, no one can guarantee its security without a robust authentication protocol. Therefore, we have proposed a lightweight and robust authentication scheme for the network-enabled healthcare devices (IoMT) that mitigate all the identified weaknesses posed in the recent literature. The proposed protocol\u2019s security has been analyzed formally using BAN logic and ProVerif2.02 and informally using pragmatic illustration. Simultaneously, at the end of the paper, the performance analysis result shows a delicate balance of security with performance that is often missing in the current protocols.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1554"]}
{"title": "Efficient Segmentation of Lymphoblast in Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia\n", "abstract": " Microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears and bone marrow is the preliminary step for the diagnosis of several life-threatening diseases. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common disease in children that also needs an early diagnosis for on-time treatment as it spreads rapidly in the blood and forms immature lymphocytes. This might cause death in some weeks if left untreated. Manual methods in clinical laboratory being applied for the diagnosis of these diseases are inefficient and expensive, and the results are less accurate. A computer-aided system is the need of the day in which the most important step is segmenting the region of interest in blood or bone marrow for the detection and cure of the diseases which is the most challenging task. This study aims to propose a simple threshold-based segmentation technique by processing the S component of the HSV color space to segment the lymphoblasts in the bone marrow images of ALL patients. The technique was applied to 230 RGB bone marrow images having all the three types of ALL, i.e., L1, L2, and L3 resulted in the overall accuracy of 96.8%.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1554"]}
{"title": "Lecture information service based on multiple features fusion\n", "abstract": " Information service is always a hot topic especially when the Web is accessible anywhere. In university, lecture information is very important for students and teachers who want to take part in academic meetings. Therefore, lecture news extraction is an important and imperative task. Many open information extraction methods have been proposed, but due to the high heterogeneity of websites, this task is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method based on fusing multiple features to locate lecture news on the university website. These features include the linked relationship between parent webpage and child webpages, the visual similarity, and the semantics of webpages. Additionally, this paper provides an information service based on a main content extraction algorithm for extracting the lecture information. Stable and invariant features enable the proposed method to adapt to various kinds of campus\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1554"]}
{"title": "An Empirical Investigation of the Challenges of Cloud-Based ERP Adoption in Pakistani SMEs\n", "abstract": " Cloud-based ERP solutions offer many benefits to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and help them to integrate their activities, such as improve communications and reduce operational and maintenance costs. Primarily, it was only adopted by large organizations, but now SMEs are also keen on adoption. However, the motivation regarding the adoption of these systems in SMEs is relatively low in developing countries. This fact urges us to investigate the challenges faced by Pakistani SMEs. A qualitative research approach along with unstructured interviews was conducted by means of face to face. Interview methods are used to extract understanding, opinions, and challenges faced by SMEs on their way to adopt the cloud-based ERP system. The data were collected from eight well-reputed organizations, directly involved in the adoption. The study found ten (10) themes that are reluctant to adopt cloud ERP among Pakistani SMEs. The main benefit of these themes is to provide results that can be easily accessible to enterprises who want to adopt a cloud-based ERP. This can also contribute to the lack of the literature of cloud ERP and delivers insight for future study by practitioners and researchers.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1554"]}
{"title": "From Digital Divide to Information Availability: A Wi-Fi-Based Novel Solution for Information Dissemination\n", "abstract": " Digital divide means unequal access to the people for information and communication technology (ICT) facilities. The developed countries are comparatively less digitally divided as compared to developing countries. This study focuses on District Chitral considering its geographical conditions and high mountainous topography which plays a significant role in its isolation. Aside from the digital divide, the situation in Chitral is even more severe in terms of the absence of basic ICT infrastructure and electricity in the schools. To address this issue, especially in female secondary and higher secondary schools, we designed a project to bridge the digital divide via Wireless Local Area Network on Raspberry Pi3 for balancing the ICT facilities in the targeted area. The Wi-Fi-Based Content Distributors (Wi-Fi-BCDs) were provided to bridge the digital divide in rural area schools of Chitral. The Wi-Fi-BCD is a solar-based system that is used to deliver quality educational contents directly to classroom, library, or other learning environments without electricity connection and Internet wire as these facilities are available by default in it. The close-ended questionnaire was adopted to collect data from the students, teachers, and headmistresses of girl secondary and higher secondary schools in Chitral. The procedure of validity, reliability, regression, correlation, and exploratory factor analysis was used to analyze the obtained data. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was modified and adopted to examine the effects of Wi-Fi-BCD for bridging the digital divide. The relationship of the modified TAM model was examined through regression and correlation to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1554"]}
{"title": "Crowd counting via Multi-Scale Adversarial Convolutional Neural Networks\n", "abstract": " The purpose of crowd counting is to estimate the number of pedestrians in crowd images. Crowd counting or density estimation is an extremely challenging task in computer vision, due to large scale variations and dense scene. Current methods solve these issues by compounding multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network with different receptive fields. In this paper, a novel end-to-end architecture based on Multi-Scale Adversarial Convolutional Neural Network (MSA-CNN) is proposed to generate crowd density and estimate the amount of crowd. Firstly, a multi-scale network is used to extract the globally relevant features in the crowd image, and then fractionally-strided convolutional layers are designed for up-sampling the output to recover the loss of crucial details caused by the earlier max pooling layers. An adversarial loss is directly employed to shrink the estimated value into the realistic subspace to reduce\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1554"]}

{"title": "A flame detection method based on novel gradient features\n", "abstract": " In this study, we present a novel approach to efficiently detect the flame in multiple scenes in an image. The method uses a set of parametric representation named as Gradient Features (GF), to learn the features of flame color changes in the image. Different from the traditional color features of the flame, GF represents the color changes in RGB channels for further consideration. In this study, support vector machine was applied to generate a set of candidate regions and the decision tree model was used to judge flame regions based on GF. Some exclusive experiments were conducted to verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method can accurately differentiate between yellow color light and sunrise scenes. A comparison with the state-of-the-art preceding methods showed that this method can utilize the symmetry of flame regions and achieve a better result.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1554"]}
{"title": "A case based method to predict optimal k value for k-NN algorithm\n", "abstract": " The k-nearest-neighbor classifier is a vital algorithm. In practice, the choice of k is decided by the cross-validation method. We propose a new method for neighborhood size selection based on the data set profile. The distribution of a data set and its intrinsic characteristics are the fundamental factors to the choice of k. A local complexity was computed for each example and a complexity profile was constructed by sorting these local complexity values which try to capture inner structure of a data set. After this, a feature vector was built by combing the local complexity profile and some statistic features of a data set. In addition, a history meta-data set was constructed by using the feature vector as attributes and the optimum k value of data set as the label, which was calculated by using ten cross-validation methods.
