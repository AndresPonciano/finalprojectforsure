Intuitively, there are two ways to address this problem: 1) modifying the Pareto dominance relation and 2) modifying the diversity maintenance mechanism in the algorithm.

{"title": "Evolutionary Many-objective Optimization: Pushing the Boundaries\n", "abstract": " Many-objective optimisation poses great challenges to evolutionary algorithms. To start with, the ineffectiveness of the Pareto dominance relation, which is the most important criterion in multi-objective optimisation, results in the underperformance of traditional Pareto-based algorithms. Also, the aggravation of the conflict between proximity and diversity, along with increasing time or space requirement as well as parameter sensitivity, has become key barriers to the design of effective many-objective optimisation algorithms. Furthermore, the infeasibility of solutions' direct observation can lead to serious difficulties in algorithms' performance investigation and comparison. In this thesis, we address these challenges, aiming to make evolutionary algorithms as effective in many-objective optimisation as in two- or three-objective optimisation. First, we significantly enhance Pareto-based algorithms to make them suitable for many-objective optimisation by placing individuals with poor proximity into crowded regions so that these individuals can have a better chance to be eliminated. Second, we propose a grid-based evolutionary algorithm which explores the potential of the grid to deal with many-objective optimisation problems. Third, we present a bi-goal evolution framework that converts many objectives of a given problem into two objectives regarding proximity and diversity, thus creating an optimisation problem in which the objectives are the goals of the search process itself. Fourth, we propose a comprehensive performance indicator to compare evolutionary algorithms in optimisation problems with various Pareto front shapes and any objective\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["552"]}
{"title": "Many-objective optimization based on information separation and neighbor punishment selection\n", "abstract": " Many-objective optimization refers to optimizing a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) where the number of objectives is more than 3. Most classical evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms use the Pareto dominance relation to guide the search, which usually perform poorly in the many-objective optimization scenario. This paper proposes an EMO algorithm based on information separation and neighbor punishment selection (ISNPS) to deal with many-objective optimization problems. ISNPS separates individual\u2019s behavior in the population into convergence information and distribution information by rotating the original coordinates in the objective space. Specifically, the proposed algorithm employs one coordinate to reflect individual\u2019s convergence and the remaining  coordinates to reflect individual\u2019s distribution, where m is the number of objectives in a given MOP.

{"title": "A hybrid development platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces an optimization template library (OTL), a cross-platform C++ template library for multiobjective optimization. OTL has an object-oriented architecture, which allows that different modules can be arbitrarily combined with each other. Moreover, the C++ template technique is used to increase the flexibility of OTL. Meanwhile, generic programming is widely used in OTL, and the generic algorithms can be used to process different data structures. However, compared with C++, the Python script is more suitable for building the experimental platform. To ensure that all attributes of the experimental results can be fully maintained, a database is used to store the experimental data. Moreover, batch experiments can be easily defined in a set of configuration files; thus, the experiments can be executed automatically without human intervention.

{"title": "Angle-based crowding degree estimation for many-objective optimization\n", "abstract": " \u00a9 2020, The Author(s). Many-objective optimization, which deals with an optimization problem with more than three objectives, poses a big challenge to various search techniques, including evolutionary algorithms. Recently, a meta-objective optimization approach (called bi-goal evolution, BiGE) which maps solutions from the original high-dimensional objective space into a bi-goal space of proximity and crowding degree has received increasing attention in the area. However, it has been found that BiGE tends to struggle on a class of many-objective problems where the search process involves dominance resistant solutions, namely, those solutions with an extremely poor value in at least one of the objectives but with (near) optimal values in some of the others. It is difficult for BiGE to get rid of dominance resistant solutions as they are Pareto nondominated and far away from the main population, thus always having a good crowding degree. In this paper, we propose an angle-based crowding degree estimation method for BiGE (denoted as aBiGE) to replace distance-based crowding degree estimation in BiGE. Experimental studies show the effectiveness of this replacement.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["552"]}
{"title": "Multiobjective optimization of the production process for ground granulated blast furnace slags\n", "abstract": " The production process of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) aims to produce products of the best grade and the highest yields. However, grade and yields are two competing objectives which can not be optimized at the same time by one single solution. Meanwhile, the production process is a multivariable strong coupling complicated nonlinear system. It is hard to establish the accurate mechanism model of this system. Considering above problems, we formulate the GGBS production process as an multiobjective optimization problem, introduce a least square support vector machine method based on particle swarm optimization to build the data-based system model and solve the corresponding multiobjective optimization problem by several multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms.

{"title": "A comparative study use of OTL for many-objective optimization\n", "abstract": " This study exhaustively compares the abilities to solve many-objective problems of eight representative algorithms from four different classes (ie, Pareto-, aggregation-, indicator-, and diversity-based EMO algorithms). The eight compared algorithms are tested on four types of well-defined continuous, discontinuous and combinatorial problems, through three performance metrics as well as a visual observation in the decision space. We can conclude from the experimental results that the performance of the eight algorithms differ not only on the dimensionality of the problems, but also on the shape and features of the Pareto front. From this it suggests an appropriate choice for researchers and practitioners when solving many-objective problems.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["552"]}
{"title": "Looking for novelty in search-based software product line testing\n", "abstract": " Testing software product lines (SPLs) is difficult due to a huge number of possible products to be tested. Recently, there has been a growing interest in similarity-based testing of SPLs, where similarity is used as a surrogate metric for the t-wise coverage. In this context, one of the primary goals is to sample, by optimizing similarity metrics using search-based algorithms, a small subset of test cases (ie, products) as dissimilar as possible, thus potentially making more t-wise combinations covered. Prior work has shown, by means of empirical studies, the great potential of current similarity-based testing approaches. However, the rationale of this testing technique deserves a more rigorous exploration. To this end, we perform correlation analyses to investigate how similarity metrics are correlated with the t-wise coverage. We find that similarity metrics generally have significantly positive correlations with the t-wise\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["552"]}

However, most of existing studies show a good distribution with a large computational load or a comparative bad distribution quickly. In this paper, a method for pruning a set of non-dominated solutions using a spanning tree is proposed. This approach defines a density estimation metric - spanning tree crowding distance (STCD). Moreover, information of degree of solution combined with STCD is employed to truncate the population. From an extensive comparative study with three other methods on a number of 2, 3 and 4 objective test problems, the proposed method indicates a good balance among uniformity, spread and execution time.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["552"]}

However, the majority of them suffer from system obesity and lack transparency on complex problems. In this paper, a novel classification approach with a multi-layered system structure self-organized from data is proposed. This approach is able to identify local peaks of multi-modal density derived from static data and filter out more representative ones at multiple levels of granularity acting as prototypes. These prototypes are then optimized to their locally optimal positions in the data space and arranged in layers with meaningful dense links in-between to form pyramidal hierarchies based on the respective levels of granularity accordingly.

Specifically, the network pruning and quantization space are explored and exploited by using architecture population evolution.

To deal with this problem, a common approach is to use multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to seek a set of tradeoff solutions between the three objectives. However, such a tradeoff set may contain a substantial proportion of solutions with very low reliability level, which consume lots of computational resources but may be valueless to the software project manager. In this article, a MOTRAP model with a prespecified reliability is first proposed.

These problems are defined as multiparty multiobjective optimization problems (MPMOPs). Although evolutionary multiobjective optimization has been widely studied for many years, little attention has been paid to multiparty multiobjective optimization in the field of evolutionary computation. In this paper, a class of MPMOPs, that is, MPMOPs having common Pareto optimal solutions, is addressed. A benchmark for MPMOPs, obtained by modifying an existing dynamic multiobjective optimization benchmark, is provided, and a multiparty multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to find the common Pareto optimal set is proposed.
