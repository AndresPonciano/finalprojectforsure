{"title": "What about sequential data mining techniques to identify linguistic patterns for stylistics?\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we study the use of data mining techniques for stylistic analysis, from a linguistic point of view, by considering emerging sequential patterns. First, we show that mining sequential patterns of words with gap constraints gives new relevant linguistic patterns with respect to patterns built on n-grams. Then, we investigate how sequential patterns of itemsets can provide more generic linguistic patterns. We validate our approach from a linguistic point of view by conducting experiments on three corpora of various types of French texts (Poetry, Letters, and Fiction). By considering more particularly poetic texts, we show that characteristic linguistic patterns can be identified using data mining techniques. We also discuss how to improve our proposed approach so that it can be used more efficiently for linguistic analyses.", "num_citations": "47\n", "authors": ["1845"]}
{"title": "Discovering linguistic patterns using sequence mining\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present a method based on data mining techniques to automatically discover linguistic patterns matching appositive qualifying phrases. We develop an algorithm mining sequential patterns made of itemsets with gap and linguistic constraints. The itemsets allow several kinds of information to be associated with one term. The advantage is the extraction of linguistic patterns with more expressiveness than the usual sequential patterns. In addition, the constraints enable to automatically prune irrelevant patterns. In order to manage the set of generated patterns, we propose a solution based on a partial ordering. A human user can thus easily validate them as relevant linguistic patterns. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach over two corpora coming from a newspaper.", "num_citations": "35\n", "authors": ["1845"]}

{"title": "Sequence mining under multiple constraints\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we address the problem of mining sequential patterns under multiple constraints. Unlike classical algorithms, our approach handles various types of constraints which are not only numeric but also symbolic and syntactic.

{"title": "Sequential patterns to discover and characterise biological relations\n", "abstract": " In this paper, we present a method to automatically detect and characterise interactions between genes in biomedical literature. Our approach is based on a combination of data mining techniques: frequent sequential patterns filtered by linguistic constraints and recursive mining. Unlike most Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, our approach does not use syntactic parsing to learn and apply linguistic rules. It does not require any resource except the training corpus to learn patterns.               The process is in two steps. First, frequent sequential patterns are extracted from the training corpus. Second, after validation of those patterns, they are applied on the application corpus to detect and characterise new interactions. An advantage of our method is that interactions can be enhanced with modalities and biological information.               We use two corpora containing only sentences with gene\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1845"]}
{"title": "Sequential pattern mining to discover relations between genes and rare diseases\n", "abstract": " Orphanet provides an international web-based knowledge portal for rare diseases including a collection of review articles. However, reviews and literature monitoring are manual. Thus, new documentation about a rare disease is a time-consuming process and automatically discovering knowledge from a large collection of texts is a crucial issue. This context represents a strong motivation to address the problem of extracting gene-rare diseases relationships from texts. In this paper, we tackle this issue with a cross-fertilization of information extraction and data mining techniques (sequential pattern mining under constraints). Experiments show the interest of the method for the documentation of rare diseases.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1845"]}
{"title": "Graph-FCA in practice\n", "abstract": " With the rise of the Semantic Web, more and more relational data are made available in the form of knowledge graphs (e.g., RDF, conceptual graphs). A challenge is to discover conceptual structures in those graphs, in the same way as Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) discovers conceptual structures in tables. Graph-FCA has been introduced in a previous work as an extension of FCA for such knowledge graphs. In this paper, algorithmic aspects and use cases are explored in order to study the feasibility and usefulness of G-FCA. We consider two use cases. The first one extracts linguistic structures from parse trees, comparing two graph models. The second one extracts workflow patterns from cooking recipes, highlighting the benefits of n-ary relationships and concepts.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1845"]}
{"title": "Formal concept analysis applied to fault localization\n", "abstract": " One time-consuming task in the development of software is debugging. Recent work in fault localization crosschecks traces of correct and failing execution traces, it implicitly searches for association rules which indicate that executing a line will most probably cause the whole execution to fail. This technique has some limitations: it assumes that an error has a single faulty statement origin, and that lines are independent. Our research hypothesis is that using association rules with more expressive premises, some limitations can be alleviated. The solution that we propose combines association rules and formal concept analysis. Our technique is already usable when the size of the execution traces is not too large. We conjecture that the technique can be used to analyze large executions, thanks to the information contained in the Abstract Syntax Tree.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1845"]}
{"title": "Graph-FCA: An extension of formal concept analysis to knowledge graphs\n", "abstract": " Knowledge graphs offer a versatile knowledge representation, and have been studied under different forms, such as conceptual graphs or RDF graphs in the Semantic Web. A challenge is to discover conceptual structures in those graphs, in the same way as Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) discovers conceptual structures in tables. FCA has been successful for analysing, mining, learning, and exploring tabular data, and our aim is to help transpose those results to graph-based data. Previous several FCA approaches have already addressed relational data, hence graphs, but with various limits. We propose Graph-FCA as an extension of FCA where a dataset is a hypergraph instead of a binary table. We show that it can be formalized simply by replacing objects by tuples of objects. This leads to the notion of \u201cn-ary concept\u201d, whose extent is an n-ary relation of objects, and whose intent is a \u201cprojected graph pattern\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1845"]}
{"title": "Sequential pattern mining for discovering gene interactions and their contextual information from biomedical texts\n", "abstract": " Discovering gene interactions and their characterizations from biological text collections is a crucial issue in bioinformatics. Indeed, text collections are large and it is very difficult for biologists to fully take benefit from this amount of knowledge. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been applied to extract background knowledge from biomedical texts. Some of existing NLP approaches are based on handcrafted rules and thus are time consuming and often devoted to a specific corpus. Machine learning based NLP methods, give good results but generate outcomes that are not really understandable by a user. We take advantage of an hybridization of data mining and natural language processing to propose an original symbolic method to automatically produce patterns conveying gene interactions and their characterizations. Therefore, our method not only allows gene interactions but also semantics\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1845"]}

{"title": "Mining periodic patterns with a MDL criterion\n", "abstract": " The quantity of event logs available is increasing rapidly, be they produced by industrial processes, computing systems, or life tracking, for instance. It is thus important to design effective ways to uncover the information they contain. Because event logs often record repetitive phenomena, mining periodic patterns is especially relevant when considering such data. Indeed, capturing such regularities is instrumental in providing condensed representations of the event sequences.                 We present an approach for mining periodic patterns from event logs while relying on a Minimum Description Length (MDL) criterion to evaluate candidate patterns. Our goal is to extract a set of patterns that suitably characterises the periodic structure present in the data. We evaluate the interest of our approach on several real-world event log datasets.

{"title": "Graphmdl: Graph pattern selection based on minimum description length\n", "abstract": " Many graph pattern mining algorithms have been designed to identify recurring structures in graphs. The main drawback of these approaches is that they often extract too many patterns for human analysis. Recently, pattern mining methods using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle have been proposed to select a characteristic subset of patterns from transactional, sequential and relational data. In this paper, we propose an MDL-based approach for selecting a characteristic subset of patterns on labeled graphs. A key notion in this paper is the introduction of ports to encode connections between pattern occurrences without any loss of information. Experiments show that the number of patterns is drastically reduced. The selected patterns have complex shapes and are representative of the data.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1845"]}
