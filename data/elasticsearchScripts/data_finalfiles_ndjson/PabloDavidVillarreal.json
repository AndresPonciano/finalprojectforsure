{"title": "Extending BPMN 2.0: method and tool support\n", "abstract": " There are two major pitfalls in the development of extensions to the BPMN 2.0 metamodel. First, there is a lack of methodological guides considering the extensibility approach supported by the extension mechanism of the language. Second, BPMN does not provide any graphical notation for the representation of extensions. This work proposes a method based on Model-Driven Architecture for the development of extensions to the BPMN 2.0 metamodel. It enables the conceptual modeling of extensions by using UML, their graphical representation in terms of the BPMN extension mechanism, and their transformation into XML Schema documents that can be processed by BPMN tools.

{"title": "M\u00e9todo para el modelado y especificaci\u00f3n de procesos de negocio colaborativos\n", "abstract": " El modelado y la especificaci\u00f3n de los procesos de negocio colaborativos constituyen un desaf\u00edo importante para que las empresas puedan establecer colaboraciones Business-to-Business. El objetivo de esta tesis es definir y proponer un m\u00e9todo robusto y sistem\u00e1tico que de soporte al desarrollo de procesos colaborativos, desde el modelado de los mismos, hasta la especificaci\u00f3n de dichos procesos y de las interfaces de las empresas que conforman el sistema de informaci\u00f3n Business-toBusiness, en una tecnolog\u00eda particular. El m\u00e9todo est\u00e1 basado en la filosof\u00eda del desarrollo conducido por modelos y fundamentalmente, en los principios y gu\u00edas de la Arquitectura Conducida por Modelos. Como parte de este m\u00e9todo, se propone el lenguaje de modelado UP-ColBPIP, para dar soporte al an\u00e1lisis y dise\u00f1o de los procesos colaborativos. El lenguaje est\u00e1 basado en el concepto de protocolos de interacci\u00f3n para definir procesos colaborativos independientes de la tecnolog\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s, se propone un m\u00e9todo y una herramienta para definir y ejecutar transformaciones de modelos de procesos colaborativos en especificaciones basadas en un est\u00e1ndar Business-toBusiness. Finalmente, se definen las transformaciones que posibilitan generar, a partir de modelos definidos con UP-ColBPIP, soluciones tecnolog\u00edas con dos tipos diferentes de est\u00e1ndares Business-to-Business.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["618"]}
