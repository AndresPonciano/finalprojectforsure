{"title": "A statistical examination of the evolution and properties of libre software\n", "abstract": " How and why does software evolve? This question has been under study since almost 40 years ago, and it is still a subject of controversy. In the seventies, Meir M. Lehman formulated the laws of software evolution, a first attempt to characterize the dynamics of the evolution of software. With the raise of the libre (free / open source) software development phenomenon, some cases that do not fulfill those laws have appeared. Are Lehman's laws valid in the case of libre software development? Is it possible to design an universal theory for software evolution? And if it is, how? This thesis is a large-scale empirical and statistical approach to analyze the properties and evolution of libre software, using publicly available data sources, hence enabling repeatability of the results and third parties verification, fundamental aspects of any empirical study. The main results are that a small subset of basic size metrics are enough to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "39\n", "authors": ["213"]}
{"title": "The influence of economic incentives linked to road safety indicators on accidents: The case of toll concessions in Spain\n", "abstract": " The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether the incentives incorporated in toll highway concession contracts in order to encourage private operators to adopt measures to reduce accidents are actually effective at improving safety. To this end, we implemented negative binomial regression models using information about highway characteristics and accident data from toll highway concessions in Spain from 2007 to 2009. Our results show that even though road safety is highly influenced by variables that are not managed by the contractor, such as the annual average daily traffic (AADT), the percentage of heavy vehicles on the highway, number of lanes, number of intersections and average speed; the implementation of these incentives has a positive influence on the reduction of accidents and injuries. Consequently, this measure seems to be an effective way of improving safety performance in road networks.", "num_citations": "34\n", "authors": ["213"]}
