At the same time, the boundaries of municipal organizational units, such as neighborhoods and districts, are largely statically defined by the city government and do not always reflect the character of life in these ar-eas. To address both difficulties, we introduce a clustering model and research methodology for studying the structure and composition of a city based on the social media its res-idents generate. We use data from approximately 18 million check-ins collected from users of a location-based online so-cial network. The resulting clusters, which we call Livehoods, are representations of the dynamic urban areas that comprise the city. We take an interdisciplinary approach to validating these clusters, interviewing 27 residents of Pittsburgh, PA, to see how their perceptions of the city project onto our findings there. Our results provide strong support for the discovered clusters, showing how Livehoods reveal the distinctly charac-terized areas of the city and the forces that shape them.", "num_citations": "760\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

We developed an automated test bed for testing antiphishing tools. We used 200 verified phishing URLs from two sources and 516 legitimate URLs to test the effectiveness of 10 popular anti-phishing tools. Only one tool was able to consistently identify more than 90% of phishing URLs correctly; however, it also incorrectly identified 42% of legitimate URLs as phish. The performance of the other tools varied considerably depending on the source of the phishing URLs. Of these remaining tools, only one correctly identified over 60% of phishing URLs from both sources. Performance also changed significantly depending on the freshness of the phishing URLs tested. Thus we demonstrate that the source of phishing URLs and the freshness of the URLs tested can significantly impact the results of anti-phishing tool testing.

As a proof of concept, we have developed a prototype context-aware messaging application in the firefighting domain. We have evaluated this application with firefighters and they have found it to be useful for improving many aspects of their current work practices.", "num_citations": "204\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

Prior studies tested users immediately after training and demonstrated that embedded training improved users' ability to identify phishing emails and websites. In the present study, we tested users to determine how well they retained knowledge gained through embedded training and how well they transferred this knowledge to identify other types of phishing emails.

We provide a probabilistic framework for dynamically selecting an active authentication scheme that satisfies a specified security requirement given passive factors. We also present the results of three user studies evaluating the feasibility and users' receptiveness of our concept.

We extract multiple kinds of features from decompiled code, focusing on app-specific features and text-based features. These features are then used to train a machine learning classifier. We have evaluated our approach in the context of two sensitive permissions, namely ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION and READ_CONTACT_LIST, and achieved an accuracy of about 85% and 94% respectively in inferring purposes. We have also found that text-based features alone are highly effective in inferring purposes.", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

Here, we analyzed how three Facebook security features' Login Approvals, Login Notifications, and Trusted Contacts-diffused through the social networks of 1.5 million people. Our results suggest that social influence affects one's likelihood to adopt a security feature, but its effect varies based on the observability of the feature, the current feature adoption rate among a potential adopter's friends, and the number of distinct social circles from which those feature-adopting friends originate. Curiously, there may be a threshold higher than which having more security feature adopting friends predicts for higher adoption likelihood, but below which having more feature-adopting friends predicts for lower adoption likelihood.

{"title": "Does this App Really Need My Location? Context-Aware Privacy Management for Smartphones\n", "abstract": " The enormous popularity of smartphones, their rich sensing capabilities, and the data they have about their users have lead to millions of apps being developed and used. However, these capabilities have also led to numerous privacy concerns. Platform manufacturers, as well as researchers, have proposed numerous ways of mitigating these concerns, primarily by providing fine-grained visibility and privacy controls to the user on a per-app basis. In this paper, we show that this per-app permission approach is suboptimal for many apps, primarily because most data accesses occur due to a small set of popular third-party libraries which are common across multiple apps. To address this problem, we present the design and implementation of ProtectMyPrivacy (PmP) for Android, which can detect critical contextual information at runtime when privacy-sensitive data accesses occur. In particular, PmP infers the purpose\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

Through an analysis of public data and two surveys, we investigate why people geotag their photos, tweets, and other non-location-based social media. We found that their reasons are similar to those in location-based social networks. We also found several surprises due to the different nature of these platforms and the changes since location-based social networks were introduced.

However, their effectiveness is heavily dependent on their installation rate, which may be influenced by people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential privacy risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user identity and location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, ). The six app designs covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals. Contrary to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of people in our sample preferred to install apps that use a centralized server for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow a centralized authority to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users to infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations in public places to show hotspots of infection. Our results suggest that apps using a centralized architecture with strong security protection to do basic contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the U.S.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

Blau defines social structure via social \u201cparameters\u201d (constraints). Actors that are closer together (more homogenous) in this social parameter space are more likely to interact. One of Blau\u2019s most important hypotheses resulting from this work was that the consolidation of parameters could lead to isolated social groups. For example, the consolidation of race and income might lead to segregation. In the present work, we use Foursquare data from New York City to explore evidence of homogeneity along certain social parameters and consolidation that breeds social isolation in communities of locations checked in to by similar users. More specifically, we first test the extent to which communities detected via Latent Dirichlet Allocation are homogenous across a set of four social constraints\u2014racial homophily, income\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

{"title": "Modeling content from human-verified blacklists for accurate zero-hour phish detection\n", "abstract": " Phishing attacks are a significant security threat to users of the Internet, causing tremendous economic loss every year. Past work in academia has not been adopted by industry in part due to concerns about liability over false positives. However, blacklist-based methods heavily used in industry are slow in responding to new phish attacks, and tend to be easily overwhelmed by phishing techniques such as fast-flux and the proliferation of toolkits. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of two blacklist-enhanced content-based algorithms. The key insight behind our algorithms is to leverage existing human-verified whitelists and blacklists, and relax them via probabilistic methods to attain high true positive rates while maintaining extremely low false positive rates. Comprehensive experiments over a diverse spectrum of data sources show that our approach currently achieves a false positive rate of 0.0434 with a true positive rate of 87.42. Our algorithms are able to adapt quickly to new phishing attacks by incremental retraining, and present a new framework that will generalize to evolving attacks.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

{"title": "Integrating Context Services Through Automatic Path Creation\n", "abstract": " We believe that a middleware service infrastructure can greatly simplify the tasks of creating context-aware applications and maintaining the suite of sensors that supports these applications. By providing a uniform layer of abstraction and a common programming model, such an infrastructure would provide support for context-aware applications in a platform neutral manner. Furthermore, such an infrastructure would be \u201calways on,\u201d allowing sensors and devices to be deployed incrementally without having to update every application or having to restart the entire system. The particulars of this infrastructure approach are detailed elsewhere [REF].One of the key services in this infrastructure would be automatic path creation, a way of flexibly composing existing services to create new functionality. Automatic path creation has been previously used for data format and protocol interoperability (for example,[1] and [2]), but our position is that it can also be used to facilitate the creation of context services. As an example, suppose we have three services, one that converts GPS location to ZIP code information (denoted GPS\u2192 ZIP), another that uses ZIP codes to retrieve current weather conditions in that area (ZIP\u2192 Weather), and another that uses ZIP codes to find local movie theaters (ZIP\u2192 Movie Theaters). Individually, each of these services are not very interesting; however, they can be chained together into paths to form more interesting services, such as using GPS to retrieve weather conditions (chaining GPS\u2192 ZIP and ZIP\u2192 Weather together).", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

{"title": "An Anonymous and Privacy-Sensitive Approach to Collecting Sensed Data in Location-Based Applications\n", "abstract": " The emergence of location-based computing promises new and compelling applications, but raises very real privacy risks. Existing approaches to privacy generally treat people as the entity of interest, often using a fidelity tradeoff to manage the costs and benefits of revealing a person\u2019s location. However, these approaches cannot be applied in some applications, as a reduction in precision can render location information useless. This is true of a category of applications that use location data collected from multiple people to infer such information as whether there is a traffic jam on a bridge, whether there are seats available in a nearby coffee shop, when the next bus will arrive, or if a particular conference room is currently empty. We present hitchhiking, a new approach that treats locations as the primary entity of interest. Hitchhiking removes the fidelity tradeoff by preserving the anonymity of reports without reducing the precision of location disclosures. We can therefore support the full functionality of an interesting class of location-based applications without introducing the privacy concerns that would otherwise arise.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

Assigning them provably strong secrets is one solution, and prior work has shown that people can learn these assigned secrets through rote learning, though learning the secrets takes some time and they are quickly forgotten after two weeks of disuse. To improve upon the learning speed and long-term recall of strong, assigned secrets, we introduce, implement and evaluate a set of treatments, inspired by mnemonic devices and real-time feedback tutoring systems, to assist people in learning and remembering their assigned secrets. We encoded strong secrets as a set of six words randomly chosen from a corpus of 676 (\u223c 56 bits of entropy). In a randomized between-subjects experiment, our story mnemonic, in which participants wrote two sentences linking their assigned secret words together in a narrative, performed best. Participants who used the story mnemonic required significantly fewer training sessions (7.5 versus 12 sessions) and had higher two-week recall when allowing for minor errors (84% vs. 65%) than the rote control from prior work. Additionally, 92% of those who could not recall their full secrets after two weeks were able to recover their secret once they saw their mnemonic hints with the secret words elided. In contrast, our other treatments did not perform as well\u2013providing few, if any, notable improvements over the rote control. Finally, in an exit survey, a large majority of our participants reported that our treatments were quick, helpful\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1171"]}
{"title": "Examining visual-spatial paths for mobile authentication\n", "abstract": " Inspired by people\u2019s strong memory for visual-spatial paths (eg, commuting paths), we present in this paper an introductory exploration of the use of these paths for memorable, strong mobile authentication. In a preliminary study, we evaluated several low-fidelity representations for encoding relatively strong (~ 20 bit) secrets as visual-spatial paths: a 2D birds-eye view, a 3D third-person view, and 3D immersed view. We found that the 3D immersed view worked best for memorability, and used this initial study to inspire the design for a novel mobile authentication application: the Memory Palace. We ran a within-subjects experiment to evaluate our Memory Palace authentication concept against Android\u2019s 9-dot Patternlock along two dimensions: memorability and resilience to shoulder surfing. Results from our experiment suggest people have significantly higher memorability for visual-spatial secrets encoded in the Memory Palace which were also significantly more resilient against shoulder surfing. We conclude with directions for further work: specifically, creating sharable paths for more socially compatible authentication and segmenting secret paths for simple, non-binary access control.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1171"]}

In previous lab and real-world experiments, we validated the effectiveness of this approach. Here, we extend our previous work with a 515-participant, real-world study in which we focus on long-term retention and the effect of two training messages. We also investigate demographic factors that influence training and general phishing susceptibility. Results of this study show that (1) users trained with PhishGuru retain knowledge even after 28 days; (2) adding a second training message to reinforce the original training decreases the likelihood of people giving information to phishing websites; and (3) training does not decrease users\u2019 willingness to click on links in legitimate messages. We found no significant difference between males and females in the tendency to fall for phishing emails both before and after the training. We found that participants in the 18-25 age group were consistently more vulnerable to phishing attacks on all days of the study than older participants.

Forrester Research estimates that in 1999 business-to-consumer (B2C) eCommerce will reach $20 billion and business-to-business (B2B) eCommerce will reach $109 billion. However, as interaction designers and HCI researchers, we all know that usability can have a sharp impact on the user experience, which can directly affect a business' bottom line. A recent report released by Creative Good [1] estimates that $6 billion was lost due to poor web experiences in 1999. A clear example of the importance of usability was when IBM experienced a 400% increase in sales after redesigning their web site with usability in mind [2]. Combined with the fact that there are only around 250 million web users today [3] out of over 6 billion people, ease-of-use is critically important as more and more novices get on the web.Although there is certainly a lot of hype surrounding eCommerce, none of the reports and predictions answer a very simple question: who is going to build all of this in the future? Certainly, there are many HTML authors who can create simple web sites, and there are also many tools out there to help manage web page layout.
