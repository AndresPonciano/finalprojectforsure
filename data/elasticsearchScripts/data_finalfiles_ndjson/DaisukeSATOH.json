The PCN working group of the IETF discusses the use of PCN to implement admission control (AC) and flow termination (FT) for prioritized realtime traffic in a DiffServ domain. Admission control (AC) is a well-known flow control function that blocks admission requests of new flows when they need to be carried over a link whose admitted PCN rate already exceeds an admissible rate. Flow termination (FT) is a new flow control function that terminates some already admitted flows when they are carried over a link whose admitted PCN rate exceeds a supportable rate. The latter condition can occur in spite of AC, e.g., when traffic is rerouted due to network failures. This survey gives an introduction to PCN and is a primer for this new technology.

Moreover, we need to reflect the relative importance of each criterion when evaluating the network topology. However, ordinary methods of network topology design consider only a single criterion. In this paper, we apply AHP (analytic hierarchy process), which has been widely used when making a rational decision with multiple criteria, to network topology design. AHP enables us to reflect the relative importance of each criterion on the results. In network topology design, we need to consider a huge number of candidates, and the differences in the weights among candidates are small.

As a result, telephone networks become congested, making it difficult for people to contact each other. This congestion continues in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster. The sooner the congestion is eased, the sooner and easier people can contact each other. We accomplish this by reducing communication demand without directly restricting call duration.

Discrete integrable systems are expected to be applied to engineering. Forecasting is important in engineering. The making of decisions in various industries is heavily reliant on forecasting. Forecasting is the dominant factor in decisions on how many finished products should bemade, how much stock should be prepared and so on. In the past there has been a tendency for forecasts to be unduly optimistic. This has produced some serious problems. Therefore, the accuracy of forecasting is of great importance. Growth curve models are used for forecasting in many fields, eg, ecology [3, 25, 35], agriculture [26], life sciences [13], marketing [1, 12], and software reliability growth models (SRGMs)[14, 22, 36]. To forecast the ceiling, we estimateparameters of the differential equation which provides the growth curve model. The differential equations which are used gen-erally have exact solutions. In the conventional method, thedifferential equation\u2019s parameters are estimated by using an ordinary forward or central difference equation as its approximation.
