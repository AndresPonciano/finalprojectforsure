However, many of these applications fail to achieve the desired benefits of gamification, mainly because of a poor design.ObjectiveThis paper explores the conceptualization, implementation and monitoring phases of meaningful gamification strategies and proposes a solution for strategy experts that hides the implementation details and helps them focus only on what is crucial for the success of the strategy. The solution makes use of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology.MethodAn easy-to-use graphical editor is used to provide the high-level models that represent the design of the gamification strategy and its deployment and monitoring.

In this paper, we discuss the need of developing tools to teach in the scope of Software Project Management, and how we can achieve that learners test their knowledge and cover the needed educational objectives, in a risk-free environment through a serious game. Hence, we propose ProDec, a simulation-based serious game to teach and assess in software project management. This tool is an attempt to surpass the limitations found in similar proposals. The paper also maps the stages of the game lifecycle to the levels of Bloom\u2019s taxonomy to show how the game helps to achieve different levels of educational objectives.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["386"]}

Project Decision (ProDec) is a simulationbased serious game created with the intention to train and assess students in software project management. The main objective is to take advantage of the engaging nature of games to place the learners in a virtual organization where they can manage software projects and solve real-life problems in a risk-free environment. For the trainer, ProDec is a support tool for training in matters such as leadership, task and team management, project monitoring and control, and risk management. It also helps the trainer assess the skills that the learners develop by playing the game. After any game play, ProDec offers a complete report including the logs representing every decision the players made and the result of applying the assessment criteria provided by the trainer at the beginning of the game play.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["386"]}

However, a question that arises is to which regard the expected benefits of these games are real. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyse the benefits of digital and non-digital games used for SPM education in order to evaluate their quality in terms of player experience and perceived learning adopting the MEEGA+ evaluation model. The analysis is based on data collected from 27 case studies, evaluating 11 different SPM games, involving a population of 562 students. Results provide evidence that both digital and non-digital games contribute positively to the students\u2019 perceived learning, as well as to social interaction, being considered relevant to students\u2019 learning, and promoting fun.
