{"title": "A rationale-based architecture model for design traceability and reasoning\n", "abstract": " Large systems often have a long life-span and comprise many intricately related elements. The verification and maintenance of these systems require a good understanding of their architecture design. Design rationale can support such understanding but it is often undocumented or unstructured. The absence of design rationale makes it much more difficult to detect inconsistencies, omissions and conflicts in an architecture design. We address these issues by introducing a rationale-based architecture model that incorporates design rationale, design objects and their relationships. This model provides reasoning support to explain why design objects exist and what assumptions and constraints they depend on. Based on this model, we apply traceability techniques for change impact analysis and root-cause analysis, thereby allowing software architects to better understand and reason about an architecture design\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "339\n", "authors": ["648"]}

We have previously introduced the ROAD framework for creating flexible and adaptive software structures. This framework is built on a distinction between functional and management roles. Management roles participate in contracts that regulate the global-flow of control through a structure of objects and roles. This paper shows how these operational-management contracts can be defined. Such contracts specify the permissible interactions between objects playing functional roles within an organisational structure.

In this paper, we present an approach to discovering individualized behavior rules for mobile users from their phone call records, based on the temporal context in which a user accepts, rejects or misses a call. One of the determinants of an individual's phone behavior is the various activities undertaken at various times of a day and days of the week. In many cases, such behavior will follow temporal patterns. Currently, researchers modeling user behavior using temporal context statically segment time into arbitrary categories (e.g., morning, evening) or periods (e.g., 1 hour). However, such time categorization does not necessarily map to the patterns of individual user activity and subsequent behavior. Therefore, we propose a behavior-oriented time segmentation (BOTS) technique that dynamically identifies\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["648"]}

The primary source of information is the user (organisation). However it is often the case that users inadequately elicit software requirements and in a form inappropriate to the software developers. Software requirements have to be established by an iterative refinement process of elicitation, analysis, modelling and representation.An important but intractable issue is that of knowledge representation and management, and specially domain knowledge. Domain knowledge forms the basis for establishing a common universe of discourse (UoD) between users and analysts, for mutual understanding, reference and validation of requirements.

As such, it is important to estimate the criticalities of the execution paths and the component services, i.e., the probabilities that they are critical, to decide which parts of the system to monitor.

On the other hand, the software engineers are more interested in the compositional impact and conformity of the security properties designed and implemented by the security experts. This paper identifies a third level of abstraction: security from the end-users' perspective. This paper argues that the end-users of the system should know the specific security objectives actually achieved at the system-level. This paper makes the following three specific contributions in this regard: (i) a need for a separate view of security\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["648"]}
{"title": "On the autonomy of software entities and modes of organisation\n", "abstract": " As software becomes more complex and needs to operate in more open environments, the relationships between the encapsulated entities that constitute the software can become nondeterministic. In a number of branches of computer science, organisational mechanisms and structures have been seen as a way to coordinate the complex behaviour between software entities. In particular, organisational abstractions have been viewed as a way of handling complexity in various multi-agent system methodologies, and various object-oriented and role modelling methodologies that focus on collaborations. Organisational mechanisms and structures need to be appropriate to the types of software entity being organised. We define five levels of autonomy and discuss the relationship of these levels to different mechanisms and modes of software organisation. This paper proposes that the degree of the autonomy and capability of the entities determines what organisational abstractions are appropriate. In particular, it is posited that organisation structures based on roles with differentiated autonomy are necessary in complex open systems.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["648"]}

We argue that security of a software component does not exist in isolation but rather have strong binding with a use context such as whether a system is secure or not with respect to a specific threat. The notion of scenarios has led us to adopt a context-based security characterisation model of software components. We use message communication protocols and architectural description of components' functionality as valuable tools to describe a particular scenario of a composed system. This approach provides us with the means to identify the required security properties as well as ensured security properties of participating components in a compositional contract. The characterisation model is based on a simple structure that is used to capture the security properties of interacting components in a particular'scenario'. The proposed structure consists of a predicate and four distinctive elements. The elements comprise identities of contracting components, operations to be performed in a compositional contract, required and ensured security attributes, and the data to be used in the particular compositional contract.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["648"]}

Existing methods assume all queries should be classified to the target domain, and thus they are limited when interpreting queries from different domains in real query logs. To address the problem, we introduce a human-machine hybrid method by utilizing crowdsourcing platforms. Our method selects a small number of query terms and asks the crowdsourcing workers to interpret them, and then infers the interpretations based on the crowdsourcing results. To improve the performance, we propose an iterative probabilistic inference method based on a similarity graph of query terms, and select the most useful query terms for crowdsourcing by considering their domain-relevance and gained benefit.

The consideration of adaptability in designing such systems is necessary in this unstable and volatile environment. There have been intensive efforts on solutions to make service compositions adaptable, but little attention is given to the evaluation of such adaptability. This paper proposes a set of metrics to quantify the adaptability of service compositions that are specified from the adaptive WS-BPEL-based frameworks.

As such, system security features are not systematically designed into the system, and consequently the system has inherent security \"holes\". Therefore, there is a strong need for a systematic engineering approach to developing secure and robust systems, especially distributed systems, by considering functional and security requirements at the same time.

This requires that a composite application have the ability to adaptively reconfigure itself to continuously satisfy the system requirements.

In this paper we introduce an organisation-oriented, application-centric service composition framework that aims to achieve adaptive application behaviour from non-deterministic and unreliable services. The responsibility for coordinating and managing service interactions resides with a coordination/management layer of the application itself. This layer involves two types of essential elements: service contracts and service organisers. The service contracts define and regulate the relationships between the services in a composition. The service organisers control the bindings between service types and individual services, and can create and revoke contracts between services within the composition in order to adaptively reconfigure the application in response to changing conditions. An adaptive service composition can be formed by connecting and configuring services through dynamically formulated contracts, under the control and management of service organisers.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["648"]}

Developing a software system that evolves at runtime is still a difficult task. Issues like (a) lack of an approach to develop a system that has the ability to be changed at runtime and (b) lack of a mechanism to enable runtime evolution of a system in response to unanticipated changes need to be solved for easy and effective development and evolution of a software system. In this report, we introduce a novel approach to ease the task of developing and evolving context-aware systems. Our approach supports system\u2019s modelling and its implementations generation from their models. These generated implementations have the ability to be evolved, where each generated system element is engineered with the ability to be added, removed, or modified at runtime. To enable system\u2019s runtime evolution, we have developed a tool that enables the software engineer to load a running system model, change this model to take into account the unanticipated changes, and then reflect the required changes to the running system automatically. To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we used it to develop and evolve a context-aware route planner. We also assessed the performance of our approach through measuring the overhead caused by performing the system evolution at runtime.

To develop complex functionalities, very often we need to compose single web services into composite web services. Service composition is thus becoming a dominant method for developing Web service applications.When designing a service composition, it is important to ensure that the composition conforms to the requirements. Most of the existing conformance checking methods require the users to be able to write the requirement specifications in formalisms like temporal logics, etc. These methods are thus inaccessible to practitioners who often do not have a strong mathematical background. In addition, whenever the designated service composition does not conform to the set requirements, post development error corrections can be time consuming and troublesome.

{"title": "Pervasive Social Computing: Socially-Aware Pervasive Systems and Mobile Applications\n", "abstract": " This book presents a review of traditional context-aware computing research, identifies its limitations in developing social context-aware pervasive systems, and introduces a new technology framework to address these limitations. Thus, this book provides a good reference for developments in context-aware computing and pervasive social computing. It examines the emerging area of pervasive social computing, which is a novel collective paradigm derived from pervasive computing, social media, social networking, social signal processing and multimodal human-computer interaction. This book offers a novel approach to model, represent, reason about and manage different types of social context. It shows how users\u2019 social context information can be acquired from different online social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google Calendar. It further presents the use of social context information in developing innovative smart mobile applications to assist users in their daily life. The mix of both theoretical and applied research results makes this book attractive to a variety of readers from both academia and industry. This book provides a new platform for implementing different types of socially-aware mobile applications. The platform hides the complexity of managing social context, and thus provides essential support to application developers for the development of socially-aware applications. The book contains detailed descriptions of how the underlying platform has been implemented using available technologies such as ontology and rule engines, and how this platform can be used to develop socially-aware mobile applications\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}
{"title": "Enterprise software service emulation: constructing large-scale testbeds\n", "abstract": " Constructing testbeds for systems which are interconnected with large networks of other software services is a challenging task. It is particularly difficult to create testbeds facilitating evaluation of the non-functional qualities of a system, such as scalability, that can be expected in production deployments. Software service emulation is an approach for creating such testbeds where service behaviour is defined by emulate-able models executed in an emulation runtime environment. We present (i) a meta-modelling framework supporting emulate-able service modelling (including messages, protocol, behaviour and states), and (ii) Kaluta, an emulation environment able to concurrently execute large numbers (thousands) of service models, providing a testbed which mimics the behaviour and characteristics of large networks of interconnected software services. Experiments show that Kaluta can emulate 10,000 servers\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}
{"title": "Can control-component libraries reduce the costs of developing control engineering-based self-adaptive systems?\n", "abstract": " Many approaches have been proposed to develop self-adaptive software systems based on control engineering methods in recent years. However, these research works only evaluate the self-adaptive capabilities of the proposed control solution, but no evaluation is performed to quantify the costs of implementing such a control solution. This paper provides results of an empirical study, conducted to quantify the implementation, testing and knowledge requirement costs of building a self-adaptive software system using control engineering methods. Our objective is to investigate, whether these costs can be significantly reduced if a library of prepackaged control components is available to software engineers. The findings of the study indicate that the aforementioned costs can be significantly reduced when supporting libraries are available.

{"title": "Clinical significance of RECK and MMP-9 expression in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma\n", "abstract": " Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is recognized for its ability to promote tumor invasion and metastasis. However, its role and that of a novel regulator of MMP-9, reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK), have not been explored in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We investigated expression of MMP-9 and RECK in SCC to determine the clinical significance of their expression and potential uses for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze expression in 36 SCC and 13 healthy skin samples collected at our hospital. RECK expression was detected in 33.3% of SCC samples, significantly fewer than for control samples (84.6%, P< 0.05). In contrast, MMP-9 was expressed in 77.8% of SCC samples, significantly more than in control samples (30.8%, P< 0.05). RECK and MMP-9 expression in SCC samples were negatively correlated (r=-0.406, P< 0.05). Furthermore, negative RECK and positive MMP-9 expression in SCC tissues were correlated with differentiation degree and lymph node metastasis (P< 0.05) but not with gender or age. Thus, low/absent expression of RECK and increased expression of MMP-9 correspond to increased disease severity. These proteins may play opposing roles in pathogenesis of SCC and may serve as future diagnostic or prognostic markers. Therefore RECK should be further investigated for therapeutic potential as an MMP-9 inhibitor.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}
{"title": "Scenario-driven Development of Context-aware Adaptive Software Systems\n", "abstract": " Context-awareness and adaptability are highly desirable features for software systems that operate in dynamic environments. In recent years, a number of approaches have been proposed to support the development of such systems. However, elicitation of a context-aware adaptive system requirements and synthesis of the system model from its requirements are still major challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to scenario-driven development of context-aware adaptive systems. Our approach enables the elicitation of the system requirements as a set of scenarios. In particular, we differentiate functional scenarios from adaptation scenarios. The functional scenarios capture the system\u2019s functionality while taking the context information into account to operate effectively. The adaptation scenarios represent the system\u2019s runtime adaptation to cope with the context changes. We also support synthesis of the system model from its scenarios. This model is then completed by the software engineer to add elements that are related to the system\u2019s solution space and cannot be synthesised from the scenarios directly. We have developed a tool that enables the system\u2019s implementations generation from their models. A case study of developing a context-aware travel guide system is also presented to demonstrate the viability of our approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}

Besides, construction and retrofit intensity and investment scale for distribution network also show a large rise. Thus, the problem, which refers to realizing maximum economic returns, is urgently needed to be solved. A construction and retrofit strategy based on a step investment was put forward, types of main problems for 110 (35) kV substations and 10kV lines were analyzed and summed up. And combining with problem severity, the concepts of desirability and priority was also proposed, as well as the corresponding calculation methods for construction and retrofit. According to the desirability level, three combination schemes were established, which are fit for large, medium and low investment separately. Also step investment intervals for each scheme could be obtained. The rationality and validity of this method was verified by an example analysis of construction and retrofit scheme. Moreover, the results could be the scientific guideline to the future construction and retrofit schemes under different investment intervals.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}

{"title": "An Off-the-shelf Class Library to Implement Self-managing Control Systems for Adaptive Software\n", "abstract": " As software systems become increasingly complex they often need to be self-managing. Attempts to develop selfmanagement based on feedback control have typically relied on fixed control architectures with a single controller. However, because software systems operate on dynamic platforms in unpredictable environments, such fixed control system designs fail to provide effective management for the multiple operating regions of the systems. To cope with multiple regions, the control system itself requires self-tuning or reconfiguration capabilities. A number of techniques have been proposed to build such selfmanaging control systems. A major impediment to building such systems is the lack of implementation frameworks supporting the use of these techniques. These frameworks could significantly reduce the knowledge, time and cost required to create controlbased management systems from scratch. This paper describes a general engineering process to build self-managing control systems, and proposes and evaluates an extendable, configurable off-the-shelf class library to facilitate implementation of selfmanaging control in software systems.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}

{"title": "An Approach to Query Decomposition for Reader Level Filtering in RFID Middleware\n", "abstract": " In RFID systems, middleware is used to filter enormous streaming data gathered continuously from readers to process application requests. The high volume of data makes middleware often in a highly overloaded situation. Nowadays, readers are becoming smart and provide filtering functionality. The reader filtering capability can be used to reduce data volume as well as middleware work-load. However, if middleware dispatches query conditions to reader without any adjustment, it may generate huge amount of duplicate data which imposes considerable load on the middleware. So, the appropriate schema of data volume reduction is required. In this paper, we propose a query decomposition technique to divide queries into sub-queries for middleware and reader level execution. This new approach of query execution resolves the problem of duplicate data generation. Our experiments show that the proposed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}

{"title": "Towards dynamic matching of business-level protocols in adaptive service compositions\n", "abstract": " In a service composition, it is necessary to ensure that the behaviour of a constituent service is consistent with the requirements of the composition. In an adaptive service composition those behavioural requirements may be continually changing. This paper shows how the behavioural requirements in abstract service definitions (roles) can be dynamically and incrementally defined using constraints. These constraints are then used to generate finite state automata, which are used to check the compatibility of candidate services that have their behaviour expressed in static interface descriptions such as OWL-S.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}

The amphiphilic polymer was blended with the poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF) and prepared membranes by phase inversion method. The structure of the macromonomer and the molecular weight of the amphiphilic polymer were characterized by FT-IR and GPC, respectively. The morphology of the membranes was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The properties of the ultrafiltration membranes were obtained by measuring the pure water permeation flux, separation property, hydrophilicity of the surface and the fouling tendency of the membranes. The result showed that the pure water permeation flux improved from 23 L/(m~ 2\u00b7 h) to 122 L/(m~ 2\u00b7 h) and the contact angle of the membranes decreased when content of the amphiphilic polymer was varied from 0 to 15% in the bulk composition. Flux decline measurement revealed that fouling tendency of the membranes was enhanced after modification.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}

{"title": "A Framework for Integration of Hypermedia and CASE\n", "abstract": " Most current hyper-CASE systems place emphasis on how hypermedia functionality can be used in implementing CASE systems, with the hypermedia as a means of supporting the management of software life cycle documents in a non-integrated CASE environment. In this paper, we argue that hypermedia should be integrated with CASE in a seamless manner and must be able to support integrated CASE systems. A two-dimensional framework for hyper-CASE systems is proposed. One dimension of the framework emphasises the distinction between the meta layer and data layer of information held within a hyper-CASE system. The other dimension classifies this information as being at a conceptual, intermediate, or presentation level. The notions of conceptual artifacts, presentation artifacts and artifact types are introduced. This framework is used as a basis to establish different types of integration between the hypermedia and CASE components of a hyper-CASE system. Three types of integration are identified, including local, global and hybrid integration. This framework provides the basis for analysing existing hyper-CASE systems and is useful for developing new hyper-CASE systems in the future. In this paper the framework is used to analyse an existing hyper-CASE system in a case study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["648"]}
