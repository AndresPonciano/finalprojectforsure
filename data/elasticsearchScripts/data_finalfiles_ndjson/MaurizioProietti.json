{"title": "Rule-based Behavioral Reasoning on Semantic Business Processes.\n", "abstract": " We propose a rule-based framework for representing and reasoning about business processes from both the procedural and ontological point of views. To this end we define a rule-based procedural semantics for a relevant fragment of BPMN, a very popular graphical notation for specifying business processes. Our semantics defines a state transition system by following an approach similar to the Fluent Calculus, and allows us to specify state change in terms of preconditions and effects of the enactment of activities. Then we show how the procedural process knowledge can be seamlessly integrated with the domain knowledge specified by using the OWL-RL rule-based ontology language. Our framework provides a wide range of reasoning services by using standard logic programming inference engines. In particular, we can perform very sophisticated reasoning tasks by combining both procedural and domain dependent knowledge. A preliminary implementation shows that our approach is effective in practice.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["1760"]}
{"title": "Ontology-based querying of composite services\n", "abstract": " Enterprises are evolving towards advanced forms of cooperation and networking. This kind of tight cooperation requires the creation of global Business Processes (i.e., cross-enterprise composite services) composed starting from a set of existing local processes (exposed, in turn, as services) found in different enterprises. To this end, in this chapter we present an ontology-based approach for querying business process repositories for the retrieval of process fragments to be reused in the composition of new business processes. The proposed solution is based on a synergic use of a business process modelling framework (BPAL) to represent the workflow logic of business processes, and business ontologies, aimed at capturing the semantics of a business scenario. Both components are grounded in logic programming and therefore it is possible to apply effective reasoning methods to query the knowledge\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1760"]}
{"title": "A semantic framework for knowledge management in virtual innovation factories\n", "abstract": " Knowledge management is a crucial aspect for enterprises that want to effectively cope with business innovation. However, the full control of the knowledge asset is often missing due to the lack of precise organizational models, policies, and proper technologies, especially in Virtual Enterprises (VEs), which are characterized by heterogeneous partners with different policies, skills and know-how. For such reasons, the need for technologies that enable knowledge sharing, efficient access to knowledge resources, and interoperability is felt as primary. This work proposes a semantics-based infrastructure aimed at supporting effective knowledge management for business innovation in VEs. Knowledge resources are formally represented and stored in a semantic layer, which is exploited by a set of semantic services for enabling efficient retrieval and reasoning capabilities to derive additional knowledge.", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["1760"]}
{"title": "Reasoning on data-aware business processes with constraint logic\n", "abstract": " We propose a framework grounded in Constraint Logic Programming for representing and reasoning about business processes from both the workflow and data perspective. In particular, our goal is twofold:(1) define a logical language and a formal semantics for process models where data object manipulation and interactions with an underlying database are explicitly represented;(2) provide an effective inference mechanism that supports the combination of reasoning services dealing with process behavior and data properties. To this end we define a rule-based process representation coping with a relevant fragment of the popular BPMN modeling notation, extended with annotations that model data manipulation.

{"title": "An open platform for business process modeling and verification\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present the BPAL platform that includes a logicbased language for business process (BP) modeling and a reasoning mechanism providing support for several tasks. Firstly, the definition of a BP meta-model (MM) consisting of a set of rules that guide the BP designers in their work. Secondly, given a BP, the BPAL platform allows for the automatic verification of the compliance (well-formedness) of a given BP w.r.t. the defined MM. Finally, the execution semantics of a BP is given in term of its instances (referred to as traces) to provide services for i) checking if the actual execution of a BP has been carried out in accordance with the corresponding definition, ii) simulating executions by trace generation.

{"title": "Efficient generation of test data structures using constraint logic programming and program transformation\n", "abstract": " The goal of Bounded-Exhaustive Testing (BET) is the automatic generation of all test cases satisfying a given invariant, within a given size bound. When the test cases have a complex structure, the development of correct and efficient generators becomes a very challenging task. In this article we use Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) to systematically develop generators of structurally complex test data structures. We follow a declarative approach that allows us to separate the issue of (i) defining the test data structure in terms of its properties, from that of (ii) efficiently generating data structure instances. This separation helps establish the correctness of the developed test case generators. We rely on a symbolic representation and we take advantage of efficient search strategies provided by CLP systems for generating test instances.

{"title": "Linking ontologies to business process schemas\n", "abstract": " This report intends to lay the formal foundations of a framework for the semantic augmentation of BP schemas, in order to provide a declarative representation of workflow models, enriched with domain knowledge encoded by means of computational ontologies. The proposed framework is centered around BPAL (Business Process Abstract Language), a logic-based language for modeling and reason with both the structural specification and the dynamic behavior of a business process from a workflow perspective. BPAL relies on a formalism, logic programming, that is particularly well-suited for its use within a wider knowledge representation framework, in particular in conjunction with rule based ontology languages to capture the semantics of a business scenario. The resulting Business Process Knowledge Base provides a uniform and formal representation framework, suited for automatic reasoning and equipped with a powerful inference mechanism supported by the solutions developed in the area of Logic Programming. At the same time it has been conceived to be used in conjunction with the existing BP management tools as an \u201eadd-on\u201f facility, by supporting BPMN, in particular its XPDL linear form, as a modeling notation, and OWL, for the definition of the reference ontologies.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1760"]}
