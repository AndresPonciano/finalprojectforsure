{"title": "Indian medicinal herbs as sources of antioxidants\n", "abstract": " Currently there has been an increased interest globally to identify antioxidant compounds that are pharmacologically potent and have low or no side effects for use in preventive medicine and the food industry. As plants produce significant amount of antioxidants to prevent the oxidative stress caused by photons and oxygen, they represent a potential source of new compounds with antioxidant activity. Traditional herbal medicines form an important part of the healthcare system of India. Ayurveda, supposed to be the oldest medical system in the world, provides potential leads to find active and therapeutically useful compounds from plants. Considering the growing interest in assessing the antioxidant capacity of herbal medicine in this review we discuss about rarely reviewed 24 plants reported to have antioxidant properties. Some of the plants reviewed are part of multi-herbal preparations while others are used\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "690\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Canoneta) by-products\n", "abstract": " Dehydration promoted important modifications affecting both the physico-chemical properties of dietary fibre (DF) and the antioxidant capacity of orange by-products (peel and pulp remaining after juice extraction). The significance of such changes was largely dependent on the air-drying temperature used (from 30\u00a0\u00b0C to 90\u00a0\u00b0C). The major modifications on the DF components were observed when either extended drying periods, i.e. at lower temperatures, or elevated drying temperatures were applied. Dehydration around 50\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C apparently promoted the minor disruption of cell wall polymers, in particular of pectic substances. Pulp samples exhibited higher values of swelling (SW) and fat adsorption capacity (FAC) than those derived from orange peel. Although, significant decreases in water retention capacity (WRC), FAC and solubility values were detected for both by-products as the air-drying temperature\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "489\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The present study describes the clinical and laboratory profile of 100 AIDS causes who presented to a referral hospital. Oral candidiasis (59.00%) was found to be the most common opportunistic infection, followed by tuberculosis (56.00%), Cryptosporidium infection (47.00%) and Pneumocystis carinii (7.00%). Presence of oral candidiasis and weight loss is highly predictive of low DC4 count and can be considered as a marker of HIV disease progression. The patients coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis are also on rise. Recognition of dual infection and taking adequate steps to deal with this epidemic is needed. As Cryptosporidium infection was detected in large number, provision of safe drinking water and maintaining good hygiene is important for prevention. Early diagnosis of opportunistic infection and prompt treatment, delays the progression towards AIDS. 91.00% of patients were infected with HIV1 and 4.00% had HIV2 infection and 5.00% were dully infected. 87.00% of patients were males and 13.00% were belonging to 21-40 years of age.

{"title": "Cell phones and their impact on male fertility: fact or fiction\n", "abstract": " Today, cell phone technology is an integral part of everyday life and its use is not only restricted to voice conversations but also conveying news, high resolution pictures and internet. However, these advances in technology are accompanied by progressive boost in the intensity and frequency of the emitted electromagnetic waves without consideration of their health consequences. Our bodies act as parasitic antennas that receive these waves and convert them into electric and magnetic fields. While thermal effects at the present level of cell phone radiation are negligible, most of the biological interactions are attributed to non-thermal effects. Male reproductive system is highly compartmentalized and sensitive biological system that requires the integration of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to properly function. The generated electrical currents may alter the hormonal milieu and testicular microenvironment, necessary for sperm production. Additionally, sperm are electrically active cells and their exposure to cell phone electromagnetic waves and currents may affect their motility, morphology and even their count. Leaky plasma membranes, calcium depletion and oxidative stress are the postulated cellular mechanisms mediating the harmful effects of cell phones radiation on sperm and male fertility potentials. Evidences for such impacts come from designed animal and in vitro studies which may be different from in vivo human exposure. Nevertheless, the important advice is to apply strict regulations on further increase in the power density of the emitted cell phone radiation and to conduct in vivo human research to study its negative effects on fertility.", "num_citations": "110\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The present work includes initial phytochemical screening and study of ulcer protective and healing effects of methanolic extract of seeds of P. pinnata (PPSM) in rats. Phytochemical tests indicated the presence of flavonoids in PPSM. PPSM when administered orally (po) showed dose-dependent (12.5-50 mg/kg for 5 days) ulcer protective effects against gastric ulcer induced by 2 h cold restraint stress. Optimal effective dose of PPSM (25 mg/kg) showed antiulcerogenic activity against acute gastric ulcers (GU) induced by pylorus ligation and aspirin and duodenal ulcer induced by cysteamine but not against ethanol-induced GU. It healed chronic gastric ulcer induced by acetic acid when given for 5 and 10 days. Further, its effects were studied on various parameters of gastric offensive acid-pepsin secretion, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nitric oxide (NO) and defensive mucosal factors like mucin secretion and mucosal cell shedding, glycoproteins, proliferation and antioxidants; catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels. PPSM tended to decrease acid output and increased mucin secretion and mucosal glycoproteins, while it decreased gastric mucosal cell shedding without any effect on cell proliferation. PPSM significantly reversed the increase in gastric mucosal LPO, NO and SOD levels caused by CRS near to the normal level while it tended to increase CAT and GSH level decreased by CRS and ethanol respectively.

{"title": "The role of sperm chromatin integrity and DNA damage on male infertility\n", "abstract": " Infertility affects approximately a quarter of all couples. Of these cases, roughly half are due to male factors. However, more than 50% of the causes of male factor infertility are still obscure. Contemporary Andrology includes a thorough analysis of the sperm looking at the cellular and subcellular imperfections which may have an adverse effect on fertility. Defects in DNA and chromatin structure are examples of such analysis. The structure of spermatozoa DNA is very unique, highly specialized in order to control time-appropriate maturation of the zygote. Damage to sperm DNA may occur as a result of intrinsic factors such as limited defenses against oxidative stress, ageing and varicocele, or as a result of extrinsic determinants such as medications and environmental factors. This damage thereby may have negative effects on ART procedures, and could lead to failure of fertilization. Sperm DNA damage significantly contributes to the growing number of infertility cases, and should be a part of a modern andrology lab.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Rebranding and organisational performance-some issues of relevance\n", "abstract": " Dispensing with an established brand, often the culmination of many years of continuous investment, and perfunctorily replacing it with a new brand would seem to contradict a century of marketing theory and practice. Despite of this fact rebranding has become a popular strategy for companies. The idea of brands as a core asset upon which corporate success depends is deeply ingrained in modern corporate culture as well as being a central tenet of the marketing discipline. A further premise that underpins marketing education and practice is that strong brands are built through many years of sustained investment which, if well judged, will yield a loyal consumer franchise that will result in large sales, a high market share and a continuing stream of income for the brand owner. Despite this received wisdom, there has been a marked increase in the number of high-profile companies rebranding or renaming their organisations in the past few years. The efforts to discard a long-held brand name and starting again from scratch, apparently attempting to build a new brand overnight, would seem to run counter to the fundamental axioms of marketing. The question then is: what exactly is driving this spate of rebranding and what are the performance implications for the new brands? This question would seem to provide a fertile ground for academic research but, as yet, very little consideration has been given to it in the academic literature. So in the present paper the researchers have tried to explore the rationale of rebranding through data analysis by using SPSS and Excel.

{"title": "Allicin, a SUR2 opener: possible mechanism for the treatment of diabetic hypertension in rats\n", "abstract": " The garlic (Allium sativum L., Amaryllidaceae) has been popularly used in the treatment of diabetes and cardiac complications. In the present work, we have studied the possible mechanisms, sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) selectivity of allicin in diabetic hypertensive rats. Diabetic hypertension was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) followed by daily administration of dexamethasone (10 \u00b5g/kg, s.c.). Different parameters, blood pressure and blood glucose levels were studied in the rats weekly up to eight weeks. Allicin (8 mg/kg, p.o.) shows potent antidiabetic (*p<0.001) as well as antihypertensive effect (**p<0.001, *p<0.01). It may act as a vasodilator by hyperpolarizing the membrane of normal vascular smooth muscle cells. The hyperpolarization in vascular smooth muscle occurs due to K+ channel opener activity. Antihypertensive effect of allicin is inhibited by glibenclamide, nonselective SUR blocker while combination of allicin with nateglinide, selective SUR1 blocker exerted synergistic antihypertensive effect. The results indicates that allicin is effective in the treatment of diabetic hypertension; through a mechanism that might involve selective opening of SUR2.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Suryanadi Anuloma Viloma Pranayama Modifies Autonomic Activity of Heart.\n", "abstract": " Patanjali, foremost exponent of Yoga, described pranayama as the gradual unforced cessation of breathing. Pranayama is derived from two Sanskrit words-prana (life) or yama (control). Pranayam or control of prana or life force yields heart beat pulse and mind control. Yoga combines scientific technique of right behavior (Yama-Niyama), proper posture (asana), life force control (pranayama), interiorisation of the mind (pratyahara), concentration (dhyan), developing intuition (dharna) and Samadhi (ultimate realization). Suryanadisuddhi pranayama starts with closing the right nostril with the thumb of the left hand followed by exhalation through right nostril and inhaling slowly through the same nostril. This forms one round of suryanadisuddi pranayama. Pulse rate was recorded before and after twelve cycles of left nostril breathing. Thirty two readings were taken. The pulse rate dropped from 71.19\u00b16.3 to 65.88\u00b15.6 (Figure 1). The change is significant at p< 0.001. The subjects felt joy, peace and were calm.Alternate nostril breathing is a process of continuous, regularity of inhalation, holding of breath and exalation. It charges the body with an increased supply of oxygen through the lungs, this oxygen\" burns\" or oxidizes the waste impurities, chiefly carbon, in the venous blood. This process of purification is enhanced by an accompanying large increase in expulsion of waste carbondioxide from the lungs during exhalation. As a consequence, very little of the tissue remains in the blood as waste material. There is less need for the breath, as the flow to the lungs of blood for purification slows down. The heart and lungs are given extraordinary rest.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["882"]}

It requires treatment with combination therapy consisting of four to six drugs including combinations of bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs, usually for a period of 2 years. There is alarming rise in MDR and XDR-TB all over the world and better treatment options are needed to control the global MDR-TB and XDR-TB epidemic. Drugs which can shorten the treatment duration and which are free from serious adverse effects are urgently needed. Bedaquiline (TMC-207) is a newly FDA approved anti-TB drug, having unique mechanism of action ie causes inhibition of the proton pump activity of the ATP synthase in M. tuberculosis and targets the energy metabolism. It is found to active within macrophages, and is a promising agent in shortening the duration of anti-TB treatment. It is metabolized by CYP3A4, so interactions with inducers and inhibitors of this enzyme are expected. It has shown promising results in preclinical and clinical studies and it seems to be a good option for MDR and XDR-TB. Adverse effects reported in various studies were of mild nature except nausea which was the most commonly associated. Few cases of prolongation of QT intervals were reported, so it demands careful monitoring and use of bedaquiline as a reserve drug for patients in whom conventional regimens are not effective. Currently it is approved as part of combination therapy in adults of\u2265 18 year with pulmonary MDR-TB.

{"title": "Moving object tracking in video sequences based on energy of Daubechies complex wavelet transform\n", "abstract": " Object tracking in the video sequence is a challenging task because of its various applications in video compression, video surveillance, robot technology etc. Several object tracking methods exist in spatial and wavelet domain, to work with rigid and non-rigid object boundaries. Spatial domain tracking techniques are not accurate as well as they are slow and this is a major reason why wavelet domain tracking methods are getting popular. Real-valued wavelet transform suffers from shift sensitivity producing inaccurate object tracking. In this paper, we proposed a novel object tracking method using Daubechies Complex Wavelet transform (DaubCxWT). Use of this transform is suitable to track the object from video sequences because of its approximate shift-invariance nature. Tracking of object in the first frame is done by computing the Daubechies complex wavelet coefficients corresponding to the object of interest and then matching energy of these coefficients to the object neighborhood, in Daubechies complex wavelet domain, to perform the tracking in the next consecutive frames. The proposed method needs only complex wavelet coefficients for tracking and hence it is simple in implementation and tracks object efficiently.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Wireless Sensor Networks are prone to node failure due to power loss. In order to provide reliable service through the network, the network should be self-adjusting and must have adaptable properties as required from time to time. Here in this research we have proposed a new algorithm which is capable of not only to do optimize routing even with that it has the benefit to overcome through pits creating problem around the sink. We have used the Energy Efficient Shortest Path Routing algorithm for routing and multi-hop network to communicate every node with sink and have used Ant colony optimization to determine new position for a sink, so that network will communicate without any problem which generally occurred due to dead nodes around the sink. The performance of our proposed algorithm has been tested on static and mobile sink scenarios with varying speed, and compared with other state-of-the-art routing algorithms in WSN. In this research, we have investigated the impact of sink mobility on network lifetime. In a typical WSN, all the data generated in the network are routed to a static sink. Nodes near the sink tend to deplete faster in their energy which might cause holes in the network thus limiting the network lifetime. With the introduction of mobile sink, the nodes around the sink always changes, thus balancing the energy consumption in the network and improving the network lifetime.

{"title": "Using gender analysis in characterizing and understanding farm-household systems in rainfed lowland rice environments\n", "abstract": " This chapter uses gender analysis in characterizing and understanding farmhousehold systems in typical rainfed lowland rice villages in Faizabad district in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. It uses different methods of data collection such as household surveys (structured and unstructured interviews), the participatory rural appraisal, and focused group interviews. Results of the study reveal that small farming households from the lower caste tend to exploit their female family members to meet competing labor demands between farm and home-based activities. Women from the lower caste provide 60% to 80% of the total labor input in rice production. They participate in almost all rice operations, except in land preparation and application ofchemicals. When valued, the labor contributions of female members on their own farms and through exchange arrangements make up about 20% of the total labor costs in rice production per hectare. Women\u2019s labor is also crucial to nonrice crops and livestock, which are integral in rainfed rice farming systems. Because of the significant contributions of poor women in farming, their roles and needs should be considered in technology development and dissemination. Efforts are now being made to provide women farmers with access to new information and new seeds by involving them in the early evaluation of rice genotypes through participatory rice varietal selection in drought and submergence rice environments in eastern India.In recent decades, greater attention has been given to rice research on rainfed lowlands, which cover 48 million hectares in the humid and subhumid tropics of South and Southeast Asia\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["882"]}

At present, treatment options are limited, with no second line chemotherapy for those who fail first line therapy. Extensive efforts are ongoing in a bid to characterise the underlying molecular mechanisms of mesothelioma. Recent research has determined that between 70\u201390% of our genome is transcribed. As only 2% of our genome is protein coding, the roles of the remaining proportion of non-coding RNA in biological processes has many applications, including roles in carcinogenesis and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process thought to play important roles in MPM pathogenesis. Non-coding RNAs can be separated loosely into two subtypes, short non-coding RNAs (< 200 nucleotides) or long (> 200 nucleotides). A significant body of evidence has emerged for the roles of short non-coding RNAs in MPM. Less is known about the roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in this disease setting. LncRNAs have been shown to play diverse roles in EMT, and it has been suggested that EMT may play a role in the aggressiveness of MPM histological subsets. In this report, using both in vitro analyses on mesothelioma patient material and in silico analyses of existing RNA datasets, we posit that various lncRNAs may play important roles in EMT within MPM, and we review the current literature regarding these lncRNAs with respect to both EMT and MPM.

The commonly used technique of dynamic flood routing assumes a single rating curve as the downstream boundary condition, although, in general, there would be a loop rating curve even at this location. The effect of not accounting for the presence of the loop diminishes if a single rating curve is specified on an extended length of the channel. A criterion is presented for the selection of the location of a downstream control section where a unique rating curve can be supplied without introducing significant error in the computed results for the upstream sections.

Appropriate air temperature distribution in a room is necessary for thermal comfort. By using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) it is possible to compare optional ways of air supply for maintaining thermal comfort in a conditioned zone equipped with passive cooling like EATHE. Using these simulations, designer can choose the best method of air supply in the room diminishing the risk of an incorrect solution. This paper compares three cases in which integration of active (AC) and passive (EATHE) cooling was analysed with the help of CFD tool. The uniform heat flux from the surface was set to 55\u00a0W/m2, AC air velocity of 3 m/s and supply temperature kept constant at 291\u00a0K. k-\u025b model was considered for the turbulence\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Owing to the greater impact of seek time in the determination of access time for a disk having sizable number of tracks, this has been taken as the primary performance factor in the scheduling of tasks.

{"title": "A survey of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug prescription for oral implant surgery\n", "abstract": " Aim: This study was conducted to determine the preferred analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed by oral implantologists in India.Methods: A structured questionnaire was distributed to 332 dentists to gather information regarding their prescription habits for analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Frequency distributions were computed by type of drug being prescribed and the protocol followed.Results: Analysis of data showed that majority of dentists (85.8%, n= 285) prescribed conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for implant surgery. The most common prescription was ibuprofen with paracetamol combination (32.2%, n= 107) followed by diclofenac (20.2%, n= 67). Most dentists reported prescribing different NSAIDs for the same procedure in different patients (64.7%, n= 215). Only, 35.5%(n= 118) followed the peri-operative protocol. Adjunctive prescription of steroids was done by only 33.7%(n= 112).Conclusion: Our study illustrates that the general trend of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug prescription for dental implant surgery among Indian dentists is mostly in accordance with the guidelines for pain management worldwide. However, it is noteworthy that a few dentists do prescribe drugs not primarily indicated for dental pain management and use widely varying protocols for the same. Therefore, in order to avoid potential complications, it is essential to raise awareness of among the dental practitioners of the appropriate indications and dosage regimen of specific drugs.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["882"]}

A stoichiometric mixture of mischmetal, nickel and aluminium, when subjected to ball milling for 100 h in an argon atmosphere, led to the formation of MmNi4.5Al0.5. The synthesized powder was characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The low-temperature annealing of the ball-milled powder (600\u00b0C, 30 min) has been found to improve its crystallinity. Ball milling followed by low-temperature annealing yielded a MmNi4.5Al0.5 phase nearly identical to that prepared through high-temperature melting of the ingredients. Both XRD and TEM characterizations have confirmed the formation of alloy MmNi4.5Al0.5. Extensive electron microscope investigation revealed the presence of the modulated phase in local regions with modified periodicities (a = 4a0 and c = 2c0).", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["882"]}

MPPERT is suitable for incremental deployment in a heterogeneous environment. PERT, being a delay based TCP protocol, has continuous information about the state of the bottleneck queue along its path. This information is valuable in enabling MPPERT to detect subflows sharing a common bottleneck and obtain a smaller set of disjoint subflows.

Analysis of variance of stability for grain yield through Eberhart and Russell\u2019s model and AMMI analysis revealed highly significant differences among genotypes and environments and significant genotype x environment (G x E) interaction (GEI). Highly significant mean squares due to environment + genotype x environment interactions (E + G x E) in the Eberhart and Russell model revealed that genotype interacted considerably with environmental conditions that existed under TSI and LSI condition. Further partitioning of E + G x E effects indicated that E (linear), G x E (linear) component, and pooled deviation were highly significant for grain yield. Some genotypes showed linear effects over environments, while others showed significant deviation from a linear relationship. Partitioning of G x E interaction into principal components in AMMI analysis revealed that the two interaction principal component axes accounted for 90.4% of the total GEI variation.

In recent years the CQA sites gain the huge popularity on the web. Searching the information is a very difficult task in CQA sites which is solved with the help of tags, but users assign the tags according to their knowledge. The CQA sites maintain metadata related to the posts, user and tags which can be utilized efficiently for recommending the tags. In this paper, a new algorithm, namely, TAGme, is proposed for tag recommendation in CQA sites. The proposed TAGme algorithm uses the concept of topic modeling, folksonomy and collaborative filtering. The proposed algorithm consists of three major stages. In the first stage, topical folksonomies are developed using the CQA metadata user, tag, topics the posts.

{"title": "Effect of different soil moisture regimes on biomass partitioning and yield of chickpea genotypes under intermediate zone of J & K\n", "abstract": " Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is most important pulse crop in the Indian sub-continent. It is generally grown on stored soil moisture, making terminal drought stress a major constraint to productivity. A considerable area of about 43,435 ha remains unutilized during rabi season in most parts of the intermediate zone and foothills of the Shivalik ranges in subtropical rainfed area of Jammu region especially after the harvest of long duration rice and maize crops. Chickpea can be a good alternate crop under these conditions to encourage double cropping in otherwise mono-cropped area. As the temperature during sowing time varies in different growing areas of Jammu province due to variable agro-climatic conditions so there is a requirement of chickpea genotypes that can perform well across these regions. On the other hand water deficit is another constraint in the area during crop growth. However, the influence of water deficit on distribution of assimilate depends on stage of the growth and relative sensitivity of various plant organs to water deficit. Greater proportions of photosynthates are allocated to pods and seeds when the crop is stressed after flowering or when raised completely without irrigation (Deshmukh et al. 2004). The development of moisture stress leads to a wide range of changes in plant processes like diversion of biomass to undesirable plant parts. The chickpea genotypes with better biomass partitioning and mobilization efficiency will be suitable for cultivation in the rainfed. Therefore, the present investigation was conducted with the objectives to identify suitable chickpea genotypes that can perform well under water deficit\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Neovascular glaucoma\n", "abstract": " Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) was first described in the late nineteenth century as a condition in which the eye developed progressive neovascularization of the iris (NVI) and angle (NVA). Though widely described as congestive glaucoma, rubeotic glaucoma, thrombotic glaucoma, and hemorrhagic glaucoma, the current preferred terminology is neovascular glaucoma as proposed by Weiss et al. 1 It has since been discovered that there are numerous systemic diseases and secondary ocular conditions that share one common underlying etiology: retinal ischemia and hypoxia. Under conditions of retinal ischemia, a pro-angiogenic cascade is triggered that promotes the development of new, fragile, leaky blood vessels on the surface of the iris and the angle. NVG progresses through the growth of a fibrovascular membrane over the trabecular meshwork in the anterior chamber angle that can contract and cause secondary closed-angle glaucoma. Left untreated, NVG causes advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy and irreversible visual loss. Both early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent these serious complications.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Nitrogen was applied at three levels, viz. 0, 90 and 120 kg ha\u22121 through N-15 labelled urea alone or in combination with green manure (GM) or farmyard manure (FYM) in two ratios (2:1 and 1:1). Urea applied alone or its combined application with organics resulted in a similar grain yield. However, substitution of N up to 50% either through GM or FYM resulted in reduction of straw yield as compared to urea alone. There was hardly any accumulation of NO3-N in soil, though NH4-N content remained sufficiently high up to 55 days after transplanting (DAT). Application of urea along with FYM or GM significantly improved its use efficiency (8\u201315%) over that of urea alone.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["882"]}
{"title": "Effect of fertigation on nitrogen dynamics in Broccoli\n", "abstract": " The present investigation was carried out during November to February months of 1996-97 to study the movement of nitrogen and water as affected by irrigation and fertigation on sprouting broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica L.) variety Packman in sandy loam soil (Typic Ustochrept) at the experimental farm of the Water Technology Centre, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. The experiment was laid out in randomised block design with four replications consisting of five treatments which included application of the recommended fertilizer dose as soil application and irrigation through drip system as well as three levels of fertigation 100, 80 and 60 per cent of recommended fertilizer doses. Check basin irrigation with the recommended fertilizer dose was treated as Control. Water and nutrient profiles were monitored horizontally and vertically during the crop growth period. The results indicated that through drip irrigation the soil water status was maintained at the optimum level in the root zone of the crop (0-50 cm) which extended upto 30 cm horizontally from the plant. Ammonium concentration was maximum below the emitter decreasing as the wetting zone moved away from the emitter. The zone of peak nitrate ion concentration was always below the surface layer in drip irrigation treatments. Yields obtained indicated that substantial savings in the fertilizer applied (20 to 40 per cent) could be accomplished through fertigation. The spatial distribution of ammonium, nitrate and water content indicates that designing the drip system is very important in fertigation studies for maximizing both water and fertilizer use efficiency.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Unity in diversity: Learning distributed heterogeneous sentence representation for extractive summarization\n", "abstract": " Automated multi-document extractive text summarization is a widely studied research problem in the field of natural language understanding. Such extractive mechanisms compute in some form the worthiness of a sentence to be included into the summary. While the conventional approaches rely on human crafted document-independent features to generate a summary, we develop a data-driven novel summary system called HNet, which exploits the various semantic and compositional aspects latent in a sentence to capture document independent features. The network learns sentence representation in a way that, salient sentences are closer in the vector space than non-salient sentences. This semantic and compositional feature vector is then concatenated with the document-dependent features for sentence ranking. Experiments on the DUC benchmark datasets (DUC-2001, DUC-2002 and DUC-2004) indicate that our model shows significant performance gain of around 1.5-2 points in terms of ROUGE score compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Ants of the artificial colony are able to generate successively shorter feasible path by using information accumulated in the form of a pheromone trail. Ant colony optimization is already used in too many areas from graph related problems to the medical problem and study of Genomics to communication networks etc.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["882"]}
{"title": "Study of the dermoscopic findings and their correlation with histopathological findings in various lichenoid dermatoses\n", "abstract": " Background: Lichenoid disorders are often difficult to diagnose clinically. Dermoscopy can act as an alternative technique to skin biopsy for diagnosis of various lichenoid dermatoses.Study aim: To study the correlation of dermoscopic with histopathological findings in various lichenoid dermatoses Methods: Fifty patients with clinical picture of lichenoid dermatoses were examined first under the dermoscope, followed by skin biopsy from the same site. The findings of both methods were recorded and correlated.Results: Nonvascular findings were the predominant features on dermoscopy out of which white structures were present in 93.33% of patients of classical lichen planus, 50% of actinic lichen planus, 90% of lichen planus hypertrophicus, 50% of lichen planopilaris and in only the case of lichen simplex chronicus. In classical lichen planus patients, a particular pattern of white structures with linear streaks arranged in a radial manner (starburst pattern) was observed. In lichen planus, it is suggested that the white structures on dermoscopy corresponded histologically to hyperkeratosis. Gray-blue dots or brown punctate areas represented melanophages in dermis. In lichen planus pigmentosus and ashy dermatosis patients, no specific patterns could be observed. In lichen planus hypertrophicus, white structures, corn pearls and comedolike openings appeared to represent hyperkeratosis and hypergranulosis, while pigmentation of variable colors could be due to presence of melanophages in the dermis.Conclusion: Dermoscopy can be a valuable tool for the dermatological diagnosis and may obviate need for skin biopsy.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["882"]}

It is a high protein food and forms a major part of the African diet. Paste prepared from cowpea is usually consumed in the form of akara (fried cowpea paste), moin-moin (steamed cowpea paste), and koki (whipped and steamed paste with spices and palm oil). To make akara, whole cowpea seeds are soaked, decorticated by rubbing, and ground using a mortar and pestle (wet milling).

While MABB can improve a variety with respect to introgressed trait(s), it offers very little scope for improvement of other traits. Marker assisted restricted backcross breeding (MARBB) is an alternative which can help in identifying transgressive segregants especially, when the donor parent is an elite genotype with several desirable traits. In the present study, restricted backcrossing followed by pedigree selection was used for the development of improved genotypes of Basmati rice with BB and blast diseases using an early maturing Basmati rice variety, Pusa Basmati 1509 as recurrent parent and an elite restorer line, Pusa 1790 as donor. Foreground selection for xa13, Xa21, Pi2 and Pi54 in the backcross progenies was combined with phenotypic selection for agronomic and grain quality traits to ensure premium Basmati grain quality in the progenies. Multi-location yield trial was conducted to evaluate the performance of the improved Basmati rice genotypes with both BB and blast resistance.

The heat exchange by cooling media for different configurations and material is studied. The influence of inlet air temperature, humidity, mass flow rate of air and supply air temperature has been discussed by using octagon-cooling media. It is evident that the octagon cooling media is more efficient than hexagonal cooling media for hot and dry climate in central India. Additionally, Octagon cooling media provides higher mass flow rate of supply air than hexagonal cooling media for same input of air. The comparison between hexagonal and octagonal cooling media shows that saturation efficiency is 93.6% for octagonal cooling media made of Aspen fibre at 40.5 C DBT, whereas cooling capacity is 47769.81 Watt that is more than for the former. When the thickness of hexagonal and octagonal cooling media kept same then saturation efficiency decreases with increase in cooling capacity.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["882"]}

This asexual mode of reproduction may prove to be an unrivalled crop improvement tool to achieve higher yields and along with highly desirable traits in modern agriculture. In fact, apomixis results in offspring that are exact genetic replicas of its single parent because embryos are derived from the parthenogenic development of apomeiotic egg cells. The development of crops with apomictic ability to produce true to type progenies in agriculture requires a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms regulating reproductive development in plants.

The project output resets automatically after a brief interruption in the event temporary fault while it remain remains in tripped condition in case of permanent fault. The electrical substation which supply the power to the consumers, have failures due to some faults which can be temporary or permanent. These faults lead to substantial damage to the power system equipment. In India it is common, the faults might be LG (Line to Ground), LL (Line to Line), 3L (Three lines) in the supply systems and these faults in three phase supply system can affect the power system. To overcome this problem a system is built, which can sense these faults and automatically disconnects the supply to avoid large scale damage to the control gears in the grid sub-stations. This project is designed to understand about the basic operation of the relay and what are all the advanced techniques that are being used by the people to ensure the safe operation of the electrical appliance. The circuit will isolate the load from the supply if any power fluctuation occurred. The major advantage of the project is, it not only save the appliance but it will also show the type of the fault that has been occurred in the system so that it will be easy for the operator to solve the problem easily. It will also check whether the fault is a permanent or a temporary fault.

The main goal of this research work is to parallelize the process of texture based image retrieval through entropy, standard deviation, and local range, also whole process is much faster than normal. Our work uses extensive usage of highly multithreaded architecture of multi-cored GPU. We evaluated the retrieval of the proposed technique using Recall, Precision, and Average Precision measures. Experimental results showed that parallel implementation led to an average speed up of 140.046\u00d7 over the serial implementation. The average Precision and the average Recall of presented method are 39.67% and 55.00% respectively.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Ethnobotanical studies shows that juice of this plant is used traditionally in chronic bronchitis, sore throat, toothache and is applied to skin eruptions, cuts and wounds. Phytochemical screening of the dried plant extract showed the presence of alkaloids, proteins, carbohydrates, cardiac glycosides, saponins, triterpenoids, tannins and phenols. The antibacterial activity of this plant was carried out using agar disc diffusion method at different concentrations of crude extracts against 12 bacterial strains pathogenic to human beings. Among the seven extracts assayed, acetone and ethanol extracts were found to be most active that exhibit antibacterial activity against most of the studied bacterial strains. Therefore, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of acetone and ethanol extracts was determined against the selected bacterial strains showing zones of inhibition \u2265 10 mm. The results indicate the potential of L. indica Vatke in treating bacterial infections, thus, justifying their traditional use in the treatment of chronic bronchitis, sore throat, toothache and skin eruptions, which are of infectious origin.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Twenty nine genotypes were evaluated in 4 environments under irrigated and un-irrigated conditions for their yield performance. Data on 10 yield component (days to flowering, days to maturity, plant height, branches per plant, pods per plant, seeds per pod, 100-seed weight, biological yield, seed yield per plant and harvest index) were used to investigate the effects of genotype, environment and G x E. On partitioning these components into linear and non-linear components, both were responsible for expression of the traits. However, the linear component was found larger in magnitude than the nonlinear component suggesting that variation in the performance of different cultivars could be predicted. The genotypes Pusa 1105, BG 2050, DG 5003 DG 5008 and DG 5009 were found suitable for irrigated environments for grain yield. For moisture stress environment four genotypes Pusa 1003, Pusa 1053, DG 5005 and DG 5055 were found stable for grain yield. For the days to maturity only two genotypes Pusa 1105 and Pusa 1105 were found stable across environments. Thus these genotypes could be used for commercial cultivation. The stability measures are useful in characterizing cultivars by showing their relative performance in various environments.

Yield losses due to drought ranged from 30 to 70%. In eastern Uttar Pradesh, yield loss in drought prone areas is due to mainly early stage drought coupled with later stage encounters with low temperatures, which leads to poor crop establishment and grain sterility. Results of several studies showed that field screening for tolerance to water deficit at vegetative stage has been difficult to demonstrate a consistent relationship between seedling/vegetative stage drought score and yield performance in target environments (Mackill et. al., 1996; Mitchell et al., 1998). Yield improvement in water-limited environments could be achieved through selection for secondary traits, which are more reliable and constitutive in contributing to drought resistance in breeding programmes. Therefore, preliminary field testing trials were conducted in a rainout shelter for phenotypic selection and to determine their contribution viz. drought resistance and stability performance of genotypes.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Bending results in reduced bandgap in graphene and affects the spin transport by increasing current in parallel configuration (PC) resulting in an increase in magnetoresistance (MR). In antiparallel configuration (APC), bending limits the spin-down current, which results in higher magnetoresistance at all biases. In bended graphene, the magnetoresistance obtained is higher than the MR obtained in pristine and twisted graphene-based structure. High spin filtration for PC and APC is observed in the case of bended graphene as compared with pristine and twisted graphene. However, pristine graphene gives better spin filtration compared with twisted graphene at low voltages.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The objective of study was to assess heavy metal and organic pollution of Yamuna river water vis a vis irrigation water quality standards in Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh. Four sampling sites viz., E1, E2, E3 and E4 were selected along Yamuna stretch in Etawah district and samples were collected in summer and post-rainy seasons during 2016. Six heavy metals (i.e., Pb, Cd, Fe, Cu, Cr and Zn), dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of river water were analysed. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI) was used to determine severity of heavy metal pollution in the river. The mean concentration of heavy metals followed the order of Fe> Pb> Zn> Cd> Cr> Cu in summer and Fe> Zn> Cr> Pb> Cd> Cu in post-rainy season. Pb, Fe, Zn and Cu were present within permissible limits as per irrigation water quality standards in both the seasons. The concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu decreased by 82%, 73%, 34% and 76%, respectively, whereas that of Fe and Zn increased by 29% and 48%, respectively, during post-rainy season. Heavy metal pollution index (HPI) of each sampling site revealed highest pollution at E2 site. Mean HPI for Yamuna water in summer i.e., 1534 decreased to 412 in post-rainy season.

These compounds are extensively associated with economically important plants, and may provide protective capacity against cellular oxidative stresses. Although known to be present in plants for over 100 years, interest and research about glucosinolate formation, function, and potential benefits to human health has taken place in recent times. Glucosinolates are simple organic compounds consisting of a core molecule combined with different side chains, which contribute to their diversity and subsequently determine the nature of hydrolysis products. Injured or affected plant tissue brings the compartmentalised enzyme myrosinase into contact with the localised glucosinolate, which separates the glucose group from the parent glucosinolate. These compounds have been shown to have the potential to contribute to human nutritional wellbeing, as plants high in glucosinolates are known to possess anti-carcinogenic and anti-microbial properties. Developments in the understanding of glucosinolate transport have recently progressed. This work has shown that changes in the biochemistry of the parent glucosinolate are possible at the site of damage, without the sole reliance of long distance phloem transport. The purpose of this review paper is to provide an update on recent developments which have taken place in the understanding of glucosinolate biosynthesis, biology and transport.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Asymptomatic bronchogenic cysts may become symptomatic and produce complications with passage of time. Therefore, removal of the cyst is advised. We present a case that was diagnosed as asymptomatic bronchogenic cyst. Therapeutic drainage of cystic fluid through a bronchoscope was attempted, which led to rupture of the cyst and leakage of cystic fluid into the mediastinum and pleural space, leading to complications. Finally, thoracotomy was performed, and the bronchogenic cyst was surgically removed. After surgery, the patient recovered completely.

Condition for a large amount of energy to be confined near the surface has been also found which indicates that a large portion of energy can flow along the interface for horizontally polarized shear waves with group velocity lower than the shear wave velocity in the upper mantle. Effects of reinforcement, magnetoelastic coupling parameter and inhomogeneity on phase velocity have been depicted by means of graphs. It is observed that presence of reinforcement and magnetic field favours the phase velocity while inhomogeneity in the halfspace decreases it. Variation in group velocity has been shown separately and finally surface plot of group velocity is drawn for wave number and depth parameter.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Can killers be saviors?\n", "abstract": " Autoimmunity and cancer have a multifarious epidemiology. Often, it is because of an impaired genome, culminating in functional aberrations in the human system. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous complex disease which ensues due to the failure of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self antigens, thus producing autoantibodies against DNA, RNA and proteins. Cancer, the other side of the same coin, results from an excessive proliferation of cells that evade immune regulation as a result of incompetent defense by T-cells, B-cells and macrophages. Recent findings have indicated that lupus autoantibodies could be used as an effective weapon to kill cancerous cells.

These foraminifera either are absent or do not occur commonly in shallow marine carbonates of tropical to subtropical regions. Larger benthic foraminifera (LBF) were the major contributors of such carbonates in the geologic past and continue to be a common element of the present-day carbonates in shallow sea environments. In the present study, we collected live specimens of a miliolid foraminifer (Marginopora kudakajimaensis) and a rotaliid foraminifer (Amphistegina lessonii) over different seasons for field-based calibration of \u03b418O to estimate seawater temperatures.

Despite the initial success of androgen ablation therapy, resistance to anti-androgen therapy manifests by progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is the end stage that accounts for the majority of PCa patient deaths. Docetaxel (DTX) is an approved drug for the treatment of CRPC. However, development of DTX resistance and toxicity are the major limitations in the use of DTX in the treatment of CRPC. Now we investigated to determine whether these limitations may be overcome by combining DTX with plumbagin (PL). PL is a quinoid constituent isolated from the root of Plumbago zeylanica L.

Ambala, Agra, Lucknow and Bareilly. The least square means (LSD) of body weight at first calving, age at first calving, first dry period, first calving interval, first service period first lactation milk yield, herd life milk yield, and first lactation period were 503.73\u00b12.68 kg, 1 268.39\u00b115.32 days, 173.01\u00b15.18 days, 467.74\u00b17.42 days, 171.37\u00b17.04 days, 1 702.44\u00b131.015 kg, 5 459.97\u00b176.21 kg, 296.30\u00b13.95 days respectively under model 2 and 501.72\u00b12.58 kg, 1281.33\u00b111.89 days, 173.38\u00b14.49 days, 468.39\u00b16.12 days, 171.74\u00b15.89 days, 1 709.04\u00b125.04 kg, 5 457.49\u00b165.01 kg, 296.74\u00b13.17 days respectively under model 8. The least squares means estimated by model 8 were slightly higher than the means estimated by model 2. The sire had accounted more variation under model 8 than model 2 for body weight at first calving. Since all the traits were analyzed simultaneously under model 2, therefore, there may be some confounding among traits which decreased sire contribution in total variation with body weight at first calving. But that was not the case with model 8 as all the traits were analyzed separately. Additive (direct), environmental and phenotypic variances estimated from univariate and multivariate animal models agreed closely for all the traits.

The results of real-time PCR were compared with gold standard L-J proportion method and further validated by DNA sequencing. Of the 143 MTB positive cultures, 85 and 58 isolates were found to be \u2018MDR\u2019 and \u2018pan susceptible\u2019, respectively by proportion L-J method. The sensitivity of real-time PCR for the detection of rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) were 85.88 and 94.11%, respectively, and the specificity of method was found to be 98.27%. DNA sequencing of 31 MTB isolates having distinct melting temperature (Tm) as compared to the standard drug susceptible H37Rv strain showed 100% concordance with real-time PCR results.

The generation mean analysis revealed importance of additive (d) and/or dominance (h) gene effects as well as one or more of the epistatic gene interactions (i, j, l) for all the seven characters in most of the crosses under both the conditions. However, nature and magnitude of gene effects and epistatic interactions for a character exhibited considerable variation across the six crosses and two environmental conditions. Significance of dominance gene effects and epistatic interactions for most of the traits in six crosses under two conditions indicated that exploitation of heterosis through hybrid varieties appears to be a potential alternative. Only in drought condition, considerable number of crosses exhibited positive and significant estimates of standard heterosis across seven characters. Present study indicated apparent lack of desirable heterosis of requisite degree. It appears that extremely diverse nature of parents involved in six cross combinations may have resulted in incompatible gene combinations or genetic architecture in crosses resulting into poor performance and lack of heterosis for most of the characters.

However, its production is constrained by high cost of water soluble P fertilizers that are beyond the reach of most tropical poor farmers and hence, the need to study alternative sources of P that could provide information on how to increase the yield of the crop. Thus the present study was undertaken to study the influence of phosphorus sources on the yield and yield components of groundnut varieties in the region. Two field experiments were conducted during 2007 and 2008 rainy seasons at the Dryland Teaching and Research Farm of the Department of Crop Science, Usmanu Danfodiyo University Sokoto, Sokoto State, Nigeria. Treatments consisted of factorial combination of two groundnut varieties and three phosphorus sources [Sokoto rock phosphate, single super phosphate and a control (the crop relying on soil residual P from the preceding crop's fertilizer application)]. The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design replicated three times. The results revealed that number of pods per plant, pod yield, kernel yield, shelling percentage and harvest index were higher in Ex-Dakar variety. The performance of the crop was not influenced by direct application of phosphorus on the crop. Thus, from the findings of this study Ex-Dakar variety could be suggested for increased groundnut production in the study area.

Cluster analysis based on Tocher\u2019s methods of pooled fielddata of agromorphological traits from all three environment and two locations grouped pigeonpea genotypes into nine clusters. Genetic divergence was mainly contributed by days to 50% flowering (30.14%) followed by100 seed weight (20.78%) and protein content (12.56%). The range of polymorphic information content (PIC) for microsatellites was 0.055-0.695. A total of 104 alleles were amplified with 42 SSR markers with an average of 2.48 alleles per locus. Ten alleles were unique to inter-specific derivatives. Based on Shannon\u2019s information index (I), ASSR 17 was the most informative locus for all the genotypes. Two loci, ASSR114 and ASSR317 were polymorphic only among the interspecific derivatives. Cophenetic correlations were statistically significant for phenograms based on Euclidean distances and average Manhattan distance analysis. The first three principal coordinates explained 60.17% and 57.22% of the accumulated variation in case of agromorphological traits and microsatellite data respectively.

This period in time revealed one of the most impressive technology revolutions initiated by the control of material properties on an atomic level, enabling the formation of quantum wells and superlattices, ie, the superposition of quantizing periodic potentials with widths typically in the~ 10 nm ranges superimposed to the natural potential pattern of the solid host. Most of the groundbreaking work was done by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)[1, 2], which allows the epitaxial growth of abrupt two-dimensional selectively doped layer sequences [3, 4].

It is important to maintain an agreement amongst gain, bandwidth, return loss and VSWR characteristics of antenna. In this paper an exclusive design concept for the circular patch antenna is introduced. Initially a circular microstrip patch antenna is designed and the performance of this new design is enhanced after applying different types of slotted perturbations in one half of antenna. The antenna performance is transformed from single band to multiband by employing \u2018Y\u2019shape slotted structures. The proposed antenna represents quad band behavior at resonant frequencies 2.44 GHz, 6.48 GHz, 7 GHz and 8.25 GHz with a good value of return loss of-12.29 dB,-16.48 dB,-15 dB and-27.81 dB respectively. This design also represents VSWR between the specified range of 1 to 2 for the said resonant frequencies with an acceptable value of gain in dB. The antenna is designed and simulated with FEM based electromagnetic field solver. The proposed antenna design is suitable for WLAN, Radio astronomy, Passive sensors and Point to Point defense system wireless applications. The proposed antenna is analyzed for proper coaxial feed location using radial basis function neural networks. The results obtained using RBF neural networks are in a good agreement to the simulation results obtained using electromagnetic solver. The feed location provided by the RBF neural networks results in six band behavior.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The organization must work to develop and nurture engagement, which requires a two-way relationship between employer and employee.\u2019Thus Employee engagement is a barometer that determines the association of a person with the organization. As a researcher this concept requires careful investigation and the interest, therefore is to extract the determinants of employee engagement and to understand what all factors contribute to this concept.

{"title": "Effect of Process Parameters on the Surface Roughness of A713 Alloy Castings produced by Investment casting process\n", "abstract": " In the present work, an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of various process parameters on the surface roughness of A713 aluminum alloy. Experiments were conducted with different process parameters like wax composition, binders, firing temperature and the pouring temperature by varying their levels. In each case the surface roughness of aluminum alloy was determined. The experimental data obtained were used to optimize the value of the process parameters retaining minimum surface roughness. The effect of varying levels of the aforesaid process parameters on the surface roughness was investigated. Taguchi method was used to optimize the required composition of the waxes. Percentage contribution and the optimized values of the process parameters have also been deduced out by ANOVA approach applied to Taguchi method. The wax composition has the major contribution and the influence of binder used is insignificant.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["882"]}
{"title": "Crop diversification through maize based cropping systems\n", "abstract": " India has become self-sufficient in food grain production and the cereal based cropping systems imparted great role in it. Further there is need to increase the production not only of the cereals but also of other commodities like fodder, feed, fiber, fuel etc. to meet the demand of burgeoning population. This is possible either through increase in area or productivity or both. But scope for horizontal expansion is negligible, only vertical expansion in crop production is the option left to fulfill the demand of various commodities. In this way, crop diversification with intensified sequential and inter cropping plays a key role. Crop diversification refers to a shifting or bringing a desirable change in the existing cropping systems towards more balanced cropping systems to meet ever rising demand of food, fiber, fuel, fodder etc. and aim to improve soil health and profit (Banu et al., 2005). At present among cereal based cropping systems, rice-wheat, rice-rice, pearl millet-wheat, maize-wheat and sorghum\u2013wheat are the major cropping systems and occupy 85% area. The continuous cultivation of these cropping systems results in various problems viz. reduced soil fertility in root zone with specific reference to micronutrients, declining water table, infestation of similar kinds of pests and predominance of specific weeds, which is resulting in reduced efficacy and sustainability of the cropping systems (Katyal, 2003). Crop diversification is one of the major components for sustainable production under these changing situations. It also helps in overcoming the problems like excessive mining of soil nutrients and ground water, mitigating ill effects of abnormal weather\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["882"]}

However, if they are beneficiated and enriched to around 64% Fe, which is possible only in fine size range, they can be utilized in a pelletization plant. The feed sample assayed 37.52% Fe, 42.23% silica and 0.82% alumina. Microscopic studies reveal that the silica bands contain some hematite and the hematite bands are also not free from silica. It was observed from the liberation data that reasonable degree of liberation is achieved only below 150 micron size.Beneficiation studies using various unit operations such as hydrocyclone, falcon concentrator, Low Intensity Magnetic Separation (LIMS), Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separation (WHIMS) and flotation etc. were carried out to develop a suitable process flowsheet as a step towards the up-gradation of iron values and to reduce the gangue content.

{"title": "Structure, function and applications of bacterio-rhodopsin-A photoreceptor protein in the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarium\n", "abstract": " Halobactrium salinarium. It converts light energy into chemical energy by functioning as a light-induced proton pump. It has attracted a great deal of interdisciplinary attention in recent years because of its unique structural and functional features, and potential applications in molecular electronics. The chromophore of bR is a retinylidene unit covalently bound to an e-amino group of a lysine residue through a protonated Schiff base linkage. In its native state, bR has purple colour, which is believed to be due to specific interactions between the retinylidene chromophore and the surrounding protein residues. Absorption of photon by bR results in a photocyclic process resulting in proton translocation across the halobacterial cell membrane. The proton motive force thus generated is ultimately utilized for phosphorylation of ADP to ATP required for the vital functions of the halobacteria.A molecular level understanding of the functioning of bR was expected to provide an overall chemical knowledge of the general mechanism by which light-induced sensory and energy transductions occur in biology. Consequently, soon after the discovery of bR feverish research activities on the structure and proton-pump mechanism of bR started using chemical, biochemical, molecular biological, photochemical, photophysical, spectroscopic, and theoretical methodologies resulting in an invaluable wealth of information on the structure, photocycle and proton-pump mechanism of bR. Soon after the build-up of some chemical understanding of the structure, photocycle and mechanism of proton pump, the unique photobiological properties of bR were recognized to be of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Kinetics and mechanism of the oxidation of reducing sugars by osmium tetroxide in alkaline medium\n", "abstract": " A general mechanism for oxidizing reducing sugars (pentoses, hexoses and disaccharides) by OsO4 in alkaline medium is proposed. The reactions exhibit pseudounimolecular kinetics with respect to OsO4, are first order with respect to lower [sugar] and [OH\u2212], but tend towards zeroth order with respect to both higher [sugar] and [OH\u2212]. These results suggest the formation of an activated complex between the enediol andd osmium tetroxide, which slowly disproportionates to give osmium(VI) species and the intermediate products. The reaction products were identified. When an aldehydo sugar is treated with alkali, structural changes occur and an equilibrium is set up, mainly involving a keto sugar product and the starting aldehydo sugar consumed. This process is reversible. These changes are mainly due to the well-known Lobry-de-Bruyn-Alberda Van Ekenstein transformations.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The nonlinear rarefactive pulse is observed to undergo fissioning as it propagates. Measurements of the ion velocity distribution function within the pulse indicate strong modifications of the distribution functions at velocities in the neighbourhood of the ion acoustic speed. Wave\u2013particle interaction is thus shown to play an important role in the observed behaviour. Large-amplitude rarefactive pulses, while showing multiple fissioning, also exhibit a large-amplitude, low-frequency (\u224830 kHz) oscillatory tail, downstream of the main pulse. The oscillatory tail is unlike the expected Airy function that normally accompanies a weakly nonlinear rarefactive pulse.

The cause of the appearance of this lactate peak was neuronal degradation: neuronal degradation leads to release of lactate. The reasons for the damage could be assigned to acoustical streaming produced by acoustical vibrations (4.0 W at 15.0 kHz). Gases dissolved in soft or hard tissue (skull) form bubbles which oscillate with their resonant frequency causing acoustic streaming and microstreaming. This streaming has produced neuronal damage, and hence the appearance of the lactate peak at 1.3 ppm.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["882"]}

In this regard utilization of internal combustion engine exhaust waste heat and environmental pollution have been the focus of research in the recent past. About 35% of the automotive input fuel energy is converted to useful crankshaft work and about 30% energy is expelled with exhaust. This leaves about one-third (35%) of the total energy that must be transmitted from the enclosed cylinder through the cylinder walls and head to the surrounding. The exhausted energy from engine results in entropy elevation and solemn environmental pollution. So it is desired to utilize waste heat to the extent possible.

{"title": "Efficient Management of Community Question Answering Sites using Improved Spectral Clustering.\n", "abstract": " Community Question-Answering (CQA) sites are the major platform where posts are generated by peers in the form of questions and answers for information seeking in online environments. In general, multiple posts are created by different users on a particular topic or subject. Large number of posts raises the difficulties in information management of these sites. A number of approaches are suggested in recent research work for efficient management of data for CQA sites. Many of the existing approaches have suggested use of clustering techniques for managing the CQA sites, but ignored the tagging data (user tags) of the posts. In this paper, an improved spectral clustering technique is derived based on similarity measures for text processing (SMTP) and utilized for clustering the posts considering the tagging data available on CQA sites. A specialized data structure, namely, folksonomy is developed for clustering using the relationship between tags, posts and users. The proposed method is developed in two stages. In first stage, the folksonomy relation is created and post similarity graph is built with the help of tag frequency-inverse post frequency. In the second stage, the spectral clustering algorithm is applied to the post similarity matrix to group the similar posts. The post clusters are generated as the output of the proposed algorithm where the post information management can be made with the help of user tags. The experimental results show that the improvedspectral clustering algorithm outperforms the other considered clustering algo", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Each of these openings in a mechanized depillaring (MD) operation along the extraction line is supported by the roof bolt-based breaker line support (RBBLS) to restrict the goaf encroachment. Different field studies by Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CSIR-CIMFR) found that the RBBLS works effectively during the depillaring under the shadow of stable surrounding ribs/fenders only. It is observed that, generally, these natural supports experience high value of induced stresses after a large amount of void creation inside the goaf. The induced stress creates spalling/loosening of the sides of the natural supports. Field studies also found that the positions of the RBBLS at the goaf edge need to be adjusted according to the depth of this spalling/loosening. However, a systematic study in field for the correct positioning of the breaker line as per the spalling/loosening under different site conditions is difficult. Therefore, on the basis of the data and guidance provided by these field investigations, a detailed parametric investigation was conducted in the laboratory on simulated models for an effective design of RBBLS in a MD panel.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a well known and a type of'staph'bacteria bacteria Subject Category: Organism Namessee more details that are resistant to many commonly used antimicrobial agents and thus, making it more difficult to treat. MRSA universally attach to surfaces and produce biofilm, especially with implants of medical devices such as urinary catheters, orthopaedic implants, cardiac pacemakers, tracheal and ventilator tubing etc. and thus, causing infections. Biofilms particularly are difficult to treat in medical situations is because of their increasing resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, there is a continuing need to develop newer methods of treating MRSA infections. Several in-vitro studies have shown that phages can be used to infect biofilm cells. Depolymerases can penetrate the inner layer of the biofilm by degrading the components of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix and this happens when the phages induce the production of depolymerases.

{"title": "Facial nerve in foetal cadavers: an anatomical study with clinical relevance\n", "abstract": " Introduction: Facial nerve paralysis is a major complication of parotid surgery and is widely reported. Little attention is paid to the facial nerve trunk in children. The facial nerve trunk in children and infants can be easily injured since they lie close to the surface. The present study therefore intends to describe the variability in the facial nerve trunk and its branching pattern in foetuses. Methods: The study was done bilaterally in 30 formalin-fixed foetuses (15 females, 15 males), age ranging from 21.0 to 35.5 weeks of gestation. The length of the facial nerve trunk was measured and bifurcation and trifurcation of the trunk was examined. Variability in the branching pattern was also noted. Results: The most common facial nerve trunk branching type was bifurcation (53.33%), followed by trifurcation (33.33%). Multiple branching of the facial nerve was also observed in 13.34% of the cases. Other variations related to the facial nerve were also noted. The mean length of the facial nerve trunk was 7.15\u00b12.12 mm. There was no significant difference between the right and left sides and in case of males and female foetuses. Conclusion: Facial nerve injury during parotid surgery is a main cause of paediatric facial paralysis. The length of the facial nerve trunk therefore must be accurately known in any surgical procedure planned in the area. The main furcation of the facial nerve should also receive special attention.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}

This imprecise data indicates the presence of vagueness, incompleteness and uncertainty which causes the problem during important decision-making task. The present paper focuses on the problem of mining important inference from supermarket basket data (in the presence of vagueness). The paper specifically studies the usefulness of vague set theory for the exploration of hesitation information and vague association rules. The hesitation information of an item plays a vital role in making selling strategies for the exhilaration of business. For this purpose, the vague set concept can be used as an important tool which can assist in the identification of hesitated item. The vague set theory with its two membership function provides more intuitive way to interact with the vague situation that causes the hesitation for any item.

The present experiment was carried out to compare methane production and energy metabolism in crossbred cattle and buffaloes fed on 3 different total mixed ration (TMR) having various concentrate to roughage ratios. Crossbred cattle (6) and buffaloes (6), 2-year-old, were randomly divided into 3 homogenous groups following 3\u00d7 3 switch over design. Experimental feeding consisted of 3 ratio of concentrate (C) and roughage (R)((20C: 80R (T1); 50C: 50R (T2) and 80C: 20R (T3)) fed as TMR alternately to each group. After every 21 days of feeding trial, energy metabolism and methane production was determined using open circuit respiration chamber. Methane emission (L/day/kg W0. 75) was significantly higher in buffaloes (2.61\u00b10.039) as compared to crossbred cattle (2.13\u00b10.050). Methane emission (L/day) and methane energy (kcal/day) was significantly higher in buffaloes as compared to crossbred cattle. Methane emission (L/day and L/day/kg W 0.75) and methane energy (kcal/day) was significantly higher in T1 than T2 and T3. This may lead to the conclusion that buffalo produces more methane than cattle. Under the high plane of nutrition there is significant reduction in methane production than that of lower plane of nutrition in both species of animals. However, efficiency of energy utilization is significantly higher in buffaloes as compared to crossbred cattle. Though, higher concentrate to roughage ratio in the diet of CB cattle and buffaloes significantly reduces enteric CH4 emissions.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Automatic Methods for Human Embryo Component Extraction\n", "abstract": " In this thesis, we proposed two novel methods for blastomere extraction and trophectoderm segmentation in an attempt to aid physicians in determining embryo\u2019s viability. Accurate assessment of embryo\u2019s viability can play a vital role towards optimization of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment outcomes. The first proposed automatic method is developed to identify blastomeres in human embryo HMC (Hoffman Modulation Contrast) images of day-1 to day-2. Our algorithm applies isoperimetric graph partitioning, followed by a novel region merging algorithm to approximate blastomeres positions. Ellipsoidal models are then used to approximate the shape and the size of each blastomere. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a dataset of 40 embryo images and it exhibits an average blastomere extraction accuracy of 80%. The second method segments Trophectoderm (TE) regions in embryos of day-5 (also known as blastocysts) by first eliminating the inhomogeneities of the blastocysts surface using Retinex theory. A level set algorithm is then used to segment TE regions. We have tested our method on a dataset of 85 images and have achieved a segmentation accuracy of 85% for grade A, 89% for grade B and 92% for grade C.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Implementation of Interpolation algorithm in FPGA for Fine Frequency Accuracy\n", "abstract": " In today EW scenario the Radar features are getting advanced day by day. To intercept and analyse signals coming from such Radar, ESM receivers also should have modern and advanced features and techniques. There are many ESM Receivers developed/being developed based on Analog and Digital techniques to measure the intercepted Radar signal parameters. Frequency of the signal is one of the important basic parameter measured by ESM Receiver. Better frequency resolution and accuracy are desirable specifications of the receiver. Systems based on Digital Receiver are sampled signal systems. By means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, Frequencies of intercepted signals can be estimated from their locations in the discrete spectrum with a resolution depending on the number of points of FFT. But computational or other limitations often restrict the number of points, which correspondingly restricts the resolution of the estimate provided by the FFT. This paper brings out implementation of interpolation algorithm in FPGA for fine Frequency accuracy without increasing the FFT size.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The use of a limited number of piles, may improve both the ultimate load carrying capacity, and the settlement and differential settlement. The analysis of piled raft is a complex problem. The present study is focused on the experimental investigation on performance of piled raft foundation on sand. Wooden rafts of different sizes with wooden piles (single or double) of three different diameters and lengths have been used. It is observed that the load carrying capacity increases considerably when the load is transferred to the soil through raft and pile combined while the settlement per unit load is quite less. The experimental results show that number of piles below the rafts and its locations play vital role in improving the load carrying capacity of the piled raft and settlement of the soil.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}

METHODS: To evaluate the antioxidant and radioprotective activities of hydroxyectoine, nitric oxide radicals neutralizing, hydroxyl radicals scavenging, superoxide radicals scavenging, DPPH reducing assay, and protein radioprotection assays with native PAGE analysis was carried out. RESULTS: Results of the study were demonstrated that hydroxyectoine exhibited nitric oxide radicals scavenging activity (12.23\u00b13.215488%). OH-radicals scavenging efficacy of hydroxyectoine was estimated in terms of% inhibition in deoxy D-ribose degradation by non-site-specific assay. The maximum (16.2\u00b12.07869855%) inhibition of deoxy D-ribose degradation was observed in non-sitespecific manner, at 5.0 \u00b5g/ml concentration of hydroxyectoine. DPPH assay was carried out to evaluate the electron donation potential of hydroxyectoine. Maximum~ 31.17% reduction in DPPH was observed at 500 \u00b5g/ml concentration of hydroxyectoine. Similarly, maximum (14.98%) hydroxyectoine mediated inhibition in superoxide radicals concentration was observed at 400\u00b5g/ml concentration. Significantly high degree of hydroxyectoine mediated protection to BSA was observed against ionizing radiation (1000-2000Gy).CONCLUSION: In view of the observations, it can be concluded that hydroxyectoine possesses strong antioxidative and radioprotective activities and may be a potential candidate for radioprotection to cellular proteins in future.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}
{"title": "Speech Recognition Based System to Control Electrical Appliances\n", "abstract": " Speech is one of the natural forms of communication. Recent development has made it possible to use this in the security system and controlling the devices. In speech recognition, the task is to use a speech sample to select the identity of the person that produced the speech from among a population of speakers. An important pre-processing step in Automatic Speech Recognition systems is to detect the presence of noise. It has been shown that accurate speech endpoint detection improves the isolated word recognition accuracy. Also, proper location of regions of speech reduces the amount of processing. This aspect is also important for mobile telephony. Sensitivity to speech variability, inadequate recognition accuracy, and susceptibility to impersonation are among the main technical hurdles that prevent the widespread adoption of speech-based recognition systems. Speech recognition systems work reasonably well with a quiet background but poorly under noisy conditions or in distorted channels. Such a mismatch in the training and testing has severely limited. The objective of this algorithm is the development of signal processing and analysis techniques that would provide sharply improved speech recognition accuracy in any type of noisy environments. Speech is a natural medium of communication for humans, and in the last decade various speech technologies like automatic speech recognition (ASR), Voice response systems and another similar system have considerably matured. The above systems rely on the clarity of the captured speech but many of the real-world environments include noise and reverberation that mitigate the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The elastic part of the stress-strain curve is described by means of an effective modulus of elasticity which is obtained by using the strain energy stored in the plate. During the partly plastic range, perforated plate response has been found to be governed essentially by the remaining elastic portion and consequently appears as part of the elastic behavior. Beyond global yield point, the material is nearly perfectly plastic for a large range of strains and upper and lower limits of collapse load are calculated by using upper and lower-bound techniques for a perfectly plastic material.

Treatment consists of IV antibiotics, debridement and external fixator. Judicious selection of the patients on basis of Gustilio and Anderson classification leads to external fixator as a definitive and single stage procedure with dynamization. It reduces the risk of infection at time of definitive procedure and number of hospital stay and surgery. Methods: In school of medical sciences and research, We treated 68 patients with open both bone fracture (Gustilio and Anderson type 2 and 3b) with debridement and external fixator. All patients underwent dynamization depending upon fracture pattern. Majority of our cases were road traffic accident involving male. Average duration of union was 22 to 26 weeks. There was no need for any major plastic surgery procedure. Removal of external fixator and Patellar tendon brace (PTB) was given for the period of 4 to 6 weeks at the time of clinical and radiological union. Results: Eighty eight percent of our cases united well. This reduces the burden of secondary definitive procedure, infection and cost of treatment. So careful selection of the patients and dynamization of external fixator hold the place for definitive surgical option for open both bone fractures.Conclusions: External fixator is simple effective surgical procedure for open fractures both bone leg.

The experiments have been carried out in the temperature range from 5 to 300 K using monochromatic light and lasers as optical stimuli. The experiments reveal novel insights about QD PL intensity limiting, photonic doping of quantized soft matter, ie of QDs in solution, and magneto-optical effects achieved with magnetic flux densities below 1 T. We show that, as charge carrier transport in nanowires, the emission of QDs inherently possesses a square root limitation as a function of the impinging optical stimulus and that two-photon excitation of QDs can be", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Nephromegaly is a rare presentation of childhood ALL with hepatic mass being even rarer. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 3 year-old child with unilateral renal mass and hepatic mass lesion with normal blood counts, initially suspected to have metastatic Wilms tumor based on clinical, radiological and WT1 positivity on immunocytochemistry of renal mass. He was later diagnosed as ALL with peripheral blood flowcytometry and bone marrow examination. DISCUSSION: Renomegaly at presentation of acute leukemia is not necessarily due to leukemic infiltration and rarely leads to renal impairment. The radiological differential of such a renal mass includes both benign and malignant entities including metastasis. Over-expression of WT1 mRNA has been found in a number of solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is far from being diagnostic of Wilms tumor. Again, a small number of children with acute leukemia may have a deceptively normal complete blood count at presentation. Though, initial all (clinical, radiological, hematological, and immunocytological) parameters pointed towards a diagnosis of Wilms tumor in our case, the subsequent development of thrombocytopenia and lymphocytic leukocytosis prompted further investigation and final diagnosis of ALL. CONCLUSION: WT1 positivity is a known phenomenon in childhood ALL and undifferentiated lymphoblasts may be positive for WT1 and negative for Leucocyte common antigen.

A data set of 1431 acceleration time histories recorded on sites A, B, C, and D class from Japan (K-net) have been used in this study. The software EQK_SRC_PARA (Kumar et al., 2012) has been used to estimate the spectral parameters namely corner frequency (fc) above which spectrum decays with a rate of 2, the high-cut frequency (fmax) above which the spectrum again decays and the rate of decay (p) above fmax. In earlier studies by Kumar et al.,(2011, 2013a, b and 2014a, b) the dependence of fmax have been found independent from focal depths, epicentral distances and recording sites conditions. The fmax and fc showed almost similar dependency to seismic moments or magnitudes which shows fmax is also due to source process. At different recording sites, the observed values of fmax show consistent increase with seismic moment/magnitudes, which reflects that the source is the main controlling factor rather than recording site conditions.

Ambient backscatter communication solves this problem by leveraging existing TV and cellular transmissions, rather than generating their own radio waves. This novel technique enables ubiquitous communication where devices can communicate among themselves at unprecedented scales and in locations that were previously inaccessible.Ambient Backscatter transforms existing wireless signals into both a source of power and a communication medium. It enables two battery-free devices to communicate by backscattering existing wireless signals. Backscatter communication is orders of magnitude more power-efficient than traditional radio communication. Further, since it leverages the ambient RF signals that are already around us, it does not require a dedicated power infrastructure as in RFID.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The analytical solution of the eigen-value problem is obtained by using the trigonometric series method, when the gap between the cylinders is narrow. The numerical values of the critical wave number and critical Taylor number are computed from the obtained analytical expressions for the first, second and third approximations. It is found that the difference between the numerical values of the critical Taylor number corresponding to the second and third approximations are very small as compared to the difference between first and second approximations. The critical Taylor numbers obtained by the third approximation agree very well with the earlier results computed numerically by using the shooting method. This clearly indicates that for the better result one should obtain the numerical values by taking more approximations.

{"title": "Molecular events during flower induction in mango\n", "abstract": " Flowering and fruit set are the most critical of all events occurring after establishment of a tree crop. Under favourable growth conditions, the time and quantum of flowering greatly determines the yield during a given season. Floral induction is of vital importance from a practical viewpoint, particularly for cultivated fruit trees, because it determines to a considerable extent the success of commercial orchards by its influence on fruit quantity and quality. Floral induction in mature fruit trees constitutes a morphogenetic transition of stem cells in apical, as well as lateral central meristems into differentiated floral cells. This transition implies the activation and transcription of a great number of genes. Considerable advances have been made recently in deciphering the molecular genetic mechanisms that result in the morphogenetic transition from vegetative to a reproductive stage. This progress has only been possible through the use of a few model plants, like Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis and the obtained basic results with these plants can obviously be applied to many annual/biennial plants. However, whether this emerging molecular-genetic model can fully explain recent experimental results obtained for floral induction in perennial plants, particularly angiosperm trees, seems doubtful.This regulation of floral induction is significantly different in perennial compared to annual/biennial plants insofar as the floral promoter in annual/biennial plants induces all the above-ground meristems to flower in the same season, whereas in perennial plants a sophisticated regulatory system consisting", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

First in the study, the Kaiser Window function parameters used many application was found with GA. This values obtained were used in FIR filter design A method for developing VFD filters is also an essential technique for the fractional linear discrete-time systems. Theoretically speaking, the design of variable digital filters under optimal sense is more complicated and difficult than the design of fixed delay filters, since the impulse response or the poles and zeros of the filters are some type of functions in the variable parameter are generally assumed to be polynomial functions. Therefore sub optimal approaches for the design of variable digital filters should be investigated for the purpose of reducing the computation complexity. Recently advances have been made on the design of some type of VFD filters, such as finite-impulse response (FIR) VFD filters and infinite-impulse response (IIR) all pass VFD filters. Large numbers of coefficients should be designed; related iteration algorithms still feature considerable computation complexity. Examples illustrate our proposed method and Comparisons, to various earlier designs show a reduction of the arithmetic complexity.

Theoretically speaking, the design of variable digital filters under optimal sense is more complicated and difficult than the design of fixed delay filters, since the impulse response or the poles and zeros of the filters are some type of functions in the variable parameter are generally assumed to be polynomial functions. Therefore sub optimal approaches for the design of variable digital filters should be investigated for the purpose of reducing the computation complexity. For instance the twostage approach, ie designing a set of fixed-coefficient filters and then fitting each of the coefficients as polynomials has been proposed. Recently advances have been made on the design of some type of VFD filters, such as finite-impulse response (FIR) VFD filters and infinite-impulse response (IIR) all pass VFD filters\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

If the resources could be used concurrently, end user experience can be greatly improved. The recent studies in MPTCP suggest that improved reliability, load balancing and mobility are feasible. The thesis presents a new multipath delay based algorithm, MPPERT (Multipath Probabilistic Early response TCP), which provides high throughput and efficient load balancing. In all-PERT environment, MPPERT suffers no packet loss and maintains much smaller queue sizes compared to existing MPTCP, making it suitable for real time data transfer.

At molecular level cold-regulated genes are known to play an important role in conferring cold tolerance in plants. In this study, for the first time we have cloned a cold acclimation specific (CAS) gene TRICAS15, from the cold tolerant ecotype of white clover using degenerate gene specific primers. TRICAS15 ORF was 474bp long and encoded for 16.3 kD protein which contained 15 amino acid long motifs present in tandem. It showed homology with the CAS15 genes of different species of leguminosae. Phylogeny analysis revealed that CAS genes found in different species of leguminosae might have evolved from a basic gene and diverged during course of evolution. Expression of TRICAS15 fluctuated during the course of cold treatment and appeared to be specific to cold. Further, at the structural level TRICAS15 polypeptide was similar to dehydrins and might be performing similar functions during cold stress.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The alarming rate at which the incidence of bacterial resistance to known antibiotics has been rising is a serious cause of concern. At present, the two well known anti-tuberculosis drugs, isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH, isoniazid) and pyrazinamide (PZA, pyrazin-2-carboxamide) which are important components of the current course of the first-line TB chemotherapy suffer from increasing bacterial resistance. The other drugs of the combination therapy include rifampicin and ethambutol. It may be noted that both INH and PZA are prodrugs and require specific enzymes to convert them into drugs. INH is activated by a bacterial heme enzyme catalase peroxidase (MtCP) into a free radical form (Scheme I)(Zhang et al., 1992). The structure of unliganded MtCP is known (Bertrand et al., 2004) and detailed information is available about the substrate-binding site and the residues that might be involved in the binding and conversion of INH into a beneficial product. However, a precise mode of binding and the mechanism of action are not yet clearly understood because the structure of INH bound MtCP is not yet determined. On the other hand, PZA is metabolized into its active form pyrazinoic acid (POA) by amidase activity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase (PncA)(Scheme II)(Konno et al., 1967). Although the crystal structure of pyrazinamidase in complex with POA is known but the structure of the complex with the original compound PZA is not yet determined.

Based on the ultrasound image, the following steps are performed. 1) Ultrasound image is preprocessed to reduce the speckle noise. 2) The region of interest is extracted from the original image. 3) The image containing lateral ventricles and cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) is segmented. 4) Lateral ventricles and CSP are labeled. 5) Morphological operations are done to smooth the boundaries of lateral ventricles and to fill the cavities. 6) Lateral ventricle width is measured by means of the proposed image processing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Soil management through tillage can further optimize their use efficiencies. A long term experiment was initiated in 2001 to quantify the integrated plant nutrient-water-tillage interactions in Rice-Wheat and Maize-Wheat cropping systems. The treatments consisted of two tillage, three water regimes and twelve nutrient levels.

{"title": "Intensive Agriculture and Precision Farming for Poverty Alleviation in India.\n", "abstract": " The agriculture sector in India contributes 22 per cent of the total GDP and provides livelihood support to 59 per cent of country's population. The small size of land holdings and the primitive agricultural practices, especially in the resource poor rainfed areas, are the main reasons for low farm income. About 60 per cent farmers have land holding of less than 1 ha and another 20 per cent have 1 to 2 ha. A typical Indian farmer is a resource poor, hard working, God fearing, having little formal education, rich in traditional knowledge, has least risk bearing capacity and considers land as his mother. In recent years, India has seen a remarkable growth in the service sector, benefiting mostly the urban population, but this sector cannot absorb the vast rural population of more than 650 million people. Therefore, agriculture will continue to be their main livelihood vocation. Aware of this scenario, the Indian farmer is keen to adopt modern technology, knowing fully well that he has no other way to dislodge his poverty. The remarkable success of the Green Revolution model of intensive agriculture in India is well known, the world over, and has significantly helped the country to become food self-sufficient. Yet, this model has failed to benefit the resource poor rainfed areas that accounts for about 65 per cent of the total cultivated land. These are also the pockets of poverty. Intensive agriculture, coupled with precision farming, can vastly improve the farm income of small farm holders but these technologies are not being used extensively.

{"title": "Effect of modeling of super-structure on the behaviour of reactor building raft\n", "abstract": " The behaviour of the reactor building raft was studied when the stiffness of the super-structural elements is included in the analysis as compared to the results of conventional analysis ignoring the stiffness of the super-structural elements. The effect of the stiffness of the super-structures on the loss of contact of the raft under seismic environment was also investigated. In order to study the effect of horizontal springs on the behaviour of the raft particularly near the stressing gallery under seismic environment, a separate study has been carried out considering a 3D model consisting of solid elements supported on both horizontal and vertical springs. The model was analysed for all the forces applied at the top of the raft and the analysis results were compared with those of shell model. The following conclusions are drawn: (i) Idealisation of the reactor building raft using shell elements is adequate for estimating the design forces/moments on the raft. The design forces/moments obtained from FE model consisting of solid elements closely matches with those obtained from FE model with shell elements. Idealisation of the RB raft using shell elements will also reduce the problem size and the related computational efforts.

Ladle furnace is a key unit for meeting the above objectives during secondary steelmaking linked to the continuous casting process. Therefore, accurate control of process parameters during ladle processing of steel is essential. To address this challenging demand, ladle furnace on-line reckoner (LFOR) was developed. The LFOR is a model based advisory system for prediction and control of temperature and chemistry in the ladle furnace. The thermal and chemistry models use approaches based on both simplified physics as well as semi-statistical methods. Both the models were tuned and validated with the plant data. This paper describes the development of the two models of the LFOR.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}
{"title": "A novel method of mining for underground winning of contiguous sections of a coal seam under fragile parting\n", "abstract": " Extraction of clean coal from thick and contiguous seams/sections is a major problem for mining engineers. Coal mining industry of the country needs a suitable technology for extraction of the same in the presence of weak and laminated parting in between.  An idea of underpinning was conceived to facilitate safe and optimal exploitation of coal from contiguous seams/sections, which involved conventional system of development of the sections of seam along floor with superimposed pillars.  Underpinning consolidated parting stability through reinforcement and provided additional thickness to the critical parting as the roof coal band of the thick bottom section is stitched together with the parting.  The technology was experimented at Zero seam of Chirimiri colliery underneath Bartunga  hill of SECL Here, the Zero seam of over 12m  thickness was found in two sections, 3.0m top and 6.0 m bottom with the 3.5m thick parting between the two sections.  The 3.0 m thick and laminated parting, comprised alternate layers of shale, carbonaceous shale, coal and mudstone, found incompetent for safe and clean working of both the sections.  Both top and bottom sections were developed along floor using roof bolts.  The weak parting and the roof coal band of the bottom section was reinforced simultaneously by underpinning to strengthen the parting as well as to facilitate extraction of bottom section roof coal.  Pillars were extracted by splitting and slicing.  The slices of bottom section were supported by conventional props, roof bolting in addition to the reinforced roof coal band and parting by underpinning.

The inhibition efficiencies calculated from weight loss data, were Sound to be a function of concentration of inhibitors, temperature and position of the nitro group present in the benzoic acid. In the case of all nitro benzoic acids inhibition efficiency increases upto 0.5% concentration and above this concentration it decreases sluggishly. Energy of activation follows similar trends as it was observed for inhibition efficiency with concentration and temperatures. For each inhibitor different slopes of Langmuir adsorption plot were observed. Equally affected anodic and cathodic curves in the presence of studied compounds reveal the fact that they are mixed inhibitors.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

A young (0-12h old) female mated with 0-12h old male, Binodoxys indicus produces 131.6\u00b18.08 progeny within 4 days of life. However, older female mated with older male (both 96-108 h old) yields only 89.0\u00b112.54 progeny. The progeny sex ratio (proportion of males) is female-biased (0.36\u00b1. 03) when the parents were younger (0-12h old) but is male\u00b7 biased (0.59\u00b10.06) when the parents were older (96-108h old). Therefore, it implies that most of the daughters are produced during earlier phase of reproduction. The analysis of the data shows that only maternal age at copulation influences the total births significantly while both maternal as well as paternal age during copulation influence the progeny sex ratio. The implication of these results is discussed with reference to the maximisation of yield of total births as well as the female births for mass propagation and field release of the parasitoids in biocontrol programmes.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The rate of formation of 2 in liposomes is approximately 5-6 times slower as compared to the rate in aqueous buffer (phosphate, berate and NaCl-NaOH) depending on pH of the medium. As compared to organic homogeneous media of n-hexane or aprotic acetonitrile, in liposome the rate of formation of 2 is faster.:tn protic methanol, however, the schiff base 2 is formed with almost the same efficiency as it is formed in liposome (phosphate buffer, pH 12). While the schiff base 2 undergoes rapid hydrolysis in aqueous buffer, it remains stable in liposomal matrix in the dark. Rapid chromophoric destruction of liposomal-2 is observed under UV irradiation. Addition of organic acids to liposome constituted 2 causes its protonation yielding the corresponding all-trans-N-retinylidene-n-butylammonium salt 3. The stability of 3 in liposomal environment is influenced by the type of counter anion. Among all the anions (trifluoroacetate, trichloroacetate, dichloroacetate, chloroacetate, chloropropionate and propionate) studied, trifluoroacetate anion is most effective in stabilising 3. It has been found that liposomes can provide microenvironment necessary for solubilisation and stabilisation of retinal schiff bases as desired in biological applications. The formation and stability of 2 have been discussed in terms of general mechanism involving a common tetrahedral intermediate.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

{"title": "Radiation processes for the control of NOx/SO2 emissions\n", "abstract": " [en] This report provides a brief review of the use of radiation for the treatment of flue gases and identifies areas for additional research. Two different radiation-based processes have been developed for the removal of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide from the flue gases of coal-fired boilers. In the technique developed by the Ebara Corporation and Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, ammonia is injected prior to the irradiation step to enhance the process efficiency and to yield a solid ammonium sulphate-ammonium nitrate product that may be used as a fertilizer. The process developed by the Research-Cottrell Corporation uses electron-beam irradiation downstream of a lime spray dryer to remove nitrogen oxides and to enhance the sulphur dioxide removal efficiency. Both of these processes require large quantities of electron-beam power and are currently expected to be more expensive than other available sulphur dioxide emission control technologies. Present emission control regulations in North America do not require the high degree of nitrogen oxide removal provided by the radiation-based processes. Research into the radiolytic oxidation of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide, the radiolytic oxidation of NO x/SO 2 on solid sorbents, and the radiolytic oxidation of NO x/SO 2 in electric fields may lead to the development of more economical radiation treatment processes for flue gases. 44 refs", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

The oxidation rate is described by equations which are first-order relative to bromamine-T, the alcohol,(H/sup+/), and (Ru (III)). The reactions are retarded by Cl/sup-/ions, although the rate is practically independent of the concentration of p-toluene-sulfamide and ionic strength. From the temperature dependence we have calculated the activation energy and entropy. We propose an oxidation mechanism including formation of an intermediate complex of Ru (III) with bromamine-T.

Pusa chickney and a legume, Cicer arietinum cv. T-3. Marked enhancements in chlorophyll development and Hill activity were induced by direct chilling of seedlings prior to their exposure to light and in light grown seedlings by preplanting chilling treatment to seeds. There was no significant change in the ratio of Chi. a and b.Our earlier reports have indicated that pre-sowing chilling treatment induces enhancement in branching/tillering, yield and nutrient status in several non-vernalization requiring crops (Banerji and Kaushal, 1980; Singh, 1982, 1984a; Singh and Banerji, 1983). It was therefore, of interest to learn the possible biochemical changes which may occur during chilling treatment and which could underlie its subsequent growth effects. This paper reports the enhancement in chlorophyll development in legume seedlings during chilling and in foliaceous cotyledons of a cucurbit seedlings, due to seed chilling and promotion in Hill activity in seedling leaf due to seed chilling in a legume.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}

Calculations of the excitation efficiency in both the cases are presented for various dielectric constants and the normalized dimensions of the launchers.

The ovules excised from 35-40 day-old open-pollinated fruitlets of Amrapali cultivar were utilized for validation/standardization of in vitro in-ovulo embryo culture conditions. The medium comprising of B5 (macro) + MS (micro + organics) with sucrose (50 g 1-1 ), casein hydrolysate (200 mg 1-1 ), L-glutamine (200 mg 1-1 ), IAA (0.5 mg 1- 1 ) and BAP (2.0 mg 1-1 ) at pH 5.7\u00b10.1 under complete dark condition showed better establishment and maturation of young embryos. Similarly, germination of matured embryos was best on medium comprising of B5 (macro) + MS (micro + organics) supplemented with sucrose (30 g 1-1 ), casein hydrolysate (200 mg 1-1 ), L-glutamine (100 mg 1-1 ), BAP (1.0 mg 1 -1 ), GA3 (1.0 mg 1-1 ) under 12/12 h light and dark cycle.

Emission intensity versus effective emissive area, number of CNTs present in the film contributing emission process and number density of MWCNTs at high field (during FE process) along with other FE parameters viz. turn on field, threshold field are determined, which agrees well with experimental results. Over estimation of calculated value over experimental results is realized with creation of new emission sites at high electric field due to combined effect of divergence of electron within electrode because of electron-air molecule collision, assumption of evenly placement of emitters during calculation, damages and/or tearoff of emitters at high electric field, contribution of adsorbates of MWCNT walls and the energy loss due to absorption of phosphor atom. This analysis renders a unique way to analyze field emission data and supports the theoretical formulation to evaluate the best possible values of FE parameters.

This paper seeks to contribute to the debate whether this is possible and to identify research needs to increase crop water productivity such that food security can be ensured and farmer\u2019s livelihood enhanced without increasing water diverted for agriculture over that in 2000.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}
{"title": "Brain4Cars: Sensory-Fusion Recurrent Neural Models for Driver Activity Anticipation\n", "abstract": " Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have made driving safer over the last decade. They prepare vehicles for unsafe road conditions and alert drivers if they perform a dangerous maneuver. However, many accidents are unavoidable because by the time drivers are alerted, it is already too late. Anticipating maneuvers beforehand can alert drivers before they perform the maneuver and also give ADAS more time to avoid or prepare for the danger. In this work we anticipate driving maneuvers several seconds before they occur [2]. For this purpose we build a vehicular-sensory platform with multiple cameras, tactile sensors, GPS, and a computing device. Our sensors capture the driving context from both inside and outside of the car. We introduce a sensoryfusion Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture which jointly learns to anticipate and fuse information from multiple sensory streams. Our architecture use Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) units to capture long temporal dependencies. We evaluate our approach on a diverse data set with 1180 miles of natural free-way and city driving and show that we can anticipate maneuvers 3.5 seconds before they occur with over 80% F1-score in real-time. 1", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["882"]}
