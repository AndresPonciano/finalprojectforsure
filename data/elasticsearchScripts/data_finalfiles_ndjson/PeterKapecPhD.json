{"title": "Exploring visual attention and saliency modeling for task-based visual analysis\n", "abstract": " Memory, visual attention and perception play a critical role in the design of visualizations. The way users observe a visualization is affected by salient stimuli in a scene as well as by domain knowledge, interest, and the task. While recent saliency models manage to predict the users\u2019 visual attention in visualizations during exploratory analysis, there is little evidence how much influence bottom-up saliency has on task-based visual analysis. Therefore, we performed an eye-tracking study with 47 users to determine the users\u2019 path of attention when solving three low-level analytical tasks using 30 different charts from the MASSVIS database [1]. We also compared our task-based eye tracking data to the data from the original memorability experiment by Borkin et\u00a0al. [2]. We found that solving a task leads to more consistent viewing patterns compared to exploratory visual analysis. However, bottom-up saliency of a\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["956"]}
{"title": "Visualizing software artifacts using hypergraphs\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present an alternative software visualization approach that is based on hypergraphs. Hypergraphs are used in all steps of the visualization process--as a data model for representing software artifacts, trough a query mechanism based on hypergraphs up to the visualization level where we utilize interactive well known 3D graph visualizations methods. The proposed visualization aims to provide a visual programming environment for software developers. We also present visualizations of existing software projects.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["956"]}

{"title": "Decision Support in Medical Data Using 3D Decision Tree Visualisation\n", "abstract": " Decision making is a difficult task, especially in the medical domain. Decision trees are among the most often used supervised machine learning algorithms, primarily due to their straightforward interpretation through rules, they are composed of. Visualizations of decision trees can help with the understanding of data and decision rules on top of them. This paper proposes a 3D decision tree visualization method that allows effective decision tree exploration and help with decision tree interpretation. The main contribution of this visualization is the ability to display global tree structure and the difference in the distributions of values between subsets created by individual decision nodes. The approach is evaluated using a design study on a typical medical dataset and on a synthetic dataset with controlled properties. It shows the visualization's ability to display individual components of the decision rule and the ability to\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["956"]}

{"title": "Visual access to graph content using magic lenses and filtering\n", "abstract": " Graph visualization is a large and still evolving problem area in which new approaches appear. Graphs are often used to represent information that contains relations among data. Visual presentation of graphs aims at better graphs comprehension, however one problem in graph visualization is still present: how to effectively access the information stored in nodes and/or edges of graph. In this paper, we present our approach for visual accessing of graph content by using visual nodes. We also present how a hyper-graph based query language can be used in conjunction with magic lenses to lower visual clutter.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["956"]}
{"title": "Knowledge-based software representation, querying and visualization\n", "abstract": " Among various data types that can be visualized, recently software became one of the most important candidate for visualization. With the increasing complexity of developed software systems the need for better means to understand software are needed. Software visualization aims to help with these problems by providing graphical presentations and thus allows discussion between developers in the domain of these graphical representations rather than mental concepts. In this work we presents an alternative software visualization method based on hypergraphs. We have developed a visualization system that utilize hypergraph-based representation of software artifacts and relations between them. We present how hypergraphs can be used in all stages of the visualization process and how they are used as the unifying data representation. Interactive 3D visualization displays directly these hypergraph representations of software. To allow filtering we have developed a query mechanism in which queries are hypergraph patterns and results are also hypergraphs. This way the visualization system is build around only one data structure.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["956"]}
{"title": "Hypergraph-based software visualization\n", "abstract": " In this paper an alternative approach to software visualization is presented based on hypergraph representation of software artifacts. Our approach builds upon known techniques that rely on graphs for visualization.

Our aim is to create a unified graphical environment that is capable to visualize relations between various levels of software artifacts, ranging from source code up to the project management tasks.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["956"]}
{"title": "Visual programming environment based on hypergraph representations\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present a concept of a visual programming environment that uses hypergraphs for representing, querying and visualizing software artifacts. The hypergraph representation allows to store semantic relations between software artifacts an can be visualized with well-known graph drawing algorithms. The proposed visual programming environment focuses not only on software visualization, but also offers context visualization for programming tasks.

{"title": "Exploring 3D GPU-accelerated graph visualization with time-traveling virtual camera\n", "abstract": " Graph visualization is an ongoing research area with many open problems. Graphs are often visualized in 2D space and recently also 3D visualizations emerge. However, the added third dimension adds additional problems that make the graph comprehension more difficult. In this paper we focus on navigating and exploring 3D graph visualizations. We present our approach for the automation of virtual camera movement for better graph exploration. This camera movement is enhanced with experimental exploration recording and play-back that allows to fork exploration paths at any time and to switch between them. We also present how graph layout can be accelerated with GPU in combination with scene graph structures. These features were added into our graph visualization system that we use for software visualization. We present several visualizations of the structure and the evolution of software systems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["956"]}
