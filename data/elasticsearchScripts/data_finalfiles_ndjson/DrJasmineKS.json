{"title": "Cost estimation model for reuse based software products\n", "abstract": " A fundamental task when employing software reuse is evaluating its impacts by measuring the relation of reused and developed software, the cost for obtaining reuse and the cost avoided by reusing software during development and maintenance. Different reuse related metrics exist in the literature, varying from strictly code-based metrics, aiming to measure the amount of code reused in a product, to more elaborate cost-based metrics and models, aiming to measure the costs involved in reuse programs and to evaluate the impacts of reuse in software development. The goal of this work is to evaluate the current state of the art on the reuse metrics area, with a special emphasis on reuse cost metrics and propose an estimation model for development cost by surveying hundred software companies.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["2215"]}

Different approaches come to the market and try to address existing needs, but up to day no global solution exists. The proposed system would enhance the P2P (SMS Based) mobile Payment system, which will try to ease the money transfer between two individual. This solution the key difference is the time needed to inform the beneficiary about the completion of the payment. The advantage of such a system is that only the mobile phone number, not the bank account number or credit card details, are transmitted. Moreover, consumers can even request a proposed system's phone number if they do not feel comfortable giving their mobile phone number to merchants. Therefore, proposed system tries to improve the customer's trust and payment security.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2215"]}
{"title": "A new capability maturity model for reuse based software development process\n", "abstract": " For any industrial organizations, improving the business performance often means the improvement in their software development performance. The growing popularity of developing the software using reusable components could dramatically reduce development effort, cost and accelerate delivery. To achieve this goal it is necessary to define a systematic reuse strategy as part of organization daily activities. Often, gains in product quality, productivity, cost reduction, cycle time reduction, and even customer satisfaction are offered to corporate decision-makers to justify investment in adoption of the CMMI. This paper provides an approach and mechanisms for making CMMI investment decisions based on impact on ROI by proposing a new process based capability maturity model for reuse based development process.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2215"]}
{"title": "DRE\u2013A Quality Metric for Component based Software Products\n", "abstract": " The overriding goal of software engineering is to provide a high quality system, application or a product. To achieve this goal, software engineers must apply effective methods coupled with modern tools within the context of a mature software process [2]. In addition, it is also must to assure that high quality is realized. Although many quality measures can be collected at the project levels, the important measures are errors and defects. Deriving a quality measure for reusable components has proven to be challenging task now a days. The results obtained from the study are based on the empirical evidence of reuse practices, as emerged from the analysis of industrial projects. Both large and small companies, working in a variety of business domains, and using object-oriented and procedural development approaches contributed towards this study. This paper proposes a quality metric that provides benefit at both project and process level, namely defect removal efficiency (DRE).", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["2215"]}
{"title": "A new process model for reuse based software development approach\n", "abstract": " Software reuse enables developers to leverage past accomplishments and facilitates significant improvements in software productivity and quality [1]. The contribution of this paper is a recommended process model for the implementation of software reuse effectively. A critical problem in today\u2019s practice of software reuse is the lack of a standard process model which describes the necessary details to support reuse based software development and evolution. Our research thesis is that software development based upon a reuse-based process model improves quality of products and productivity of processes. A quantitative survey of 100 software organizations is used to test the new process model and the hypothesis of the study. The process model presented in this paper identifies process level, organizational and technical aspects which have to be improved to achieve success in the reuse world.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["2215"]}

{"title": "A Mixed Method Approach for Efficient Component Retrieval from a Component Repository\n", "abstract": " A continuing challenge for software designers is to develop efficient and cost-effective software implementations. Many see software reuse as a potential solution; however, the cost of reuse tends to outweigh the potential benefits. The costs of software reuse include establishing and maintaining a library of reusable components, searching for applicable components to be reused in a design, as well as adapting components toward a proper implementation. In this context, a new method is suggested here for component classification and retrieval which consists of K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and Vector space Model Approach. We found that this new approach gives a higher accuracy and precision in component selection and retrieval process compared to the existing formal approaches.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2215"]}

It is known that identifying the probability values of belief network nodes given a set of evidence is not amenable in general. Many different simulation algorithms for approximating solution to this problem have been proposed and implemented. This paper details the implementation of such algorithms, in particular the two algorithms of the belief networks namely Logic sampling and the likelihood weighing are discussed. A detailed description of the algorithm is given with observed results.

{"title": "Reengineering test management for increasing testing effectiveness in component based enterprise applications\n", "abstract": " Software reuse is widely considered as a way to increase the productivity and improve the quality and reliability of new software systems. Identifying, extracting and reengineering software components, which implement abstractions within existing systems is a promising cost-effective way to create reusable test assets. In the present scenario, one of the major problems in building large-scale enterprise systems is anticipating the performance of the eventual solution before it has been built. Testing is an important and significant part of the software development lifecycle to ensure a high quality product with a minimum number of faults. But most organizations don\u2019t have a standard process for defining, organizing, managing, and documenting their testing efforts. Often testing is conducted as an ad hoc activity, and it changes with every new product. Without a standard foundation for test planning, development, execution, and defect tracking, testing efforts are nonrepeatable, nonreusable, and difficult to measure. Reengineering the test management process can solve the problems due to unstructured, decentralized test management. This paper explains the goals of reengineering test management and how to achieve it and the approach as demonstrated, constructs useful models that act as predictors of testing effectiveness in component based enterprise applications.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2215"]}
