Two major processes are considered in detail, text parsing and text condensation with emphasis on the latter. Based on principles of semantic parsing, the text parser serves the purpose to augment the initial domain knowledge base with the knowledge encoded in a text, thus generating a specific text knowledge base. A condensation process then transforms these text representation structures into a more abstract thematic description of what the text is about, filtering out irrelevant knowledge structures and preserving only the most significant concepts. Finally, a hierarchical representation of the thematic units of the text is generated in terms of a text graph which supports variable degrees of abstraction for text summarization as well as content-oriented retrieval of text knowledge.", "num_citations": "71\n", "authors": ["593"]}

{"title": "Knowledge integration for building organizational memories\n", "abstract": " The paper starts with a discussion of the roles an organizational memory (OM) should play and what kind of knowledge should go into it. We then identify two kinds of integration problems. The rst one is concerned with integrating the knowledge bases of di erent knowledge-based systems employed in an organization into one physically or virtually uni ed knowledge base which is to be considered as part of the organization's OM. The second problem concerns the integration of several representations of the same knowledge with di erent degrees of formalization, ranging from formally represented knowledge via semi-structured text to plain text. It is argued to solve the two integration problems by making use of a high-level language whose representation ontology is explicitly de ned. Such a language is rather comprehensive, but only parts of it are used at a time and actual inferencing is done in optimized, low-level formalisms to which this language is compiled.", "num_citations": "53\n", "authors": ["593"]}

Although for illustation purposes a frame data model is used as a formal basis, the role construct can be adopted by any other data model (or knowledge representation model) which supports these facilities. The semantics of the role construct is specified by integrity constraints which cover, besides other aspects, a facility for sharing properties among roles. Operational characteristics are described with respect to the most relevant modification operations. A comparison with the various intuitive notions of roles which currently exist shows that they all can be reinterpreted in terms of the role construct and their meaning thus be made explicit.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["593"]}

Various sensor devices from the consumer market were used in addition to the usual PSG sensors in a sleep lab. An expert assigned a sleep stage for every 30 seconds. Subsequently, a sleep stage classifier was learned from the resulting sensor data streams segmented into labelled sleep stages of 30 seconds each. Apart from handcrafted features we also experimented with unsupervised feature learning based on the deep learning paradigm. Our best results for correctly classified sleep stages are in the range of 90 to 91% for Wake, REM and N3, while the best recognition rate for N2 is 83%.

{"title": "Process support for increasing participation in eParticipation\n", "abstract": " The lack of user acceptance of e-participation initiatives has been attributed to several factors, among them lack of motivation, poor transparency of process and lack of traceability of contributions. These deficits cannot be overcome by compliance with usability and accessibility guidelines. To increase user participation it is suggested to align such initiatives with the requirements of civil society groups who are more successful in mobilising public engagement and less with government requests. To enable and empower such groups to set up and maintain e-participation initiatives, a functional navigator for guiding users in configuring a platform as well as process support components are required. The latter focus on the transitions between different phases.

{"title": "A frame-based knowledge representation model and its mapping to nested relations\n", "abstract": " The first part of this paper introduces the basic constructs of a frame representation model and gives a formal definition for them. Subsequently the nested relational model (NF2) is described as an extension of the classical relational model to support relation-valued attributes. In the second part of this paper both models are compared with each other and a mapping of frame representation structures to NF2 structures is specified. The structural similarities between frames and NF2 relations are made clear and it is shown that their main difference is due to the type polymorphism introduced by the concept hierarchy of the frame model. This causes type collisions to occur in the strictly typed NF2 model when frames are directly mapped to NF2 structures. Two solutions to this problem are suggested and compared. The paper concludes with a reformulation of query operations of the frame model in terms of NF2 algebra\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["593"]}

The solution is based on real-time capture and analysis of vital data such as heart rate variability as well as activity and contextual data such as location and time of day. Individual recognition patterns for stress are derived from combining vital and contextual data by using subjective stress assessments via mood maps as additional input during an initial learning phase.

Furthermore, our BCSS framework includes components for adapting its interactions according to a user\u2019s observed behavioural preferences as well as his or her previous reactions to system interventions. User adaptation also takes into account the preferences of similar users by employing a collaborative filtering approach.

The approach derived from those requirements utilizes the concept of interaction patterns to impose some control and guidance on a collaboration process without reducing the needed flexibility. This not only causes a much greater process transparency but also allows to provide and capture knowledge within the collaboration interactions. The application-specific instantiation of the interaction patterns and their enrichment with integrity constraints is done using a model-driven approach. The resulting application model is also a knowledge artefact which represents an important fragment of domain knowledge.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["593"]}

An online survey was conducted in Austria, Germany and Switzerland to nd out managers' attitudes towards experience and if and how they capture, use and disseminate it. The results show that the majority consider experience an important asset, but do not actually support it in any systematic way. Company size and position rather than age or gender play a role when it comes to preferences, attitudes or practices. The survey shows great discrepancies between methods considered useful vs. those in regular use. Besides, there is a preference for classical people-oriented methods rather than modern IT-supported methods.

A central contribution is the calibration of HRV values to each user of the SmartCoping app. Calibration is crucial since HRV varies greatly among people and must be interpreted individually. Calibration is implemented in two variants, one which requires user feedbacks on perceived stress levels during an initial learning phase and one where no feedback is needed, and a user\u2019s maximal and minimal HRV values are determined during an initial usage phase. The variant with user feedbacks results in stress warnings which better reflect a user\u2019s stress perception. The app can be used to trigger stress warnings, identify recurrent stress situations from the history data, and give relaxation support via a biofeedback\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["593"]}

This brings the demand to create or adapt domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) efficiently and in a timely manner, which, on the contrary, is a complex and time-consuming engineering task. This is not just due to the required high expertise in both knowledge engineering and targeted domain. It is also due to the sequential approach that still characterizes the accommodation of new requirements in modeling language engineering. In this paper we present a DSML adaptation approach where agility is fostered by merging engineering phases in a single modeling environment. This is supported by ontology concepts, which are tightly coupled with DSML constructs. Hence, a modeling environment is being developed that enables a modeling language to be\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["593"]}

{"title": "Preface of the First Workshop Models in AI.\n", "abstract": " With the increasing availability of large amounts of data in practically all application areas, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been attracting increasing attention for some time now. Earlier approaches to AI were primarily associated with the knowledge-based paradigm where systems include domain-specific knowledge bases that provide the required (background) knowledge. The construction and maintenance of such domain models has to be done largely manually and therefore requires a great deal of time and money, which is why these approaches scale up poorly.The new paradigm of data-driven AI, ie learning domain models and keeping them up-to-date by using data mining techniques, can help overcome these disadvantages. The models learned may be either symbolic (eg rules, decision trees) or sub-symbolic (neural networks). Classical data mining, however, also implies considerable manual effort, in particular for feature engineering. The rise of deep learning approaches, which embed the identification of relevant features into the learning processes themselves, may well contribute further to automating the creation of AI systems. In these cases, the generated models are of a sub-symbolic nature.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["593"]}

Stress management is particularly important for high-risk populations such as former alcoholics to reduce the risk of relapse; they will therefore test and validate the solution. By combining and correlating psycho-physiological data with data on activities (eg walking or social interactions) and environment/location (eg ambient light) it is expected that sources of stress can be recognised which in turn will allow individuals to either avoid stress-inducing factors or develop appropriate coping strategies.

Such systems need various kinds of knowledge, like knowledge about the terminology underlying the corresponding domain of discourse, and knowledge about what kinds of events and actions can occur in the office work and what changes they cause. As many office tasks underlie organizational regulations as well as federal law, the value of systems for supporting office work is drastically increased if they know about these regulations, thus becoming able to ensure their obedience, or to explain them to the user (this insight already motivated the early LEGOL project [18]).

This makes it possible to provide isomorphic representations, makes maintenance of the knowledge bases much easier and less error-prone, and is a prerequisite for reusing and sharing the legal knowledge among several knowledge-based systems. We suggest a hybrid knowledge representation approach which integrates a legal representation component with the representation component of an application system by coupling them via their common terminology. This is always possible because the domains of discourse of both representation components necessarily overlap. Sometimes, such an integration does not comply with the control flow requirements of the application system.

{"title": "How to Induce Trust in Medical AI Systems\n", "abstract": " Trust is an important prerequisite for the acceptance of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, in particular in the medical domain. Explainability is currently discussed as the key approach to induce trust. Since a medical AI system is considered a medical device, it also has to be formally certified by an officially recognised agency. The paper argues that neither explainability nor certification suffice to tackle the trust problem. Instead, we propose an alternative approach aimed at showing the physician how well a patient is represented in the original training data set. We operationalize this approach by developing formal indicators and illustrate their usefulness with a real-world medical data set.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["593"]}
{"title": "The Myth of 10, 000 Steps: A New Approach to Smartphone-based Health Apps for Supporting Physical Activity.\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces an alternative approach to conventional pedometer apps which measure the wide-spread goal of 10,000 steps a day. Instead we focus on the intensity of physical activity, which is in line with recent recommendations of renowned health institutions such as the WHO. These promote a minimum of moderate to vigorous physically active time per week to achieve the desired health benefits. The paper discusses how the guidelines have been implemented. It also outlines how we help maintain user motivation over time (eg by integrating and personalising\" nudges\") and how we intend to solve the challenges posed by different fitness levels and personal lifestyles.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["593"]}
{"title": "From a data-driven towards a knowledge-driven society: making sense of data\n", "abstract": " In our four-part workshop, we will focus on data as a primary resource for our society and, with methods from soft computing, sense-making of raw data to augment human conditions for example expanding the smart city concept to a concept of cognitive cities that, in a humanistic sense, gears to human-centered computing. With this in mind, in the first part, we focus on deep learning to generate natural language descriptions of data mining results. In the second part, we concentrate on granular computing as a forceful toolbox for representing and reasoning with different types and levels of data abstraction. In part three, we demonstrate, how the previous parts are critical elements to overcome the concept of smart cities towards cognitive cities, in which opposed to many of todays smart city concepts humans are the center of development. In the fourth and last part of our workshop, we will collectively develop solutions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["593"]}
{"title": "Smart Coping with Stress: Biofeedback via Smart Phone for Stress Reduction and\n", "abstract": " The paper presents the design plan for a mobile solution aimed at stress reduction. The solution will be developed by a team of medics, psychotherapists, HCI experts and knowledge engineers and will provide continuous data sensing and feedback about personal stress levels. At the same time contextual and activity information will be captured. Stress management is particularly important for high-risk populations such as former alcoholics to reduce the risk of relapse; they will therefore test and validate the solution. By combining and correlating psycho-physiological data with data on activities (eg walking or social interactions) and environment/location (eg ambient light) it is expected that sources of stress can be recognised which in turn will allow individuals to either avoid stress-inducing factors or develop appropriate coping strategies. To make sense of the data captured, it is proposed to use intelligent algorithms to recognise patterns in the data streams and semantic technologies to interpret the text messages of users. People with other stress-related health problems such as burn-out, smoking, depression or sleeping problems will also benefit from our research.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["593"]}

{"title": "EULE2: A prototypical knowledge-based decision support system for the performance of office tasks\n", "abstract": " In Swiss Life, as in many other companies, officeworkers for customer support are no longer specialists, each one dealing with a restricted number of office tasks only, but are becoming generalists who must deal with all kinds of tasks. Office tasks underlie organisational regulations and federal law which are quite often rather complex. Therefore a decision support system which knows about the regulations and the law and which can guide a user through an office task would considerably increase quality and quantity of the office work being done 1. The knowledge-based decision support system EULE2 (cf.[RM95]) developped at Rentenanstalt/Swiss Life meets this goal. The system is still prototypical but is intended to become productive and to be used by about 150 office workers.In Section 2 we describe how EULE2 is used to perform an office task. We will identify three different kinds of knowledge that is needed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["593"]}
