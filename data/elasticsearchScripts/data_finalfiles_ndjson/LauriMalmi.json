The high level of drop out percentage has been a problem at Helsinki University of Technology for many years. This course has yearly enrolment of 500-600 students and the drop out percentage has varied from 30-50 percents. Since we did not have clear picture of drop out reasons we conducted a qualitative interview research in which 18 dropouts from the CS1 course were interviewed. The reasons of drop out were categorized and, in addition, each case was investigated individually. This procedure enabled us to both list the reasons and to reveal the cumulative nature of drop out reasons. The results indicate that several reasons affect students' decision to quit the CS1 course. The most frequent reasons were the lack of time and the lack of motivation.

While such smart content items are known to be beneficial, they are frequently offered through different login-based systems, each with its own student identification for giving credits and collecting log data. As a consequence, using more than one kind of smart learning content is rarely possible, due to overhead for both teachers and students caused by adopting and using several systems in the context of a single course. In this paper, we present a general purpose architecture for integrating multiple kinds of smart content into a single system. As a proof of this approach, we have developed the Python Grids practice system for learning Python, which integrates four kinds of smart content running on different servers across two continents. The system has been used over a whole semester in a large-scale introductory programming course to provide voluntary practice content for over 600 students. In turn, the ability to offer four kinds of content within a single system enabled us to examine the impact of using a variety of smart learning content on students\u2019 studying behavior and learning outcomes. The results show that the majority of students who used the system were engaged with all four types of content, instead of only engaging with one or two types. Moreover, accessing multiple types of content correlated with higher course performance, as compared to using only one type of content.

Using the didactic triangle as our theoretical framework we developed a typology to analyse the data and used this to categorise 89 related research papers, from all levels of education (primary, secondary and tertiary). The results suggest that students\u2019 characteristics, their understanding of the content and learning outcomes are studied frequently. In contrast, science teachers are studied much less. Most papers reported studies that had been done at the teaching organisation level. Course level studies and society level studies were also frequent. However, international level studies were few in this data pool. We conclude by discussing less popular research topics in the science education field.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["924"]}

{"title": "On updating and balancing relaxed balanced search trees in main memory\n", "abstract": " In this thesis, various methods for maintaining balanced search trees in main memory are considered. The work concentrates on algorithms applying relaxed balancing in which updates and rebalancing are uncoupled from each other. A new relaxed balanced tree, the rank-valued tree, which is a relaxed version of symmetric binary B-trees, also known as red-black trees, is introduced and analyzed. Rank-valued trees have the following benefits compared with chromatic trees, an older relaxed version of redblack trees. First, no rebalancing transformation will make the tree less balanced. Second, no rotations are needed if the tree is initially in balance. New algorithms for rebalancing relaxed balanced trees are given. The algorithm R1 rebalances a chromatic tree after M updates in O (M log (N+ M)) time and using O (N+ M) extra space, where N is the size of the initial tree. The algorithm R2 rebalances a heightvalued tree that is a relaxed AVL tree, in O (M log N) time, and it requires O (log N) extra space.A group-update operation means that a large number of records is inserted or deleted at one time. In this thesis, a new method of implementing group updates is discussed. Contrary to previous methods, in which balancing was carried out during the updates, in the new method balancing is postponed. This is important because in this way the updates are immediately accessible and there is no delay due to the rebalancing of the tree. The results imply that if M records are inserted below p leaves, denoted by r1, r2,..., rp, in an AVL tree T, the total time for performing the updates and rebalancing the tree is O (M+ log N+\u2211 p\u2212 1", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["924"]}

Recently, a new method called relaxed balancing has been proposed in which balancing and updates are uncoupled. Updates only leave balance information in the tree, thus enabling rebalancing later. In this paper, new algorithms for updating and rebalancing the tree, based on using the relaxed balance information, are given. It is shown that if M updates are performed in a red-black tree with N keys, the tree can be rebalanced in O(M log (N + M)) time. If the tree is originally empty, the rebalancing is performed in O(M) time.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["924"]}
{"title": "Identifying Missing Types of Nordic Research in Science Education\n", "abstract": " In order to get comprehensive picture of science education research and specifically identify overlooked research topics in this field, a new way to categorise research papers was developed. The new categorisation system is based on the didactic triangle, a theoretical model describing the elements of teaching-studying-learning processes, which we have extended in our work. We started with the analysis of in total 19 physics and chemistry education papers in two annual Finnish conference series revealing that students\u2019 attitudes, understandings and their learning styles, as well as teachers\u2019 pedagogical activities were well investigated areas, whereas less emphasis was put on society level studies in this data set. With the 84 papers published in NorDiNa (2005-2012) we had an opportunity to extend the view to a wider field of research in the Nordic countries, where for instance the society level studies were more frequent. Our analysis demonstrates that the developed categorisation system could be used to trace the differences and missing types of research foci in different publication forums. Moreover, the new categorisation system also supports meta-level analysis of published research papers and thus contributes to the discussion about the goals and the present state of science education research.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["924"]}

At a recent ITiCSE working group, the authors proposed an approach to classifying and assessing the significance of work in CER [3]. Defining and discussing a core literature will strengthen the CER community and facilitate the entry of new researchers. Obviously a single working group can only deal with a subset of the CER literature, and this subset will tend to represent the interests of the working group\u2019s members. Furthermore, the corpus of CER literature is far from static. Each year brings many new papers and books, each of them potentially significant.

We applied the didactic focus-based categorization analysis method (DFCM), which is based on an extension of the didactic triangle. As the data set, we used 250 papers published in the Nordic Studies in Science Education (NorDiNa) between 2005 and 2013, and the European Science Education Research Association (ESERA) 2013 conference proceedings covering education at upper secondary and tertiary levels. The results show that the teacher\u2019s pedagogical actions and the student\u2013content relationship were the most frequently studied aspects. On the other hand, teachers\u2019 reflections on the students\u2019 perceptions and attitudes about goals and content, and teachers\u2019 conceptions of the students\u2019 actions towards achieving the goals were studied least. Irrespective of the publication forum, the distributions of foci to different categories were quite similar. Our historical analysis completes the recent studies in the field as it is based on the theory driven categorization system instead of the data driven approaches used by the previous researchers. Moreover, our further observations on more recent publications suggest that no significant changes have taken place, and therefore wider discussion about the scope and the coverage of the research in science education is needed.

This paper develops a General Systems Theory based multi-layered feedback loop model, which highlights the goal oriented and self-repairing nature of the instructional processes. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of the model and illustrate how the model can be used to organize and analyze multi-faceted feedback. We use the feedback loop model to analyze an empirical data set collected from students at a university to illustrate how the model can pinpoint reasons for inefficient or challenging features of instructional processes. The results describe cases that convey engineering students\u2019 expectations and experiences of their studies providing thus feedback for teachers on their teaching. Students\u2019 also expressed thoughts on the content of the courses and how the curriculum was organized--aspects that provide feedback to both teachers and the teaching organization. The results also pinpoint to the phases of the instructional\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["924"]}
{"title": "Supervisor's perspective\n", "abstract": " SUPERVISING (OR INSTRUCTING) A DOCTORAL THESIS PROJECT is a challenging task. One helps the student by providing appropriate guidance and feedback on defining research goals and questions, as well as selecting research methods and working processes, yet at the same time working in an area that is partially beyond supervisor\u2019s own knowledge. At the same time one should support the student\u2019s growth as an independent researcher. Some interesting discussions about these issues are, for example, found in [1, 2, 6]. In this column, however, I reflect on some other challenges that may take place when supervising theses in computing education research (CER), challenges that could be interesting for supervisors or doctoral students working in computer science (CS) proper. In this piece I highlight some differences between CS and CER by briefly discussing students, research goals and methods\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["924"]}
{"title": "Tools research--what is it?\n", "abstract": " ConclusionEach course presents its own challenges and opportunities for teaching and learning. Over the years, much discussion (in print and at conferences) has been devoted to lectures, active learning, etc. The ideas presented here (multiple proofs, oral presentations, oral final exams) seem to have had less discussion, but may be of interest to teachers in a range of courses.

{"title": "Reflections on Koli Calling Conference: emergence of the Koli spirit\n", "abstract": " Koli Calling was originally launched as a meeting to shake Finnish computer science teachers' minds. Its original name\" Kolin Kolistelut\" actually means\" Koli's rattling\", which may have had something to do with the decision that the conference was organized in the middle of a nature park, far away from urban civilization. More seriously, the goal was to establish a discussion forum where novel ideas of teaching computing could be exchanged and discussed in a setting where we retreat to an isolated place for a short time, and forget our everyday worries and tasks. Finns have had a tradition to go walking in a forest alone when they want to think seriously. Nature inspires us.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["924"]}

{"title": "PBL Cases and Their Role in Learning Programming\n", "abstract": " We describe and discuss our experiences on applying the seven steps method of problem-based learning in an introductory computer programming course. The emphasis is on the PBL cases used. We present a sample collection of cases and analyze them using a set of dimensions. The first three dimensions are the reality and open-endedness of the PBL case, and the specificity of the case description. The four additional dimensions are related to the activity that the students are expected to perform: acquiring factual knowledge, solving problems, designing a system, and diagnosing a system. We relate the cases to different aspects of programming skill and present student feedback on the cases.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["924"]}
