{"title": "Circuit recognition using netlist\n", "abstract": " The existing software for circuit design and simulation require the user to be skilled either with good programming ability or `pick and paste' model. To remove this barrier of programming knowledge, we propose a simulation model where a circuit drawn on a paper will be simulated. The circuit drawn on the paper will be fed to the computer using a scanner/camera. The image is de-noised and the nodes in the circuit are detected. All the characters, numbers and symbols alone are stored in a separate image which is used for optical character recognition. After node detection and character recognition, a netlist is compiled which is used for simulation. Applications of this simulation model include smart teaching systems, tablet app and with more research, a great deal of components including transistors and ICs can be simulated.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1496"]}
