{"title": "Scenario modelling with aspects\n", "abstract": " There has been significant recent interest, within the aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) community, in representing crosscutting concerns at various stages of the software lifecycle. However, most of these efforts have concentrated on the design and implementation phases. The focus of this paper is on representing aspects during requirements modelling. In particular, the issue of how to model aspects as part of scenario-based modelling is addressed. The use of scenarios is common in requirements development and analysis. The authors describe how to represent and compose aspects at the scenario level. Aspectual scenarios are modelled as interaction pattern specifications (IPSs) and are composed with nonaspectual scenarios using instantiation and special composition operators.

They can be used during software development, more specifically in the requirements elicitation activity, for identifying, complementing and validating the domain requirements. In this paper, we propose an approach that shows how social networks can be used as a source for capturing domain requirements. The aim is to perform the initial modeling of the system domain, providing a systematic methodology (process) for rapidly capturing relevant features that would not be straightforwardly elicited using traditional approaches. We apply this approach to the emergency systems domain (more specifically, floods in coastal areas), extracting information from the Twitter social network. The result is a domain model whose features can be reused in several applications of that domain. The application of the approach has been evaluated for its\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1472"]}
{"title": "Verifying BPMN understandability with novice business managers\n", "abstract": " Engineers 1, artists and craftsmen have long-established models to try out projects before running them. This makes the ideas and solutions proposed in the models clear enough to be perceived or understood. Similarly, the use of business process models can contribute to the specification of software requirements, facilitating the understanding and communication of the business from the point of view of software designers, as well as the managers. However, there is little research that examines whether BPMN business process models are more effective in their understanding than other representations, such as textual descriptions. This paper presents a research carried out with people from the management field, some who are familiar with and some who do not know BPMN, to verify if there are significant differences in terms of understanding the BPMN models in comparison to a textual representation.

{"title": "Guest Editors\u2019 Introduction: Early Aspects\u2014Analysis, Visualization, Conflicts and Composition\n", "abstract": " Early Aspects are aspects found in the early life cycle phases of software development, including requirements elicitation and analysis, domain analysis and architecture design activities. Aspects at these stages crosscut the modular units appropriate for their lifecycle activity; traditional requirements documentation, domain knowledge capture and architectural artifacts do not afford separate description of early aspects. As such, early aspects necessitate new modularizations to be effectively captured and maintained. Without new tools and techniques, early aspects remain tangled and scattered in lifecycle artifacts, and may lead to development, maintenance and evolution difficulties.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1472"]}
{"title": "Business processes fragments to promote information quality\n", "abstract": " PurposeThe primary concern of quality improvement in processes is not the input\u2013output conversion but the information that enables and controls process. This paper presents process fragments for dimensions of information quality (IQ).Design/methodology/approachResearch is based on the design science paradigm to create four fragments of reusable processes, that contemplate the following dimensions of IQ: accessibility, completeness, accuracy and consistency.FindingsThere is a theoretical discussion of the concept of IQ in process models, in which the fragments presented provide designers with a reduction in modeling time through reuse. Therefore, the designer has the flexibility to improve the IQ according to the context of each process.Practical implicationsThe discussion is relevant for both researchers and business designers because it shows that IQ is essential to guarantee the efficient execution of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1472"]}

The results were analyzed through logistic regression to understand the impact of the contextual factors on the intention to use C2G platforms and then those contextual factors were formalized as NFRs represented by a Softgoal Interdependence Graph.FindingsAmong the results, the most prominent factors were the influence of the \u201cusers perceived contribution\u201d and the \u201ccitizens concern about the city conditions\u201d.

{"title": "Towards a requirements language for modeling emotion in videogames.\n", "abstract": " The 1 videogame development process must focus on the user satisfaction. Failing to comply with this may jeopardize the success of the videogame, and even put at risk the owner company. Requirements Engineering is essential to elicit the needs and desires of the systems' stakeholders involved in the development, purchase and use of the videogames. The elicited requirements are the basis for the game specification document which is then the major driver for the construction of the videogame. The success of a game involves concerns, such as game strategy, plot and goal of the game, attractive interfaces, efficient algorithms, and, very important, the emotions that the game triggers on its players. This work focuses exactly on the requirements that specify the trigger for different types of emotions. Modeling such emotion requirements has not been much explored, maybe due to the high degree of subjectivity\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1472"]}
{"title": "Towards a domain specific modeling language for agent-based models in land use science\n", "abstract": " While Multi-Agent Systems are widely used in Land Use Science, it still remains challenging for scientists to specify their models in a manner that they can be understood and used by others. Domain users require a higher-level language to promote reuse, extension and replication of model based on agents. To overcome this issue, we propose the development of a domain specific modeling language (DSML) for agent-based models in Land Use Science. In this paper, we present the first step towards the development of the DSML, which consists of a domain analysis model for agent-based in Land Use Science.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1472"]}

{"title": "Integrating problem frames with aspects\n", "abstract": " Several requirements engineering approaches already provide means for the detection, specification and composition of crosscutting requirements during the preliminary stages of software development. Without the aspect-oriented techniques, the aspectual requirements would still be scattered by the various system components, impeding its implementation in a more modularized way, with a more understandable and easier to modify structure. However, not much has been done to integrate the concepts of aspects in Problem Frames (PF). This paper proposes an approach that integrates PF and aspect-oriented requirements. The result is the construction of more modularized PF models where expressive composition mechanisms are available. The approach was applied to a case study.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1472"]}
