{"title": "Automated reasoning for multi-step feature model configuration problems\n", "abstract": " The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of increasing software reusability. One software reuse approach is to develop a Software Product-line (SPL), which is a reconfigurable software architecture that can be reused across projects. Creating configurations of the SPL that meets arbitrary requirements is hard. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of the SPL in a single step. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these CSP configuration problem CSPs can be derived automatically with a constraint solver. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based technique can solve multi-step configuration problems involving hundreds of features in seconds.", "num_citations": "158\n", "authors": ["1505"]}
{"title": "Using Constraint Programming to Reason on Feature Models.\n", "abstract": " Feature models have been cited as one of the main contributions to model software product families. However, there is still a gap in product family engineering which is the automated reasoning on feature models. In this paper we describe how to reason on feature models using constraint programming. Although, there are a few attempts to reason on feature models there are two main drawbacks in these proposals: i) none of them associate parameters to features ii) none of them use constraint programming as the reasoning base. Using constraint programming endows our proposal with a more powerful reasoning capacity and greater expressiveness than others.", "num_citations": "122\n", "authors": ["1505"]}
