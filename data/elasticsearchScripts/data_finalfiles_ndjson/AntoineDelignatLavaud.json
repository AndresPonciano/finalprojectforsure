{"title": "Web PKI: Closing the Gap between Guidelines and Practices.\n", "abstract": " A string of recent attacks against the global public key infrastructure (PKI) has brought to light weaknesses in the certification authority (CA) system. In response, the CA/Browser Forum, a consortium of certification authorities and browser vendors, published in 2011 a set of requirements applicable to all certificates intended for use on the Web and issued after July 1st, 2012, following the successful adoption of the extended validation guidelines in 2007. We evaluate the actual level of adherence to the CA/Browser Forum guidelines over time, as well as the impact of each violation, by inspecting a large collection of certificates gathered from Web crawls. We further refine our analysis by automatically deriving profile templates that characterize the makeup of certificates per issuer. By integrating these templates with violation statistics, we are able to depict the practices of certification authorities worldwide, and thus to monitor the PKI and proactively detect major violations. Our method also provides new means of assessing the trustworthiness of SSL certificates used on the Web.", "num_citations": "45\n", "authors": ["686"]}

{"title": "On the security of authentication protocols on the web\n", "abstract": " Web services have become ubiquitous to manage virtually all the sensitive data (such as private communications, pictures and documents, financial and banking information, or health records) of individuals, corporations, and governments. The price to pay for making this data accessible in any way on the Web is the risk of unauthorized access and theft: altogether, the total attack surface for most websites that provide access to private data is tremendous, and the scalability in terms of users and data volume is mirrored in the scalability of attacks. In this thesis, we primarily focus on the authentication, authorization and access control aspects of information security, which leaves several important topics (such as operating system and network security of service providers, or human aspects of security such as credential protection and phishing) out of the scope of this work. In spite of this restricted emphasis, it turns out that the threat model involved in capturing even the most widespread and basic schemes used on the Web, such as the login systems used on a daily basis by over a billion users on Facebook or Google, is already extremely rich and challenging to evaluate formally. Yet, despite the tremendous practical significance of the security of these login systems, the frequency and diversity of successful attacks against them calls into question the current effectiveness of the security evaluation applied to these protocols. For instance, Facebook reports that it is able to detect over 600,000 daily login attempts that it considers to be malicious1. In all of these cases, the malicious party was able to wrongly obtain some form of credentials (either\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["686"]}
