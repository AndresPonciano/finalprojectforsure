{"title": "What are web services?\n", "abstract": " The second paper does a comparative study of the technologies necessary for Web Services implementation. It enumerates the standard and specifications areas for Web Services, and the challenges being faced in the technical implementation. It reviews the underlying technologies in each of the three sections in the Web Services stack\u2013interaction (between the service provider and the service requester), description of the service and the discovery agencies. Suggestions to make the future Web Services even better than their current implementation are include.The Web Services stack originates at the lower level of the protocol stack and builds up from TCP/IP (wire layer as the author calls it) to XML and SOAP (the Description layers). The description block describes servicespecific information such as the taxonomy of that particular Web Service, security requirements and cost and quality parameters. It contains the presentation layer that describes the user-interface for the given Web Service. The bottom-up ordering is-XML schema, interface description, implementation description and the policy and presentation layers. Next group in the description block consists of the orchestration, composition layers and the service and business level agreements.", "num_citations": "362\n", "authors": ["855"]}
{"title": "Definition languages for RESTful Web services: WADL vs. WSDL 2.0\n", "abstract": " There are two specifications for describing interfaces of HTTP based web applications, WADL and the WSDL 2.0 HTTP binding extension. These two languages are very similar, but there are some differences. This paper attempts to provide an unbiased, objective comparison of the two technologies, highlighting both the differences and similarities between WADL and the WSDL 2.0 HTTP binding.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["855"]}

{"title": "LossLess transformation of XBRL instance to XML data model instance\n", "abstract": " For each of a plurality of concepts indicated in an XBRL schema associated with an XBRL instance, concept relationship information is determined. The concept relationship information is determined from the XBRL schema, context information indicated in the XBRL instance, and at least one of a plurality of files that constitute a taxonomy set for the XBRL instance. Attribute information is determined for each concept based, at least in part, on the XBRL schema and at least one of the files that constitute the taxonomy set. An XML document is generated with XML elements structured in accordance with the concept relationship information. Each of the XML elements is populated with corresponding ones of XBRL facts to yield the structured XML data model instance.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["855"]}
{"title": "Filtering Policies to Enable Selection of Policy Subsets\n", "abstract": " A policy filter enables selection of a subset policy alternative that meets certain criteria from amongst a set of policy alternatives without having to specify the entire contents of the alternative to be selected. More specifically, the policy filter simplifies the process of selecting an appropriate alternative from amongst a set of available policy alternatives when the selection criteria comprises only a subset of the behaviors implied by an alternative by reducing the set of available alternatives to those that satisfy a certain criteria.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["855"]}
