Understanding such systems needs a high-level visual view of how the system operates as a whole to achieve some application related purpose. In this paper, we demonstrate how a visual high-level view called Use Case Maps (UCMs) may help in visualizing, understanding, and defining the behaviour of a Multi-agent medical diagnostic system.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["1261"]}
{"title": "An Approach to Improvement the Usability in Software Products\n", "abstract": " One of the significantaspects of software quality is usability. It is one of the characteristics that judge by the success or failure of software applications. The most important risk facing the software applications is usability which may lead to the existence of a gap between users and systems. This may lead to system failure because of Poor design. This is due to the design is not based on the desires and requirements of the customer. To overcome these problems, this paper proposed an approach to improve usability of software applications to meet the needs of the customer and interacts with the user easily with an efficient and effective manner. The proposed approach is based prototyping technique due to itssimplicity and it does not require additional costs to elicit precise and complete requirement and design.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["1261"]}
{"title": "A framework for the evaluation of agent-oriented methodologies\n", "abstract": " A number of methodologies are being suggested for multi-agent systems. Yet, their application is still very limited because they still lack several aspects for the development of agent systems and require improvement. In this context, a comparative framework for the evaluation of those methodologies is needed in order to show their advantages and disadvantages. This framework is an important factor for their improvement and development. This paper presents a framework for comparison and evaluation of agent methodologies. Several known methodologies are evaluated using this framework. The framework aims at recognizing the shortcomings of each of the methodologies and should help those pursuing development and improvement of agent oriented methodologies.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1261"]}

It improves software modularity by encapsulating crosscutting concerns into new units called aspects. Aspect Oriented Requirements Engineering (AORE) is an early stage of AOSD. It handles the identification and analysis of crosscutting concerns in requirements. The systematic activities of SoC are identification, separation, representation and composition of concerns. Numerous approaches have been proposed to support the identification and treatment of aspectual requirements. A large body of literature has been found dealing with crosscutting concerns in requirements phase. The aim of this paper is to review and investigate this literature.

{"title": "Applying the ISO standard in Assesing the Quality of Software Systems\n", "abstract": " Owing to the rapid developments in data and information systems, the software system quality is becoming an increasingly important issue. Ensuring quality in any product or service requires setting standards and ensuring that these are adhered to. In software development, using measurement and metrics ensures reliability and guarantees that the performance meets the requirements. Many software systems fail to achieve the goals they were designed for, as their weaknesses are not discovered in a timely manner. Moreover, their assessment is often not based on scientific methods. In order to mitigate this issue, in this research, the ISO standard (9126) is used to evaluate the quality of software. The findings reveal shortcomings in the construction, maintenance, evolution and reuse. A descriptive survey methodology is used, as this enables applying the standards when evaluating the quality of software systems\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1261"]}

The NL requirements are converted into a formal and controlled representation to increase the accuracy of the generated class diagram. A set of pre-defined rules has been developed to extract OO concepts such as classes, attributes, methods, and relationships to generate a UML class diagram from the given requirements specifications.

Database migration is concerned with the process of converting schema and data from a source RDB, as a one-time conversion, into a target XML database to be managed and handled in its new environment. The source schema is enriched semantically and translated into a target schema, and the data stored in the source database is converted into a target database based on the new schema. The semantic enrichment process is requisite to produce an enhanced metadata model from the source database and captures essential characteristics of target XML schema, and suitable for converting RDB data into an XML document. Algorithms are developed for producing the target database according to a set of migration rules to translate all constructs of an RDB into an XML Schema, based on which RDB data is\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1261"]}

However, the concept of reuse is not only related to implementation level, in fact, it can be included in the earlier stages of the software development life cycle such as design stage. Adopting reuse at this stage provides many benefits such as increasing productivity, saving time and reducing cost of software development.Accordingly, this paper presents the concept of reuse at design level in more details. As well as, it proposes an approach to improve the reusability of software design using the directed graph concept.
