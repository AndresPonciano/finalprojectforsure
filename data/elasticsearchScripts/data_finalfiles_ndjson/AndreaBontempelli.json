{"title": "Learning in the Wild with Incremental Skeptical Gaussian Processes\n", "abstract": " The ability to learn from human supervision is fundamental for personal assistants and other interactive applications of AI. Two central challenges for deploying interactive learners in the wild are the unreliable nature of the supervision and the varying complexity of the prediction task. We address a simple but representative setting, incremental classification in the wild, where the supervision is noisy and the number of classes grows over time. In order to tackle this task, we propose a redesign of skeptical learning centered around Gaussian Processes (GPs). Skeptical learning is a recent interactive strategy in which, if the machine is sufficiently confident that an example is mislabeled, it asks the annotator to reconsider her feedback. In many cases, this is often enough to obtain clean supervision. Our redesign, dubbed ISGP, leverages the uncertainty estimates supplied by GPs to better allocate labeling and contradiction queries, especially in the presence of noise. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that, as a result, while the original formulation of skeptical learning produces over-confident models that can fail completely in the wild, ISGP works well at varying levels of noise and as new classes are observed.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1113"]}
{"title": "Human-in-the-loop Handling of Knowledge Drift\n", "abstract": " We introduce and study knowledge drift (KD), a complex form of drift that occurs in hierarchical classification. Under KD the vocabulary of concepts, their individual distributions, and the is-a relations between them can all change over time. The main challenge is that, since the ground-truth concept hierarchy is unobserved, it is hard to tell apart different forms of KD. For instance, introducing a new is-a relation between two concepts might be confused with individual changes to those concepts, but it is far from equivalent. Failure to identify the right kind of KD compromises the concept hierarchy used by the classifier, leading to systematic prediction errors. Our key observation is that in many human-in-the-loop applications (like smart personal assistants) the user knows whether and what kind of drift occurred recently. Motivated by this, we introduce TRCKD, a novel approach that combines automated drift detection and adaptation with an interactive stage in which the user is asked to disambiguate between different kinds of KD. In addition, TRCKD implements a simple but effective knowledge-aware adaptation strategy. Our simulations show that often a handful of queries to the user are enough to substantially improve prediction performance on both synthetic and realistic data.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1113"]}
{"title": "Interactive Label Cleaning with Example-based Explanations\n", "abstract": " We tackle sequential learning under label noise in applications where a human supervisor can be queried to relabel suspicious examples. Existing approaches are flawed, in that they only relabel incoming examples that look ``suspicious'' to the model. As a consequence, those mislabeled examples that elude (or don't undergo) this cleaning step end up tainting the training data and the model with no further chance of being cleaned. We propose Cincer, a novel approach that cleans both new and past data by identifying pairs of mutually incompatible examples. Whenever it detects a suspicious example, Cincer identifies a counter-example in the training set that -- according to the model -- is maximally incompatible with the suspicious example, and asks the annotator to relabel either or both examples, resolving this possible inconsistency. The counter-examples are chosen to be maximally incompatible, so to serve as explanations of the model' suspicion, and highly influential, so to convey as much information as possible if relabeled. Cincer achieves this by leveraging an efficient and robust approximation of influence functions based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that clarifying the reasons behind the model's suspicions by cleaning the counter-examples helps acquiring substantially better data and models, especially when paired with our FIM approximation.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1113"]}
