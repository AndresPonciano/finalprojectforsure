For this reason, risk management is becoming more emphasized and systemized in Web projects so as to improve the quality of difficult decisions that normally encompass a higher level of risk exposures. Software architecture process is seen as iterative process and the amount of risk-related software architecture artifacts in each iteration of the process differ from that of other iterations. Each iteration of a process needs a unique decision-making process to accommodate certain risk factors. Since each iteration of Web project design has different types of risks in the decision-making process, a decision support system should be tailored to satisfy the specific needs of a particular iteration. In this way, various risks that arise through the life cycle of a project can be constantly checked and monitored. This research aims to support architectural design decision-making process through a risk identification architecture pattern model called RIAP. The model is anticipated to clarify high-level design process and to support active design decisions. Consequently, the software architecture becomes easier to communicate, maintain and evolve.

Many approaches and tools have been developed for handling modification requests, of which is the first step of the change management process. However, they lack of functionality to facilitate end users to specify their requests. This limitation causes problems not only to the end users, but to the maintainers as well, who need to understand the requests thoroughly before making any changes. We propose a user-centered technique to support the maintenance process by managing and tracking the modification requests effectively.

{"title": "Viewing Software Artifacts for Different Software Maintenance Categories Using Graph Representations\n", "abstract": " Information needed during an iterative process of a software maintenance process is much different from that of a software development process. Without up-dated documents, software maintainers need to gain information required to solve different maintenance categories through source codes hence consuming more time and effort. With the emergence of reverse engineering tools, the process of understanding source codes to solve maintenance tasks in different maintenance categories can be improved. Such tools employ diverse software visualisation methods that generate graph representations of parsed software artifacts. This paper discusses on how the graph representations provided by the proposed DocLike Modularised Graph (DMG) method employed in DocLike Viewer prototype tool can serve different levels of information needed by software maintainers in the case of corrective, adaptive and perfective maintenance category. It is observed that not only do software maintainers require diverse level of information; the necessity of the information is also not exactly of the same degree.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1019"]}
{"title": "A Document-Like Software Visualization Method for Effective Cognition of C-Based Software Systems\n", "abstract": " It is clear that maintenance is a crucial and very costly process in a software life cycle. Nowadays there are a lot of software systems particularly legacy systems that are always maintained from time to time as new requirements arise. One important source to understand a software system before it is being maintained is through the documentation, particularly system documentation. Unfortunately, not all software systems developed or maintained are accompanied with their reliable and updated documents. In this case, source codes will be the only reliable source for programmers. A number of studies have been carried out in order to assist cognition based on source codes. One way is through tool automation via reverse engineering technique in which source codes will be parsed and the information extracted will be visualized using certain visualization methods. Most software visualization methods use graph as the main element to represent extracted software artifacts. Nevertheless, current methods tend to produce more complicated graphs and do not grant an explicit, document-like re-documentation environment. Hence, this thesis proposes a document-like software visualization method called DocLike Modularized Graph (DMG). The method is realized in a prototype tool named DocLike Viewer that targets on C-based software systems. The main contribution of the DMG method is to provide an explicit structural re-document mechanism in the software visualization tool. Besides, the DMG method provides more level of information abstractions via less complex graph that include inter-module dependencies, inter-program dependencies\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1019"]}
{"title": "Generic Code Clone Detection Model for Java Applications\n", "abstract": " Code clone is a common term used for codes that are repeated multiple times in a program. There are Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4 code clones. Various code clone detection approaches and models have been used to detect a code clone. However, a major challenge faced in detecting code clone using these models is the lack of generality in detecting all clone types. To address this problem, Generic Code Clone Detection (GCCD) model that consists of five processes which are Preprocessing, Transformation, Parameterization, Categorization and Match Detection process is proposed. Initially, a pre-processing process produces source units through the application of five combinatorial rules. This is followed by the transformation process to produce transformed source units based on the letter to number substitution concept.

Practically, this method also provides an alternative means of reducing the educators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 workload effectively. By default, test data generation process plays an important role to perform a dynamic testing on students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 programs. Dynamic testing involves the execution of a program against different inputs or test data and the comparison of the results with the expected output, which must conform to the program specifications. In the software testing field, there have been diverse automated methods for test data generation. Unfortunately, APA rarely adopts these methods. Limited studies have attempted to integrate APA and test data generation to include more useful features and to provide a precise and thorough quality program testing. Thus, we propose a framework of test data generation known as FaSt-Gen covering both the functional and structural testing of a program for APA. Functional testing is a testing that relies on specified functional requirements and focuses the output generated in response to the selected test data and execution, Meanwhile, structural testing looks at the specific program logic to verify how it works.

{"title": "Enhancing Generic Pipeline Model for Code Clone Detection using Divide and Conquer Approach.\n", "abstract": " Code clone is known as identical copies of the same instances or fragments of source codes in software. Current code clone research focuses on the detection and analysis of code clones in order to help software developers identify code clones in source codes and reuse the source codes in order to decrease the maintenance cost. Many approaches such as textual based comparison approach, token based comparison and tree based comparison approach have been used to detect code clones. As software grows and becomes a legacy system, the complexity of these approaches in detecting code clones increases. Thus, this scenario makes it more difficult to detect code clones. Generic pipeline model is the most recent code clone detection that comprises five processes which are parsing process, pre-processing process, pooling process, comparing processes and filtering process to detect code clone. This research highlights the enhancement of the generic pipeline model using divide and conquer approach that involves concatenation process. The aim of this approach is to produce a better input for the generic pipeline model by processing smaller part of source code files before focusing on the large chunk of source codes in a single pipeline. We implement and apply the proposed approach with the support of a tool called Java Code Clone Detector (JCCD). The result obtained shows an improvement in the rate of code clone detection and overall runtime performance as compared to the existing generic pipeline model.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1019"]}

Some Web portals reveal the level of expertise of the members but the textual representation does not manage to highlight the different level of expertise among the community explicitly. Thus we have proposed KM-ClaVis approach that consists of a point-based semi automatic classification method to classify the users' expertise levels and the tree view method to visualize the classified expertise of a software engineering interest group (SEIG) e-community.
