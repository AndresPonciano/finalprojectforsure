A. fumigatus is able to produce dihydroxynaphthalene melanin, which is predominantly present in the conidia. Its biosynthesis is an important virulence determinant. Here, we show that A. fumigatus is able to produce an alternative melanin, i.e., pyomelanin, by a different pathway, starting from l-tyrosine. Proteome analysis indicated that the l-tyrosine degradation enzymes are synthesized when the fungus is grown with l-tyrosine in the medium. To investigate the pathway in detail, we deleted the genes encoding essential enzymes for pigment production, homogentisate dioxygenase (hmgA) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (hppD). Comparative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of synthetic pyomelanin and pigment extracted from A. fumigatus cultures confirmed the identity of the observed pigment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "209\n", "authors": ["858"]}

{"title": "A novel immune evasion strategy of Candida albicans: proteolytic cleavage of a salivary antimicrobial peptide\n", "abstract": " Oropharyngeal candidiasis is an opportunistic infection considered to be a harbinger of AIDS. The etiologic agent Candida albicans is a fungal species commonly colonizing human mucosal surfaces. However, under conditions of immune dysfunction, colonizing C. albicans can become an opportunistic pathogen causing superficial or even life-threatening infections. The reasons behind this transition, however, are not clear. In the oral cavity, salivary antimicrobial peptides are considered to be an important part of the host innate defense system in the prevention of microbial colonization. Histatin-5 specifically has exhibited potent activity against C. albicans. Our previous studies have shown histatin-5 levels to be significantly reduced in the saliva of HIV+ individuals, indicating an important role for histatin-5 in keeping C. albicans in its commensal stage. The versatility in the pathogenic potential of C. albicans is the result of its ability to adapt through the regulation of virulence determinants, most notably of which are proteolytic enzymes (Saps), involved in tissue degradation. In this study, we show that C. albicans cells efficiently and rapidly degrade histatin-5, resulting in loss of its anti-candidal potency. In addition, we demonstrate that this cellular activity is due to proteolysis by a member of the secreted aspartic proteases (Sap) family involved in C. albicans pathogenesis. Specifically, the proteolysis was attributed to Sap9, in turn identifying histatin-5 as the first host-specific substrate for that isoenzyme. These findings demonstrate for the first time the ability of a specific C. albicans enzyme to degrade and deactivate a host antimicrobial peptide\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "152\n", "authors": ["858"]}

Among cultivated plants, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important grain legume. Yet, our understanding of the origins and concurrent shaping of the genome of this crop plant is limited. We sequenced the genomes of 29 accessions representing 12 Phaseolus species. Single nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenomic analyses, using both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, allowed us to detect a speciation event, a finding further supported by metabolite profiling. In addition, we identified ~1200 protein coding genes (PCGs) and ~100 long non-coding RNAs with domestication-associated haplotypes. Finally, we describe asymmetric introgression events occurring among common bean subpopulations in Mesoamerica and across hemispheres. We uncover an unpredicted speciation event in the tropical Andes that gave rise to a sibling species, formerly considered the \u201cwild ancestor\u201d of P. vulgaris, which diverged before the split of the Mesoamerican and Andean P. vulgaris gene pools. Further, we identify haplotypes strongly associated with genes underlying the emergence of domestication traits.

The nuclear genome of land plants encodes two tpi genes, one gene product is located in the cytoplasm and the other is imported into the chloroplast. Herein we report the crystal structures of the TPIs from the vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana (AtTPIs) and address their enzymatic modulation by redox agents. Cytoplasmic TPI (cTPI) and chloroplast TPI (pdTPI) share more than 60% amino acid identity and assemble as (\u03b2-\u03b1)8 dimers with high structural homology. cTPI and pdTPI harbor two and one accessible thiol groups per monomer respectively. cTPI and pdTPI present a cysteine at an equivalent structural position (C13 and C15 respectively) and cTPI also contains a specific solvent accessible cysteine at residue 218 (cTPI-C218). Site directed mutagenesis of residues pdTPI-C15, cTPI-C13 and cTPI-C218 to serine substantially decreases enzymatic activity, indicating that the structural integrity of these cysteines is necessary for catalysis. AtTPIs exhibit differential responses to oxidative agents, cTPI is susceptible to oxidative agents such as diamide and H2O2, whereas pdTPI is resistant to inhibition. Incubation of AtTPIs with the sulfhydryl conjugating reagents methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMTS) and glutathione inhibits enzymatic activity. However, the concentration necessary to inhibit pdTPI is at least two orders of magnitude higher than the concentration needed to inhibit cTPI.

Bean improvement efforts have been focused on classical breeding techniques because bean is recalcitrant to both somatic embryogenesis and in vitro regeneration. This study was undertaken to better understand the process of somatic embryogenesis in the common bean. We focused on the mechanisms by which somatic embryogenesis in plants is regulated and the interaction of these mechanisms with plant hormones. Specifically, we examined the role of the gene PvTRX1h, an ortholog of a major known histone lysine methyltransferase in plants, in somatic embryo generation. Given the problems with regeneration and transformation, we chose to develop and use regeneration-competent callus that could be successively transformed. Embryogenic calli of common bean were generated and transformed with the PvTRX1hRiA construction to down-regulate, by RNA interference, expression of the PvTRX1h gene. Plant hormone content was measured by mass spectrometry and gene expression was assessed by q-PCR. Detailed histological analysis was performed on selected transgenic embryogenic calli. It was determined that down-regulation of PvTRX1h gene was accompanied by altered concentrations of plant hormones in the calli. PvTRX1h regulated the expression of genes involved in auxin biosynthesis and embryogenic calli in which PvTRX1h was down-regulated were capable of differentiation into somatic embryos.

The measured nicotine concentrations in different experiments were comparable to literature data obtained with conventional methods. The observed compounds suggest the rupture of trichomes, and cell damage was observed on the spots exposed to LTP. However, the lesions only affected a negligible proportion of the leaf surface area and no systemic reaction was noted. Thus, our study provides the proof-of-concept for measuring the biosynthetic activity of plant surfaces in vivo.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["858"]}
{"title": "Improved Representation of Biological Information by Using Correlation as Distance Function for Heatmap Cluster Analysis\n", "abstract": " Heatmap cluster figures are often used to represent data sets in the\u00a0omic sciences. The default option of the frequently used R heatmap function is to cluster data according to Euclidean distance, which groups data mainly to their numerical value and not to its relative behaviour. The disadvantage of using the default clustering\u00a0dendrograms of R is demonstrated. Instead, a script is provided that uses correlation as distance function, which better reveals biologically meaningful information. This optimized script was used to detect heterotic groups in Vitamaize hybrids (purple maize with high nutraceutical value). A field trial with different genetic combinations was performed through an agricultural phenomics approach (holistic evaluation of the phenotype). The grain yield data and other phenotypic variables were represented through heatmap figures. In the data set of Mexican tropical maize germplasm, at least three heterotic groups were detected, in contrast to only two heterotic groups reported earlier in temperate yellow maize from USA and Europe. This optimized script for heatmap correlation bicluster can also be used to better represent metabolomic fingerprints and transcriptomic data sets.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["858"]}
{"title": "Identification of B6T173 (ZmPrx35) as the prevailing peroxidase in highly insect-resistant maize (Zea mays, p84C3) kernels by activity-directed purification\n", "abstract": " Plant peroxidases (PODs) are involved in diverse physiological processes, including defence against pathogens and insects. Contrary to their biological importance, only very few plant peroxidases have been proven on protein level, because their low abundance makes them difficult to detect in standard proteomics work-flows. A statistically significant positive correlation between peroxidase activity and post-harvest insect resistance has been found for maize (Zea mays, p84C3) kernels. In combining activity-directed protein purification, genomic and proteomic tools we found that protein B6T173 (ZmPrx35) is responsible for the majority of the peroxidase activity of the kernel. We successfully produced recombinant ZmPrx35 protein in Escherichia coli and demonstrate both, in vitro activity and the presence of a haem (heme) cofactor of the enzyme. Our findings support the screening for insect resistant maize variants and the construction of genetically optimised maize plants.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["858"]}

{"title": "Accelerated identification of proteins by mass spectrometry by employing covalent pre-gel staining with Uniblue A\n", "abstract": " Background The identification of proteins by mass spectrometry is a standard method in biopharmaceutical quality control and biochemical research. Prior to identification by mass spectrometry, proteins are usually pre-separated by electrophoresis. However, current protein staining and de-staining protocols are tedious and time consuming, and therefore prolong the sample preparation time for mass spectrometry.   Methodology and Principal Findings We developed a 1-minute covalent pre-gel staining protocol for proteins, which does not require de-staining before the mass spectrometry analysis. We investigated the electrophoretic properties of derivatized proteins and peptides and studied their behavior in mass spectrometry. Further, we elucidated the preferred reaction of proteins with Uniblue A and demonstrate the integration of the peptide derivatization into typical informatics tools.   Conclusions and Significance The Uniblue A staining method drastically speeds up the sample preparation for the mass spectrometry based identification of proteins. The application of this chemo-proteomic strategy will be advantageous for routine quality control of proteins and for time-critical tasks in protein analysis.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["858"]}

These alkaloids are the starting material in the production of different pharmaceuticals. The commercial demand for tropane alkaloids is covered by extracting them from cultivated plants. Datura stramonium is cultivated under greenhouse conditions as a source of tropane alkaloids. Here we investigate the effect of different levels of water availability in the soil on the production of tropane alkaloids by D. stramonium. Methods: We tested four irrigation levels on the accumulation of tropane alkaloids. We analyzed the profile of tropane alkaloids using an untargeted liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method. Results: Using a combination of informatics and manual interpretation of mass spectra, we generated several structure hypotheses for signals in D. stramonium extracts that we assign as putative tropane alkaloids. Quantitation of mass spectrometry signals for our structure hypotheses across different anatomical organs allowed us to identify patterns of tropane alkaloids associated with different levels of irrigation. Furthermore, we identified anatomic partitioning of tropane alkaloid isomers with pharmaceutical applications. Conclusions: Our results show that soil water availability is an effective method for maximizing the production of specific tropane alkaloids for industrial applications.

{"title": "Popper and the Omics\n", "abstract": " Omics techniques produce information, but not necessarily scientific knowledge. Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, and other-omics generate unprecedented amounts of experimental data about cells or tissues under certain conditions. However, from an epistemological point of view, merely fitting data into a model to explain observations is not sufficient; science should strive to describe simple and logical theoretical systems that are testable and that enable predictions (Popper, 1959). This paper tries to alleviate this dilemma by suggesting data mining strategies to support the conversion of Omics data into resilient models.Inductive science, which draws conclusions from empirical observations, is descriptive, and multiple models can explain the same set of data. The prediction of future events from past observations might be plausible and could appear to be in agreement with our experiences, but the derivation of natural laws or theories cannot be justified by fitting observations into a model.

This work explores the effect of a master regulator of plant development, BOLITA (BOL), in plant metabolism, with a special focus on specialized metabolism. For this, we used an Arabidopsis thaliana line in which the transcription factor activity can be induced. Fingerprinting metabolomic analyses of whole plantlets were performed at different times after induction. After 96 h, all induced replicas clustered as a single group, in contrast with all controls which did not cluster. Metabolomic analyses of shoot and root tissues enabled the putative identification of differentially accumulated metabolites in each tissue. Finally, the analysis of global gene expression in induced vs. non-induced root samples, together with enrichment analyses, allowed the identification of enriched metabolic pathways among the differentially expressed genes and accumulated metabolites after the induction.

Although this and other studies have suggested the important positive role played by JA in the regulation of AMF root colonization in tomato plants, it is currently unclear how different host plant genetic backgrounds affect gene expression and secondary metabolites variation during JA-dependent mycorrhization. In this study, wild type and spr2 mutant tomato plants having \u201clow\u201d,\u201cmedium\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d mycorrhizal colonization with Rhizophagus irregularis, were analyzed independently using transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomic approaches.

Only a few wound responsive genes, including JA signaling and biosynthesis genes, such as Prosystemin and JAZ2 were found to influence AMF colonization. Conversely, a systemic and JA-dependent induction/repression of genes different from those altered in roots was detected in leaves of mycorrhizal plants.

It is a component of numerous proteins and participates in cell redox reactions; iron deficiency results in a reduction in nutritional quality and crop yields. Volatiles from the rhizobacterium Arthrobacter agilis UMCV2 induce iron acquisition mechanisms in plants. However, it is not known whether microbial volatiles modulate other metabolic plant stress responses to reduce the negative effect of iron deficiency. Mass spectrometry has great potential to analyze metabolite alterations in plants exposed to biotic and abiotic factors. Direct liquid introduction-electrospray-mass spectrometry was used to study the metabolite profile in Medicago truncatula due to iron deficiency, and in response to microbial volatiles. The putatively identified compounds belonged to different classes, including pigments, terpenes, flavonoids, and brassinosteroids, which have been associated with defense responses against abiotic stress. Notably, the levels of these compounds increased in the presence of the rhizobacterium. In particular, the analysis of brassinolide by gas chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry showed that the phytohormone increased ten times in plants grown under iron-deficient growth conditions and exposed to microbial volatiles. In this mass spectrometry-based study, we provide new evidence on the role of A. agilis UMCV2 in the modulation of certain compounds involved in stress tolerance in M. truncatula.

It remains unclear, however, if CHD1 has a similar role in normal diploid cells. Using a specifically tailored quantitative mass spectrometry approach, we show that Chd1 disruption results in reduced H3.3 levels in heads of Chd1 mutant flies. Chd1 deletion perturbs brain chromatin structure in a similar way as H3.3 deletion and leads to global de-repression of transcription. The physiological consequences are reduced food intake, metabolic alterations, and shortened lifespan. Notably, brain-specific CHD1 expression rescues these phenotypes. We further demonstrate a strong genetic interaction between Chd1 and H3.3 chaperone Hira. Thus, our findings establish CHD1 as a factor required for the assembly of H3.3-containing\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["858"]}

Besides carbohydrates and amino acids, maize contains micronutrients such as vitamins and phytochemicals with health-promoting effects. In a current maize breeding program, the phytochemical profiles of 35 maize hybrids grown in three significant agroecologies of Mexico - highlands, subtropics and tropics - were evaluated. For the different locations, phytochemical traits, which are relevant for nutraceutical effects, and the antioxidative capacity, were determined. Statistical analyses indicate the importance of the pedigree/agroecology on the phytochemical profiles. Mass fingerprinting in combination with the Random Forest Tree algorithm allowed the building of models that predicted the antioxidative capacity of the maize hybrids. The methods are, therefore, suitable for the efficient selection of maize hybrids with\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["858"]}
{"title": "Modulation of aleurone peroxidases in kernels of insect-resistant maize (Zea mays L.; Pob84-C3R) after mechanical and insect damage\n", "abstract": " Peroxidases (PODs) have many biological functions during the plant life cycle. In maize kernels, endosperm PODs have been identified as biochemical contributors to resistance against Sitophilus zeamais, but their identities have not been determined. In this study, we identified these PODs and determined whether their contributions are basal or inducible. Semi-purification and LC-MS/MS analyses showed that the protein ZmPrx35 is the predominant soluble endosperm POD from Pob84-C3R maize. Subsequent time-course analyses after mechanical damage showed that POD activity is regulated in a fluctuating kinetics pattern and that zmprx35 mRNA expression levels reflected this pattern. After 48 h of infestation with S. zeamais or Prostephanus truncatus, soluble endosperm POD activities were 1.38- or 0.85-fold, respectively. Under the same conditions, zmprx35 expression was induced 1.61-fold (S. zeamais infestation) and 1.17-fold (P. truncatus infestation). These findings suggest that ZmPrx35 may contribute to the protective responses of aleurone cells against wounding and pest attacks, which could be enhanced/repressed by insect factors. Our data also provide evidence that the mechanisms of resistance towards the insect pests S. zeamais and P. truncatus are independent.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["858"]}

Contrary to wild-type (WT) plants, JA levels in root and leaves of spr2 mutants remained unchanged in response to AMF colonization, further supporting its regulatory role in the AM symbiosis. Decreased AMF colonization in spr2 plants was also linked to alterations associated with a disrupted FAD7 function, such as enhanced salicylic acid (SA) levels and SA-related defense gene expression and a reduction in fatty acid content in both mycorrhizal spr2 roots and leaves. Transcriptomic data revealed that lower mycorrhizal colonization efficiency in spr2 mutants coincided with the modified expression of key genes controlling gibberellin and ethylene signaling, brassinosteroid, ethylene, apocarotenoid and phenylpropanoid synthesis, and the wound response. Targeted metabolomic analysis, performed at 45 dpi, revealed augmented contents of L-threonic acid and DL-malic acid in colonized spr2 roots which suggested unfavorable conditions for AMF colonization. Additionally, time- and genotype-dependent changes in root steroid glycoalkaloid levels, including tomatine, suggested that these metabolites might positively regulate the AM symbiosis in tomato. Untargeted metabolomic analysis demonstrated that the tomato root metabolomes were distinctly affected by genotype\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["858"]}

{"title": "Formatting Open Science: agile creation of multiple document types by writing academic manuscripts in pandoc markdown\n", "abstract": " The timely publication of scientific results is essential for dynamic advances in science. The ubiquitous availability of computers which are connected to a global network made the rapid and low-cost distribution of information through electronic channels possible. New concepts, such as Open Access publishing and preprint servers are currently changing the traditional print media business towards a community-driven peer production. However, the cost of scientific literature generation, which is either charged to readers, authors or sponsors, is still high. The main active participants in the authoring and evaluation of scientific manuscripts are volunteers, and the cost for online publishing infrastructure is close to negligible. A major time and cost factor though is the formatting of manuscripts in the production stage. In this article we demonstrate the feasibility to write scientific manuscripts in plain markdown (MD) text files, which can be easily converted into common publication formats, such as PDF, HTML or EPUB, using pandoc. The simple syntax of markdown assures the long-term readability of raw files and the development of software and workflows. We show the implementation of typical elements of scientific manuscripts--formulas, tables, code blocks and citations--and present tools for editing, collaborative writing and version control. We give an example on how to prepare a manuscript with distinct output formats, a DOCX file for submission to a journal and a LATEX/PDF version for deposition as a PeerJ preprint.

In this context, it is increasingly important to understand the biochemical responses of cells to environmental cues at the whole system level, an aim that is being brought closer by advances in high throughput, cost-efficient plant metabolomics. To support molecular breeding activities, we have assessed the economic, technical and statistical feasibility of using direct mass spectrometry methods to evaluate the physiological state of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown under different stress conditions.Plants react to external signals by changes of their gene expression, changes in proteomic profiles and adjustments of metabolic fluxes and steady state levels. The metabolic ability of sessile plants to adapt to a dynamic environment is crucial for their survival. The drastic climatic change caused by human activities is creating ever more extreme agro-ecosystems: in vulnerable subtropical countries such as Mexico, the productivity of food crops such as maize (Zea mays L.) is threatened by rising temperatures, lixiviation, lack of water and extended drought periods. Smallscale farmers, in particular, are projected to experience significant losses, since they can neither afford fertilizers nor irrigation systems. 1 For the successful breeding of stress tolerant maize varieties it will become more important not only to consider the genomic sequence of an organism, but also its actual ability to respond adequately and rapidly to hostile conditions. 2, 3 For the discovery of molecules which might\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["858"]}
