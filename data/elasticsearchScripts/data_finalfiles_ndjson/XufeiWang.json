{"title": "Soundspaces: Audio-visual navigation in 3d environments\n", "abstract": " Moving around in the world is naturally a multisensory experience, but today\u2019s embodied agents are deaf\u2014restricted to solely their visual perception of the environment. We introduce audio-visual navigation for complex, acoustically and visually realistic 3D environments. By both seeing and hearing, the agent must learn to navigate to a sounding object. We propose a multi-modal deep reinforcement learning approach to train navigation policies end-to-end from a stream of egocentric audio-visual observations, allowing the agent to (1) discover elements of the geometry of the physical space indicated by the reverberating audio and (2) detect and follow sound-emitting targets. We further introduce SoundSpaces: a first-of-its-kind dataset of audio renderings based on geometrical acoustic simulations for two sets of publicly available 3D environments (Matterport3D and Replica), and we instrument Habitat to support\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "62\n", "authors": ["1185"]}
{"title": "MOSNet: Deep learning based objective assessment for voice conversion\n", "abstract": " Existing objective evaluation metrics for voice conversion (VC) are not always correlated with human perception. Therefore, training VC models with such criteria may not effectively improve naturalness and similarity of converted speech. In this paper, we propose deep learning-based assessment models to predict human ratings of converted speech. We adopt the convolutional and recurrent neural network models to build a mean opinion score (MOS) predictor, termed as MOSNet. The proposed models are tested on large-scale listening test results of the Voice Conversion Challenge (VCC) 2018. Experimental results show that the predicted scores of the proposed MOSNet are highly correlated with human MOS ratings at the system level while being fairly correlated with human MOS ratings at the utterance level. Meanwhile, we have modified MOSNet to predict the similarity scores, and the preliminary results show that the predicted scores are also fairly correlated with human ratings. These results confirm that the proposed models could be used as a computational evaluator to measure the MOS of VC systems to reduce the need for expensive human rating.", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["1185"]}
{"title": "Speaker anonymization using x-vector and neural waveform models\n", "abstract": " The social media revolution has produced a plethora of web services to which users can easily upload and share multimedia documents. Despite the popularity and convenience of such services, the sharing of such inherently personal data, including speech data, raises obvious security and privacy concerns. In particular, a user's speech data may be acquired and used with speech synthesis systems to produce high-quality speech utterances which reflect the same user's speaker identity. These utterances may then be used to attack speaker verification systems. One solution to mitigate these concerns involves the concealing of speaker identities before the sharing of speech data. For this purpose, we present a new approach to speaker anonymization. The idea is to extract linguistic and speaker identity features from an utterance and then to use these with neural acoustic and waveform models to synthesize anonymized speech. The original speaker identity, in the form of timbre, is suppressed and replaced with that of an anonymous pseudo identity. The approach exploits state-of-the-art x-vector speaker representations. These are used to derive anonymized pseudo speaker identities through the combination of multiple, random speaker x-vectors. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective in concealing speaker identities. It increases the equal error rate of a speaker verification system while maintaining high quality, anonymized speech.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["1185"]}
{"title": "Fine-tune bert for docred with two-step process\n", "abstract": " Modelling relations between multiple entities has attracted increasing attention recently, and a new dataset called DocRED has been collected in order to accelerate the research on the document-level relation extraction. Current baselines for this task uses BiLSTM to encode the whole document and are trained from scratch. We argue that such simple baselines are not strong enough to model to complex interaction between entities. In this paper, we further apply a pre-trained language model (BERT) to provide a stronger baseline for this task. We also find that solving this task in phases can further improve the performance. The first step is to predict whether or not two entities have a relation, the second step is to predict the specific relation.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["1185"]}
{"title": "Circuit-integratable high-frequency micro supercapacitors with filter/oscillator demonstrations\n", "abstract": " Micro supercapacitor (MSC) featured by high capacitance density, has great potential for replacing bulky electrolytic capacitors in circuits to make electronics of miniaturization, yet suffers from sharp capacitance drop under alternating current. Here, we report a circuit-integratable high-frequency MSC with hybrid architecture electrode, in which 2D pseudocapacitive MXene served as the active material provides large capacitance and multi-walled carbon nanotube applied as interlayer support offers fast ion transport paths. Such design brings the device an excellent frequency response and a capacitance density much higher than commercial tantalum capacitors at 120\u202fHz. A novel transfer-free filtration technology greatly eliminates the equivalent series resistance and the consequent thermal loss, and makes the MSC a more circuit-integratable planar geometry.

This conclusion is complimented with the results from electrophoresis experiments and by solution chemistry analysis. The PbOH+ and Pb(OH)2 (aq) species which are believed to be responsible for silica activation were found to precipitate at the silica surface. These island-like precipitate structures were clearly observed using AFM and SEM imaging. With amyl xanthate addition, lead amyl xanthate was formed as revealed by FTIR. Contact angle measurements further confirmed the nature of lead activation in silica flotation with amyl xanthate collector.", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["1185"]}
{"title": "Preparation of PVDF membranes via the low-temperature TIPS method with diluent mixtures: The role of coagulation conditions and cooling rate\n", "abstract": " To obtain a high-performance polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, low-temperature thermally induced phase separation (LT-TIPS) was employed to prepare microporous flat PVDF membranes and hollow-fiber membranes using diluent mixtures of triethylphosphate and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate. The membrane morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results show that thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) played a more important role than nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) in determining the cross-sectional morphology of the membranes, and the surface structure was mainly affected by NIPS in a low-temperature (0\u00a0\u00b0C) coagulation bath. By increasing the temperature of the coagulation bath, different structures of membranes, such as spherulites and cellular and sponge structures, were observed.

{"title": "Highly sensitive compact refractive index sensor based on phase-shifted sidewall Bragg gratings in slot waveguide\n", "abstract": " The geometrical and physical parameters of phase-shifted sidewall Bragg gratings in a silicon slot waveguide are optimized to possess performance characteristics desirable for integrated optical sensors. By tailoring the spectral response of such phase-shifted sidewall gratings, highly sensitive compact refractive index sensors detecting the resonance wavelength shift or the variation of light intensity are designed with the transfer matrix method. Both refractive index sensors have a minimum detection limit on the order of 10^\u22126, and a linear response and a compact structure dimension as small as 11.7\u00a0\u03bcm, offering the capabilities for sensor array and lab-on-a-chip integration. The resonance-shift sensor has a much wider detection range of 1.32 refractive index units than the intensity-measurement sensor.

{"title": "Evaluating the softness of animal fibers\n", "abstract": " Softness is an important property of textile fibers, and animal fibers in particular. At present, there is no reliable method for objectively evaluating fiber softness. This paper examines a simple technique of such evaluations by pulling a bundle of parallel fibers through a series of pins. Softer fibers with lower bending rigidities and smoother surfaces should have lower pulling forces. Alpaca and wool fibers are used in this study to validate this technique, and the results suggest that pulling force measurements can reflect differences in fiber softness.", "num_citations": "41\n", "authors": ["1185"]}

The limitations of conventional anchors for FRP tendons/cables were first analyzed. A new type of conical anchor with novel continuous-fiber-reinforced load transfer component (LTC) was proposed to overcome shortcomings of conventional anchors. The four key factors affecting anchor efficiency including modulus variation, conical degree, anchor length and the thickness of LTC were analyzed respectively. The results show that the proposed anchor not only owns an essential advantage in bonding by integrating LTC and FRP cable but also realizes the variable modulus of LTC by changing the winding angle of fiber roving.
