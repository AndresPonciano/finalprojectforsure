{"title": "Framework for feature selection in health assessment systems\n", "abstract": " Anomaly detection in health assessment systems has gained much attention in the recent past. Various feature selection techniques have been proposed for successful anomaly detection. However, these methods do not cater for the need to select features in health assessment systems. Most of the present techniques are data dependent and do not offer an option for incorporating domain information. This paper proposes a novel domain knowledge-driven feature selection framework named domain-driven selective wrapping (DSW) that can help in the selection of a correlated feature subset. The proposed framework uses an expert\u2019s domain knowledge for the selection of subsets. The framework uses a custom-designed logic-driven anomaly detection block (LDAB) as a wrapper. The experiment results show that the proposed framework is able to select feature subsets more efficiently than traditional\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1093"]}
{"title": "ZigBee wireless networking technology and application based on LM3S9B96+ CC2520\n", "abstract": " ZigBee is a new wireless sensor network technology based on IEEE 802.15. 4. It has short range, low power, low cost and low data rate. Network nodes are the physical carriers of the wireless sensor networks. How to realize the intelligent access of network nodes becomes the key issue. In this paper, intelligent wireless communication nodes are realized based on LM3S9B96+ CC2520 platform. ZigBee wireless networking and data communication technology are analyzied. Finally, the intelligent parking guidance system is realized based on the platform.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1093"]}
