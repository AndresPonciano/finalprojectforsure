{"title": "Innovation management-strategies, implementation, and profits\n", "abstract": " Second, for many firms, competitive advantage is gained and maintained through innovation. It is also lost when firms do not innovate and their competitors do. As such, I have drawn on the literature in strategy, especially the product-market position and resource-based views of the firm. I have emphasized the link between new ideas and continued profits. The focus is on a firm that wants to profit from an innovation. Third, innovation is not limited to high technology. Surely Glaxo\u2019s blockbuster ulcer drug, Zantac, was an innovation. But so was Federal Express\u2019s offering of overnight package delivery. Innovations do not have to be breakthroughs either. Fourth, innovation usually means change, both in the organizational and the economic sense, and therefore any models that seek to understand the phenomenon are necessarily multidisciplinary.

Under such circumstances a firm may choose to crowdsource problem solving rather than solve the problem internally or contract it to a designated supplier. These circumstances depend on the characteristics of the problem, the knowledge required for the solution, the crowd, and the solutions to be evaluated.", "num_citations": "1380\n", "authors": ["2075"]}

{"title": "A critical assessment of business model research\n", "abstract": " Ever since the Internet boom of the mid-1990s, firms have been experimenting with new ways of doing business and achieving their goals, which has led to a branching of the scholarly literature on business models. Three interpretations of the meaning and function of \u201cbusiness models\u201d have emerged from the management literature: (1) business models as attributes of real firms, (2) business models as cognitive/linguistic schemas, and (3) business models as formal conceptual representations of how a business functions. Relatedly, a provocative debate about the relationship between business models and strategy has fascinated many scholars. We offer a critical review of this now vast business model literature with the goal of organizing the literature and achieving greater understanding of the larger picture in this increasingly important research area.

The paper is the result of a collaborative process among several OI scholars \u2013 having a common basis in the recurrent Professional Development Workshop on \u2018Researching Open Innovation\u2019 at the Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management. In this paper, we present opportunities for future research on OI, organised at different levels of analysis. We discuss some of the contingencies at these different levels, and argue that future research needs to study OI \u2013 originally an organisational-level phenomenon \u2013 across multiple levels of analysis. While our integrative framework allows comparing, contrasting and integrating various perspectives at different levels of analysis, further theorising will be needed to advance OI research.

{"title": "Dynamic boundaries of the firm: are firms better off being vertically integrated in the face of a technological change?\n", "abstract": " Building on transaction cost economics and the knowledge-based theory of the firm, I argue that, following a technological change that is competence-destroying to firms and their suppliers, firms that are integrated vertically into the new technology will perform better than those that are not. At the same time, firms that had been vertically integrated into the old technology will perform worse than those that had not been. This argument suggests that the efficient boundaries of a firm are dynamic.

This paper presents a model for mapping firm capabilities into customer value and competitive advantage in different markets. With empirical evidence from cholesterol drugs, I illustrate how the model can be used to estimate customer value and competitive advantage from technological capabilities.

{"title": "The hypercube of innovation\n", "abstract": " Innovation has frequently been categorized as either radical, incremental, architectural, modular or niche, based on the effects which it has on the competence, other products, and investment decisions of the innovating entity. Often, however, an innovation which is, say, architectural at the innovator/ manufacturer level, may turn out to be radical to customers, incremental to suppliers of components and equipment, and something else to suppliers of critical complementary innovations. These various faces of one innovation at different stages of the innovation value-added chain are what we call the hypercube of innovation. For many high-technology products, a technology strategy that neglects these various faces of an innovation and dwells only on the effects of the innovation at the innovator/manufacturer level can have disastrous effects.

I argue that the effect of the emergence and diffusion of the internet on a firm's boundaries is a function of the firm's determinants of costs, moderated by the information dependence and tacitness of the firm's value-adding activities and the organizational technology that underpins the firm's primary activities. Contrary to previous research, the models suggest that the emergence and diffusion of the internet should also expand some firm boundaries.", "num_citations": "311\n", "authors": ["2075"]}

The role of structure and conduct\n", "abstract": " Rooted in neoclassical economics, network effects research has revolved around size, arguing that the more users a network has, the more valuable that network will be to each user. I argue that a network's structure (feasibility of transactions, centrality of members, structural holes, network ties, the number of roles each member plays) and its conduct (opportunistic behavior, reputation signaling, perceptions of trust) also have significant impacts on a network's value to users and to network providers. Network research that neglects structure and conduct and focuses only on size can lead to wrong strategies or a misleading research agenda.

As technology evolves, so do industry characteristics, products and critical success factors. Firms without the right capabilities are forced to quit the scene. Thus an industry's structure, attractiveness and the kinds of capabilities that it needs to succeed may vary over time, suggesting different strategies for each phase.", "num_citations": "250\n", "authors": ["2075"]}

Bloodgood argues that because of the nature of crowdsourcing, value capture should have played a larger role in our theorizing than it did. While interesting and important, we consider this line of thinking slightly tangential to our original intent. Since our motivation for writing the article is relevant to our response, we start with that motivation. We then address the premise that value capture is the most important factor in theorizing about crowdsourcing. Finally, we address the principal comments about whether our model adequately accounts for the value capture \u201cdisadvantages\u201d of crowdsourcing.", "num_citations": "105\n", "authors": ["2075"]}
{"title": "A model of the Internet as creative destroyer\n", "abstract": " The extent to which a technological change is a creative destroyer is of interest to entrepreneurs who can exploit the opportunity and to incumbents who must defend their existing competitive advantages from the change. In the face of a technological change, an important question is: To what extent is it a creative destroyer? In this paper, we offer a model for exploring the depth and breadth of creative destruction from the Internet and the implications for wealth creation and competitive advantage. We apply the model to three groups of industries, each of which rests on one of Thompson's three categories of organizational technologies: long-linked; mediating; and intensive. The application suggests that incumbents in all industries should experience some erosion of competitive advantage. Industries with predominantly mediating technologies should experience creative destruction. Those with intensive technologies\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "88\n", "authors": ["2075"]}
