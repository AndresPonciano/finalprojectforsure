{"title": "Cohort-based Federated Learning Services for Industrial Collaboration on the Edge\n", "abstract": " Machine Learning (ML) is increasingly applied in industrial manufacturing, but often performance is limited due to insufficient training data. While ML models can benefit from collaboration, due to privacy concerns, individual manufacturers cannot share data directly. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of ML models without revealing raw data. However, current FL approaches fail to take the characteristics and requirements of industrial clients into account. In this work, we propose a FL system consisting of a process description and a software architecture to provide \\acrfull{flaas} to industrial clients deployed to edge devices. Our approach deals with skewed data by organizing clients into cohorts with similar data distributions. We evaluated the system on two industrial datasets. We show how the FLaaS approach provides FL to client processes by considering their requests submitted to the Industrial Federated Learning (IFL) Services API. Experiments on both industrial datasets and different FL algorithms show that the proposed cohort building can increase the ML model performance notably.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["745"]}
{"title": "Human-provided services\n", "abstract": " In this chapter, we discuss collaboration scenarios where people define services based on their dynamically changing skills and expertise by using Human-Provided Services. This approach is motivated by the need to support novel service-oriented applications in emerging crowdsourcing environments. In such open and dynamic environments, user participation is often driven by intrinsic incentives and actors properties such as reputation. We present a framework enabling users to define personal services to cope with complex interactions. We focus on the discovery and provisioning of human expertise in service-oriented environments.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["745"]}
{"title": "Crowdsourcing tasks in BPEL4People\n", "abstract": " In this chapter we extend BPEL4People with non-functional properties that allow to cope with the inherent dynamics of crowdsourcing processes. Such properties include human capabilities and the level of skills. We discuss the formation of social networks that are particularly beneficial for processing extended BPEL4People tasks. Furthermore, we present novel approaches for the automated assignment of tasks to a social group. The feasibility of our approach is shown through a proof of concept implementation of various concepts as well as simulations and experiments to evaluate our ranking and selection approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["745"]}
{"title": "Trust-based discovery and interactions in mixed service-oriented systems\n", "abstract": " Web-based collaborations and processes have become essential in todays business environments. Such processes typically span interactions between people and services across globally distributed companies. Web services and SOA are the defacto technology to implement compositions of humans and services. The increasing complexity of compositions and the distribution of people and services require adaptive and context-aware interaction models. To support complex interaction scenarios, we introduce a mixed service-oriented system composed of both human-provided and softwarebased services interacting to perform joint activities or to solve emerging problems. However, competencies of people evolve over time, thereby requiring approaches for the automated management of actor skills, reputation, and trust. Discovering the right actor in mixed service-oriented systems is challenging due to scale and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["745"]}

Publishing a service is as simple as posting a blog entry on the Web.

{"title": "inContext-Interaction and Context-based Technologies for Collaborative Teams\n", "abstract": " Much of today\u2019s teamwork is based on collaborative working environments (CWEs). These are supporting team members participating in multiple projects at the same time, with the work spanning multiple organisations and the team members working on the move. Virtual, nimble, and mobile teams evolve and merge reflecting the vibrant nature of human interactions. For such teamwork to be supported by computing, flexible, context-aware collaboration services are required. Collaboration environments need to exhibit capabilities for large-scale interactions, peer-to-peer communication, and dynamically adapting software services to enable efficient collaboration. In this paper we discuss how the new techniques and algorithms for relevance-based service aggregation and context-aware service provisioning developed in the inContext project enable dynamic collaboration.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["745"]}
{"title": "Pattern-based collaboration in ad-hoc teams through message annotation\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present a specification for annotating messages to enable computer-supported message processing, addressing, and analysis. The benefits of annotating messages according to our XML based specification are two-fold: Firstly, it allows computer support during collaboration by enabling automated message addressing (ie, determining who should get a message) and message management (eg, managing your messages according to activities, projects, and tasks). Secondly, it enables post-collaboration analysis of messages and mining of message logs for patterns and for workflow models. We provide a proof of concept by presenting how annotated messages may support and facilitate collaboration that happens according to certain collaboration patterns. In addition to the patterns we have already introduced in our previous work, we present more patterns such as Monitors that emphasize the applicability of computer supported message handling.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["745"]}
{"title": "Wireless internet applications\n", "abstract": " Web services provide the ability to design new exciting internet applications and innovative mobile applications. Web services are a family of XML-based standards designed for the communication of loosely coupled, dynamically bound applications. Web services can be seen as the evolution of the Web where not only humans interact with applications via HTML forms, but also applications interact directly with one another. Alternatively, Web services can be seen as a generalization of distributed object middleware, such as CORBA [15]. In whichever way one considers Web services, there is a strong trend towards the wide adoption of the technology as means for addressing interoperability issues.Web services are not only a recent technological hype, but are also defining a new way for designing applications and information systems. They are the most known incarnation of the programming paradigm known as\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["745"]}
