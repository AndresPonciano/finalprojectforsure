The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a variety of models to specify and measure software usability but these individual models do not support all usability aspects. Furthermore, they are not yet well integrated into current software engineering practices and lack tool support. The aim of this research is to survey the actual representation (meanings and interpretations) of usability in ISO standards, indicate some of existing limitations and address them by proposing an enhanced, normative model for the evaluation of software usability.", "num_citations": "700\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

From the point of view of the measurement scales used in its measurement process, FPA constitutes a potpourri of scales not admissible without the transformations imbedded in the implicit models of expert judgments. The results of this empirical study demonstrate that in a homogeneous environment not burdened with major differences in productivity factors there is a clear relationship between FPA's primary components and work-effort. This empirical study also indicates that there is such a relationship for each step of the FPA measurement process prior to the mixing of scales and the assignments of weights. Comparisons with FPA productivity models based on weights confirm, on the one hand, that the weights do not add information and, on the other, that the weights are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "197\n", "authors": ["1992"]}
{"title": "Can neural networks be easily interpreted in software cost estimation?\n", "abstract": " Software development effort estimation with the aid of neural networks has generally been viewed with skepticism by a majority of the software cost estimation community. Although, neural networks have shown their strengths in solving complex problems, their shortcoming of being 'black boxes' models has prevented them from being accepted as a common practice for cost estimation. In this paper, we study the interpretation of cost estimation models based on a backpropagation three layer perceptron network. Our proposed idea comprises mainly of the use of a method that maps this neural network to a fuzzy rule based system. Consequently, if the obtained fuzzy rules are easily interpreted, the neural network will also be easy to interpret. Our case study is based on the COCOMO'81 dataset.", "num_citations": "194\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Among the inadequacies identified (M.

However, in practice, many factors which describe software projects, such as the experience of programmers and the complexity of modules, are measured in terms of an ordinal (or nominal) scale composed of qualifications such as 'low' and 'high'. To overcome this limitation, we propose a set of new measures based on fuzzy logic for similarity when the software projects are described by categorical data.

The design of this tool is based on the direct mapping between COSMIC-FFP and UML concepts and notation, a foundation from which the required Rational Rose artifacts can be extracted to proceed to the software project measurement operation.

{"title": "The contribution of metrology concepts to understanding and clarifying a proposed framework for software measurement validation\n", "abstract": " In the software engineering literature, numerous practitioners and researchers have proposed hundreds of\" software measures\", or\" software metrics\". To help industry assess the quality of these proposed measures, various researchers have proposed various approaches to software measurement validation, none of which has yet been widely used by either designers or users of software measures. To tackle this diversity of validation approaches, Kitchenham et al. had proposed a framework for software measurement validation and suggested a critical review of their proposed framework. This paper performs such a review using a key ISO document on measurement, that is the ISO Vocabulary on Metrology as well as a measurement process model derived from an analysis of the individual validation proposals. The metrology concepts in particular have facilitated greater understanding of the set of measurement subconcepts that must be included in each of the steps from the design of a measurement method to the use of the measurement results.", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

{"title": "An analogy-based approach to estimation of software development effort using categorical data\n", "abstract": " Analogy-based software development effort estimation methods have proved to be a viable alternative to other conventional estimation methods since they mimic the human problem solving approach. However, they are limited by their inability to correctly handle categorical data. Therefore, we have proposed, in an earlier work, a new approach called fuzzy analogy which extends classical analogy by incorporating the fuzzy logic concept in the estimation process. The proposed approach may be applied only when the categorical values are derived from numerical data. This paper extends fuzzy analogy to deal with categorical values that are not derived from numerical data. To this aim, we used the fuzzy k-modes algorithm, a well-known clustering technique for large datasets containing categorical values. Thereafter, we evaluate the accuracy of fuzzy analogy construction-based on fuzzy k-modes using the ISBSG\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

FPA is based on a number of function types (external inputs, external outputs, external inquiries, internal logical files and external interface files), the set of which we refer to as a functional profile. It has been observed that a majority of projects within a sample are close to having an average functional profile, while some, of course, can be considered as outliers. This paper investigates the functional profiles within the ISBSG international repository, and whether or not productivity varies with such profiles. The results of the statistical analyses lead to distinct estimation models, depending on whether or not a project functional profile is within a reasonable range of the average functional profile for any particular sample.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

{"title": "Effort estimation with story points and cosmic function points-an industry case study\n", "abstract": " In Agile software projects developed using the Scrum process, Story Points are often used to estimate project effort. Story Points allow comparison of estimated effort with actual effort, but do not provide a size of the software developed and, therefore, do not allow determination of the productivity achieved on a project nor comparison of performance across projects and across organizations. In contrast to Story Points, international standards on functional size measurement, such as ISO 19761 (COSMIC Function Points), provide explicit measurement of software size for both estimation and benchmarking purposes. This study reports on the performance of estimation models built using Story Points and COSMIC Function Points and shows that, for the organization in which the data was collected, the use of COSMIC Function Points leads to estimation models with much smaller variances. The study also demonstrates that the use of COSMIC Function Points allows objective comparison of productivity across tasks within a Scrum environment.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

However, the user stories in the XP agile methodology do not provide auditors with enough evidence that certain steps and activities have been performed in compliance with ISO 9001. This paper proposes an extension to the user story, based on four sub processes related to the CMMI-DEV model: 1) identification of the source of the user story; 2) categorization of the non functional requirements; 3) identification of the user story relationships; and 4) prioritization of the user stories.

Therefore, techniques and solutions are needed to make DSML development easier and more accessible to software developers and domain experts. This paper recommends a list of success factors to consider when developing or choosing a DSML for those developing it, and for software developers and domain experts interested in using it. The paper then maps these success factors to a set of assessment criteria that can be used to assess DSML quality.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the quality of these input models in order to obtain high-quality software products. The detection of defects is a promising technique to evaluate software quality, which is emerging as a suitable alternative for MDD processes. The detection of defects in conceptual models is usually manually performed. However, since current MDD standards and technologies allow both the specification of metamodels to represent conceptual models and the implementation of model transformations to automate the generation of final software products, it is possible to automate defect detection from the defined conceptual models. This paper presents a quality model that not only encapsulates defect types that are related to conceptual models but also takes advantage of current standards in order to automate defect detection in MDD environments.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Metadata harvesting and metadata enrichments could represent a way to help users to find content and events according to their interests. However, metadata are underused and represents an interoperability challenge. This paper presents a new framework, called SMESE, and the implementation of its prototypes that consists of its semantic metadata model, a mapping ontology model and a user interest affinity model. This proposed framework makes these models interoperable with existing metadata models. SMESE also proposes a decision support process supporting the activation and deactivation of software features related to metadata. To consider context variability into account in modeling context-aware properties, SMESE makes use of an autonomous process that exploits context information to adapt software behavior using an enhanced metadata framework. When the user chooses preferences in terms of system behavior, the semantic weight of each feature is computed. This weight quantifies the importance of the feature for the user according to their interests. This paper also proposed a semantic metadata analysis ecosystem to support data harvesting according to a metadata model and a mapping ontology model. Data harvesting is coupled with internal and external enrichments. The initial SMESE prototype represents more than 400 millions of relationships (triplets). To conclude, this paper also presents the design and implementation of different prototypes of SMESE applied to digital ecosystems.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Many studies have observed that the potential for reuse in software goes far beyond the reuse of source lines of code and includes data, architecture, design, program and common subsystem modules, documentation, test data and various intangibles. These issues are not tackled by reuse metrics based only on lines of code as the unit of measurement. In 1995, Abran and Desharnais proposed the rst version of functional reuse metrics based on the Function Point Analysis (FPA) technique. They illustrated how these metrics could be used to take into account the bene ts of reuse in a cost-bene t analysis. We are currently working on the re nement and extension of these functional reuse metrics. This empirical research project includes three phases:(1) test of the proposed functional metrics with other industrial datasets;(2) exploration of its limitations and potential extensions, through the design of much more complex simulated case studies using the data collected in the rst phase of the project; and (3) design and test of an improved version of the proposed metrics.

{"title": "Analysis of the measurement process of Function Points Analysis\n", "abstract": " Function Points metrics were developed by Allan Albrecht in 1979 to study software development productivity. There is, however, considerable ambiguity on their interpretation: in the literature they are reported to be either a size measurement, a productivity unit, a functional complexity factor, a dimensionless number or a multidimensional number. Simultaneously, there is ample evidence in the literature that there is an empirical relationship between function points and development work effort.An analysis of the measurement processes embedded within function points (FP) reveals that the FP metrics include both a measurement model and a productivity model. Within the measurement model the software user deliverables are identified and decomposed into functions and elementary components which are individually counted within the same measurement scales.

In this study, we performed a systematic mapping and review on SPMP studies to analyze and summarize the empirical evidence on the prediction accuracy of SPMP techniques in current research. Objective: The objective of this study is twofold:(1) to classify SPMP studies reported in the literature using the following criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, empirical approach, software application type, datasets, independent variables used as predictors, dependent variables (eg how maintainability is expressed in terms of the variable to be predicted), tools used to gather the predictors, the successful predictors and SPMP techniques,(2) to analyze these studies from three perspectives: prediction accuracy, techniques reported to be superior in comparative studies and accuracy comparison of these techniques. Methodology: We performed a systematic mapping and review of the SPMP empirical studies published from 2000 up to 2018 based on an automated search of nine electronic databases. Results: We identified 82 primary studies and classified them according to the above criteria. The mapping study revealed that most studies were solution proposals using a history-based empirical evaluation approach, the datasets most used were historical using object-oriented software applications, maintainability in terms of the independent variable to be predicted was most frequently expressed in terms of the number\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Systems engineers must subsequently apportion these system requirements very carefully as either software or hardware requirements to conform to the maintainability requirements of the system. A number of concepts are provided in the ECSS, ISO 9126, and IEEE standards to describe the various types of candidate maintainability requirements at the system, software, and hardware levels. This paper organizes these concepts into a generic standards-based reference model of the requirements at the software level for system maintainability. The structure of this reference model is based on the generic model of software requirements proposed in the COSMIC\u2013ISO 19761 model, thereby allowing the measurement of the functional size of such maintainability requirements implemented through software.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Due to its importance, there are supportive documents, guidelines, and experiences with software measurement in industrial software engineering settings that can be a significant aid for organizations willing to shoulder its implementation. But establishing and sustaining a software measurement process in a particular industrial environment is often regarded as a difficult venture; these ventures are not infrequently reported to fail in practice. It is the dedicated task of this research project to address the lack of maturity in implementing and sustaining software measurement processes in software engineering industry through a stepwise process improvement model along the measurement paradigms. In order to tackle that issue, the engineering research path is taken to be able to adopt advantageous features of prior, incomplete attempts to the problem. Part I of the thesis deals with the observation and evaluation of those existing solutions using previously elicited criteria in terms of required content-and model-related properties of software measurement process improvement models. Starting from the evaluation\u2019s results, the most promising of the prior solution attempts is adopted as basis model and its shortcoming is analyzed.

{"title": "Estimation models for software functional test effort\n", "abstract": " The International Software Benchmarking and Standards Group (ISBSG) data-base was used to build estimation models for estimating software functional test effort. The analysis of the data revealed three test productivity patterns representing economies or diseconomies of scale and these patterns served as a basis for investigating the characteristics of the corresponding projects. Three groups of projects related to the three different productivity patterns, characterized by domain, team size, elapsed time and rigor of verification and validation carried out during development, were found to be statistically significant. Within each project group, the variations in test effort can be explained, in addition to functional size, by 1) the processes executed during development, and 2) the processes adopted for testing. Portfolios of estimation models were built using combinations of the three independent variables. Performance of the estimation models built using the function point method innovated by the Common Software Measurement International Consortium (COSMIC) known as COSMIC Function Points, and the one advocated by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG) known as IFPUG Function Points, were compared to evaluate the impact of these respective sizing methods on test effort estimation.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

{"title": "A semi-formal method to verify correctness of functional requirements specifications of complex systems\n", "abstract": " Many standards mandating verification of requirements correctness do not comprehensively state what information should be captured and used for verification and quality assurance activities. Therefore, a wide range of methods, from simplistic checklists to comprehensive formal methods, is used to verify correctness of system and software requirements. In this paper, a semi-formal method to verify functional requirements using a graphical logic-based structured architecture referred to as Graphical Requirement Analysis is proposed and illustrated with a case study. Its architecture allows to trace functional system requirements and to show correctness (non-ambiguity, consistency, completeness) of specifications. The support of graphical system engineering descriptions greatly facilitates to simulate requirement specifications and designs.

The aim of this evaluation is to compare the functional size of each app measured using the COSMIC method to the score of the app obtained in a previous evaluation that relied on functions extraction using a quality assessment questionnaire. The shift between the rankings of both evaluations was small for the majority of the selected apps. Therefore the findings of this study support the use of the COSMIC method for these apps in regards to measuring the functional size for further updates or improvements. Moreover, the use of COSMIC is more effective since it covers the full features and functionalities of mPHRs for pregnancy monitoring.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

{"title": "A semantic metadata enrichment software ecosystem based on sentiment and emotion metadata enrichments\n", "abstract": " Information retrieval and analysis is frequently used to extract meaningful knowledge from the unstructured web and long texts. As existing computer search engines struggle to understand the meaning of natural language, semantically sentiment and emotion enriched metadata may improve search engine capabilities and user finding. A semantic metadata enrichment software ecosystem (SMESE) has been proposed in our previous research. This paper presents an enhanced version of this ecosystem with a sentiment and emotion metadata enrichments algorithm. This paper proposes a model and an algorithm enhancing search engines finding contents according to the user interests, through text analysis approaches for sentiment and emotion analysis. It presents the design, implementation and evaluation of an engine harvesting and enriching metadata related to sentiment and emotion analysis. It includes the SSEA (Semantic Sentiment and Emotion Analysis) semantic model and algorithm that discover and enrich sentiment and emotion metadata hidden within the text or linked to multimedia structure. The performance of sentiment and emotion analysis enrichments is evaluated using a number of prototype simulations by comparing them to existing enriched metadata techniques. The results show that the algorithm SSEA enable greater understanding and finding of document or contents associated with sentiment and emotion enriched metadata.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

COSMIC FFP measures the software functional user requirements and is applicable throughout the development life cycle, right from the requirements phase to the implementation and maintenance phases. This method has been designed to measure the functional size of management information time software, and multilayer systems. Since many of the software systems targeted by the COSMIC FFP method are large-scale and inherently complex, feedback on this complexity would provide additional information to improve its effective management throughout the software life cycle: in Alagar et al.(2000) an entropybased measure of functional complexity has been proposed. This paper presents a study of the scales, units, and scale types of both COSMIC FFP and an entropy-based functional complexity measure.

{"title": "A case study using the cosmic-ffp measurement method for assessing real-time system specifications\n", "abstract": " The success of a system development project largely depends on the nonambiguity of its system-level requirements specification document, where the requirements are described at the system level rather than at the software and hardware level. There may be missing details about the allocation of functions between hardware and software, both for the developers who will have to implement such requirements later on, and for the software measurers who have to immediately attempt to measure the software functional size of such requirements.. The result of different interpretations of the specification problem would lead to different software being built, and of different functional size. The research described in this paper is concerned with the challenges inherent in understanding the initial system requirements in textual form and assessing the codesign decisions using the functional size measurement. This paper aimed at understanding the applicability of the COSMIC-FFP functional size measurement method in assessing the hardware-software requirements allocation, and illustrates the approach on a Steam Boiler Controller case study.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

The benefits of this technology, such as reuse, enhanced quality and relatively short application development time, have been key drivers of its industrial adoption. However, in its progress towards maturity, component technology has suffered from a number of limitations, such as unused component members (data and functionalities). For instance, a reusable software component incorporates a set of members, a sizevarying subset of which is actually used to satisfy the functional requirements of a particular software application. This means that a complementary subset of unused members will persist in the deployed application, where this subset provides no functional value to the host application. Furthermore, these unused members can consume memory and network resources and might compromise application integrity and/or security if they are exploited inappropriately. In this paper, we propose CoMet, a prototype tool which applies CUMM (Component Unused Member Measurement) method to measure unused component members (attributes and functionalities) and their usage percentages in a software application.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

In this paper, the impact of cluster center initialization on improving the prediction accuracy of 2FA\u2010kprototypes was analyzed and discussed using two cluster initialization techniques: centrality\u2010based initialization and density\u2010based initialization. The performance of 2FA\u2010kprototypes using these two initialization techniques was evaluated\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

The different components and dimensions of this gap are identified and an approach is proposed to address them. The purpose of this approach is to improve early functional size estimation and, in turn, improve effort estimation. For the purposes of this paper, the ISO 19761 COSMIC standard on functional size measurement is taken as reference for discussion, while the majority of concepts presented are generic to most other similar ISO standards.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Despite some successes in software, there are few mechanisms for the developers to rapidly and objectively verify and track the amount of functionality to be delivered. COSMIC\u2013ISO 19761 functional size measurement can be used to keep track of software through its development life cycle. In this paper, we propose a \u201cJavaCFP\u201d plugin tool for measuring the COSMIC functional size of java source code being developed. This JavaCFP tool can be used for controlling the completeness of implemented functionality against specified requirements, for identifying deviations and for generating progress reports on the implementation of new functions.

{"title": "POMA: A Pattern-Oriented and Model-Driven Architecture\n", "abstract": " Day-to-day experience suggests that it is not enough to approach a complex design armed with design tips, guidelines, and hints. Developers must also be able to use proven solutions emerging from the best design practices to solve new design challenges. Without these, the designer will not be able to properly apply guidelines or take full advantage of the power of technology, resulting in poor performance, poor scalability, and poor usability. Furthermore, the designer may \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d when attempting to implement a design solution. A number of design problems continue to arise, such as:(1) decoupling the various aspects of interactive systems (for example, business logic, the UI, navigation, and information architecture; and (2) isolating platform specifics from the concerns common to all interactive systems. In the context of a proposal for a Pattern-Oriented and Model-Driven Architecture (POMA) for interactive systems, this paper identifies an extensive list of patterns categories, and types of models aimed at providing a pool of proven solutions to these problems. The models of patterns span several levels of abstraction, such as domain, task, dialog, presentation, and layout. The proposed POMA architecture illustrates how several individual models can be combined at different levels of abstraction into heterogeneous structures, which can then be used as building blocks in the development of interactive systems.First, we describe the architectural levels and the categories of patterns, as well as the various relationships between patterns; second, we propose five categories of models to address the problems described above which are\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

{"title": "A data security framework for cloud computing services\n", "abstract": " Cyberattacks are difficult to prevent because the targeted companies and organizations are often relying on new and fundamentally insecure cloudbased technologies, such as the Internet of Things. With increasing industry adoption and migration of traditional computing services to the cloud, one of the main challenges in cybersecurity is to provide mechanisms to secure these technologies. This work proposes a Data Security Framework for cloud computing services (CCS) that evaluates and improves CCS data security from a software engineering perspective by evaluating the levels of security within the cloud computing paradigm using engineering methods and techniques applied to CCS. This framework is developed by means of a methodology based on a heuristic theory that incorporates knowledge generated by existing works as well as the experience of their implementation. The paper presents the design details of the framework, which consists of three stages: identification of data security requirements, management of data security risks and evaluation of data security performance in CCS.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Yet no clear conclusions have been drawn on which techniques perform best in all contexts. We propose an entropy\u2010based approach to effort estimate variation caused by measurement and model error sources whatever the effort estimation technique used. The proposed approach was empirically evaluated by exploring three entropy formulae, four interpolation methods, and two analogy\u2010based effort estimation approaches (crisp and fuzzy analogy) over seven datasets using the Jackknife evaluation method. The obtained results show that the three entropy formulae have in general the same positive influence on the performance of the entropy\u2010based approach measured in terms of absolute error of effort deviation.

From the initial realm of research with a focus on innovation and creativity, its scaling up in industry requires improved planning, monitoring and control of the development and implementation process.

{"title": "Improved Effort Estimation of Heterogeneous Ensembles using Filter Feature Selection.\n", "abstract": " Estimating the amount of effort required to develop a new software system remains the main activity in software project management. Thus, providing an accurate estimate is essential to adequately manage the software lifecycle. For that purpose, many paradigms have been proposed in the literature, among them Ensemble Effort Estimation (EEE). EEE consists of predicting the effort of the new project using more than one single predictor. This paper aims at improving the prediction accuracy of heterogeneous ensembles whose members use filter feature selection. Three groups of ensembles were constructed and evaluated: ensembles without feature selection, ensembles with one filter, and ensembles with different filters. The overall results suggest that the use of different filters lead to generate more accurate heterogeneous ensembles, and that the ensembles whose members use one filter were the worst ones.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

What is the impact on the accuracy of estimation models built from imputed datasets when simple and multiple imputation techniques are used to replace missing data?METHOD: This study used both simple and multiple imputation techniques with either absolute or relative seeds, to build effort estimation models and then applied regressions on these imputed datasets to compare their respective performance. The performance of imputation techniques was investigated using data from projects within the ISBSG dataset release 9with data for all project phases divided into two subsets: subset X consisting of complete data fields for all project phases and subset Y consisting of information from which implementation activity data is deleted. Subset X was used as the training dataset for the imputation and for building the estimation model from multiple regression analysis, which was then applied to subset Y with the missing values. The performance of the effort prediction models, both estimated effort and actual effort, were then evaluated using three evaluation criteria: adjusted R2, MMRE, and Pred (25).RESULTS: The key findings are: 1. When only the absolute value was calculated, multiple imputation with absolute seeds performed much better in comparison to simple imputation with an absolute\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

The classical approach to building estimation models in software engineering is to build a single estimation model and include within it as many cost factors (ie independent variables) as possible. In this paper, we do not postulate that there exists a single estimation model that is ideal in all circumstances, but rather we report on exploratory research conducted over the past few years looking at relevant concepts from the field of economics and from discussions with organizations attempting to understand the data that they have collected on their projects.

Sin embargo, no ha sido hasta el estallido del\" punto COM\", cuando las patentes de software han jugado un papel significativo en la econom\u00eda del software. En Europa, con legislaci\u00f3n distinta a la estadounidense, las patentes en general se regulan por el Convenio de la Patente Europea de Munich del 1973 (CPE). En \u00e9l se cita expl\u00edcitamente a los programas de ordenador como un sujeto no patentable. Sin embargo, la Oficina Europea de Patentes (OEP) hace imaginativas interpretaciones favorables a la masiva patentabilidad de software, constituyendo \u00e9sta su pr\u00e1ctica actual. Los pocos juicios de relevancia que se est\u00e1n produciendo en la Uni\u00f3n Europea est\u00e1n decant\u00e1ndose mayormente por una interpretaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s restrictiva a la patentabilidad del software y m\u00e1s cercana a la postura contraria a la misma del Parlamento Europeo en la recientemente rechazada directiva de patentes de software. En Espa\u00f1a se puede concluir que existe una ley de las m\u00e1s restrictivas de Europa en cuanto a la patentabilidad del software, aunque esto no evita que tambi\u00e9n exista cierta controversia legal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

Vincenti, en su libro\" Lo que saben los ingenieros y c\u00f3mo lo saben\", ha propuesto una taxonom\u00eda del conocimiento de ingenier\u00eda. La Ingenier\u00eda del Software, como disciplina, ciertamente no est\u00e1 todav\u00eda tan madura como otras disciplinas de ingenier\u00eda y algunos autores incluso se han cuestionado la noci\u00f3n de que la Ingenier\u00eda del Software sea de hecho una ingenier\u00eda. Para investigar este asunto, las categor\u00edas de Vincenti de conocimiento de la ingenier\u00eda se utilizan para analizar la Gu\u00eda SWEBOK (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge) desde la perspectiva de la ingenier\u00eda. Este art\u00edculo presenta una descripci\u00f3n de las categor\u00edas de Vincenti de conocimiento en la ingenier\u00eda, seguidas por un an\u00e1lisis del concepto de dise\u00f1o en la ingenier\u00eda de Vincenti en comparaci\u00f3n con el concepto de dise\u00f1o de la Gu\u00eda SWEBOK: esto resalta en particular el hecho de que el concepto de dise\u00f1o de la ingenier\u00eda de Vincenti no est\u00e1 limitado al \u00e1rea del conocimiento de la fase del dise\u00f1o de la Gu\u00eda SWEBOK, sino que impregna muchas de las \u00e1reas del conocimiento de SWEBOK. Finalmente, el \u00e1rea del conocimiento de la calidad del software de SWEBOK se selecciona como caso de estudio, y se analiza usando la clasificaci\u00f3n de Vincenti de conocimiento de la ingenier\u00eda.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1992"]}

{"title": "Software assets management\u2013modeling issues and proposed models\n", "abstract": " Too often, software intensive organizations can only track the initial assignment of a software to a resource but not necessarily thereafter. In such organizations, Software Asset Management (SAM) is often a reactive process. The lack of defined software asset management processes limits the ability of several organizations to manage the whereabouts of software once it is assigned to a resource. This puts the organization in a passive role so it is important to add planning and control processes, including for the retirement of software. To improve management of assets, the IT industry can learn from other disciplines, in particular from public works engineering. Through active assets management an organization will be better positioned to make choices to optimize and tune its Software Asset portfolio while complying with corporate policies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1992"]}
{"title": "New Approaches in Software Measurement: 10th International Workshop, IWSM 2000, Berlin, Germany, October 4-6, 2000. Proceedings\n", "abstract": " Software measurement is one of the key technologies employed to control and manage the software development process. Research avenues such as the applicability of metrics, the efficiency of measurement programs in industry, and the theoretical foundations (of software engineering?) have been investigated to evaluate and improve modern software development areas such as object-orientation, compone-based develop-ment, multimedia systems design, reliable telecommunication systems etc. In the tradition of our software measurement research communities, the German Computer Science Interest (GI) Group on Software Measurement and the Canadian Interest Group in Software Metrics (CIM) have attended to these concerns in recent years. Initially, research initiatives were directed at the definition of new methods of software measurement and the validation of these methods themselves. This was then followed by more and more investigation into practical applications of software measurement and key findings in this area of software engineering have been published in:-Dumke/Zuse: Theory and Practice of Software Measurement, 1994-Ebert/Dumke: Software-Metriken in der Praxis, 1996-Lehner/Dumke/Abran: Software Metrics-Research and Practice in Software Measurement, 1997-Dumke/Abran: Software Measurement-Current Trends in Research and Practice, 1999 We would also like to mention that the proceedings of the Lac Sup\u00e9rieur workshop have been made available on the web at www. lrgl. uqam. ca?

{"title": "Mapping processes between parallel, hierarchical, and orthogonal system representations\n", "abstract": " The importance of software system representation through models and visual diagrams is increasing with the steady growth of systems complexity and criticality. Since no single representation is best suited to address all the documentation, communication and expression needs of a typical software development project, the issues related to conversion and coherence between different representations are having a significant impact on team productivity and product as well as process quality. This paper explores the types of relationships that exist between representations and the impact they have on mapping, generation and synchronization processes. We propose a characterization of those relationships as being parallel, hierarchical or orthogonal. Examples and comments on mapping or transformation processes and automation prospects in the context of software size measurement are also provided.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1992"]}
