{"title": "Proceso de Desarrollo de Software mediante herramientas MDA\n", "abstract": " El enfoque Model Driven Architecture (MDA) esta centrado en los modelos y sus transformaciones, en donde para dirigir el proceso de desarrollo de software se requiere de transformaciones cada vez m\u00e1s detalladas. En el desarrollo de software dirigido por modelos las transformaciones de modelos son consideradas como activos importantes que deben ser manejadas con principios s\u00f3lidos de ingenier\u00eda de software: estas transformaciones deben ser analizadas, dise\u00f1adas, implementadas, probadas, mantenidas y sujetas a la administraci\u00f3n de configuraci\u00f3n. Debido a esto existe la necesidad de identificar los modelos y sus caracter\u00edsticas, t\u00e9cnicas y m\u00e9todos que permitan el desarrollo de transformaciones y su mantenimiento. Este trabajo describe el estudio de herramientas MDA para mostrar una visi\u00f3n de lo que hace falta para adoptar este enfoque. Adem\u00e1s se presentan trabajos relacionados con respecto a cada uno de los modelos de MDA y sus transformaciones, para describir el grado de definici\u00f3n de estos. La aportaci\u00f3n de este trabajo es la comparativa de herramientas y trabajos relacionados, que ayuda a obtener informaci\u00f3n de lo que existe en la actualidad sobre el Model Driven Development (MDD), as\u00ed como identificar las \u00e1reas de mejora y los posibles trabajos futuros que permitan complementar las caracter\u00edsticas que MDA persigue.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["403"]}
{"title": "National consensus on the cardiological treatment and follow-up of Kawasaki disease\n", "abstract": " Kawasaki disease is a self-limiting acute vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized vessels, and is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in our environment. Up to 25% of untreated patients develop coronary aneurysms. It is suspected that an infectious agent may be the trigger of the disease, but the causative agent is still unknown. Based on the previous evidence, recommendations are proposed for the diagnosis, treatment of acute disease, and the long-term management of these patients, in order to unify criteria. The diagnosis must be quick, based on easy-to-use algorithms and with the support of complementary tests. This document includes the indication of available imaging techniques, as well as the planning of cardiological examinations based on the initial involvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin is the basis of the initial treatment. The role of corticosteroids is still controversial\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["403"]}
{"title": "Optimization of the K-means Algorithm for the Solution of High Dimensional Instances\n", "abstract": " This paper addresses the problem of clustering instances with a high number of dimensions. In particular, a new heuristic for reducing the complexity of the K-means algorithm is proposed. Traditionally, there are two approaches that deal with the clustering of instances with high dimensionality. The first executes a preprocessing step to remove those attributes of limited importance. The second, called divide and conquer, creates subsets that are clustered separately and later their results are integrated through post-processing. In contrast, this paper proposes a new solution which consists of the reduction of distance calculations from the objects to the centroids at the classification step. This heuristic is derived from the visual observation of the clustering process of K-means, in which it was found that the objects can only migrate to adjacent clusters without crossing distant clusters. Therefore, this heuristic can\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["403"]}
{"title": "A Graphical Visualization Tool for Analyzing the Behavior of Metaheuristic Algorithm\n", "abstract": " This paper proposes a visualization tool for analyzing the behavior of metaheuristic algorithms. It works by reproducing graphically the solutions generated in execution time. The tool was evaluated analyzing the Hybrid Grouping Genetic Algorithm for Bin Packing (HGGA_BP). It was used to solve a benchmark with 17 instances of the one dimensional Bin Packing problem (1D-BPP). The use of the visualization tool allowed identifying some logical errors in the program code which avoided the algorithm converge in some cases to the optimal solution. After correcting errors the HGGA_BP algorithm increased its efficiency until 48%, in some cases.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["403"]}
{"title": "Improving the Efficiency of the K-medoids Clustering Algorithm by Getting Initial Medoids\n", "abstract": " The conventional K-medoids algorithm is one of the most used clustering algorithms, however, one of its limitations is its sensitivity to initial medoids. The generation of optimized initial medoids, which increases the efficiency and effectiveness of K-medoids is proposed. The initial medoids are obtained in two steps, in the first one the data are grouped with an efficient variant of algorithm K-means denominated Early Classification. In the second step, the centroids generated by K-means are transformed into optimized initial medoids. The proposed approach was validated by solving a set of real data sets and compared with the K-medoids algorithm solution. Based on the obtained results it was determined that our approach reduced the time an average of 68%. The quality results of our approach were compared using several well-known validation indexes, and the values were very similar.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["403"]}
{"title": "CWSLR Model Used to Synthesize a Software Development Environment and an Application Design Tool.\n", "abstract": " A Software Engineering environment, the Cooperative Work Software Process (CWSP), and a design tool, the Cooperative Work Application Design (CWAD) are described. Both are based on the Cooperative Work Storage, Logic, and Resources model (CWSLR). A simplified version of the model is used to drive de user interface, and the structure of the model determines the control flow of the design process supported by CWAD. Utilization of the model is enabled because its components are explicitly related in abstraction hierarchies, and each dimension elaborates on simple predefined structures.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["403"]}
{"title": "CWSLR Model for CSCW Information Systems.\n", "abstract": " Cooperative Work (CSCW) information systems is to improve the performance of people cooperating in organizations through the use of information technology. This is a complex goal, which needs a framework to guide their conception and validation. This framework is based on the main factors of an information system, namely the organizational memory, the organizational resources and their logical structure. The model presented in this paper is the Cooperative Work Storage, Logic, and Resources (CWSLR), built around these three factors, each one corresponding to an axis. This orthogonal three-dimensional structure allows visualizing the relationships among the axes, when an instance of a given application is considered. These explicit relations give the possibility to assess the application structure in order to guide its development toward CSCW style architectures. The cooperation as a main goal the CWSLR model is based on coordination by results. This approach allows follow the natural practices currently found in organizations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["403"]}
