{"title": "Evaluating GQM+ Strategies Framework for Planning Measurement System\n", "abstract": " Context. Most organizations are aware of the significance of software measurement programs to help organizations assess and improve the ways they develop software. Measurement plays a vital role in improving software process and products. However, the number of failing measurement programs is high and the reasons are vary. A recent approach for planning measurement programs is GQM+ Strategies, which makes an important extension to existing approaches, it links measurements and improvement activities to strategic goals and ways to achieve this goals. However, concrete guides of how to collect the information needed to use GQM+ strategies is not provided in the literature yet.Objectives. The contribution of this research is to propose and assess an elicitation approach (The Goal Strategy Elicitation (GSE) approach) for the information needed to apply GQM+ strategies in an organization, which also leads to a partial evaluation of GQM+ strategies as such. In this thesis, the initial focus is placed on eliciting the goals and strategies in the most efficient way.Methods. The primary research approach used is action research, which allows to flexibly assess a new method or technique in an iterative manner, where the feedback of one iteration is taken into the next iteration, thus improving on the method or technique proposed. Complementary to that, we used literature review with the primary focus to position the work, explore GQM+ strategies, and to determine which elicitation approach for the support of measurement programs have been proposed.Results. The Goal Strategy Elicitation (GSE) approach as a tool for eliciting goals and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1290"]}
