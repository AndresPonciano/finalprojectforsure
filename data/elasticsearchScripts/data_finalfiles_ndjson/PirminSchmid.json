At a range of times in culture from 2 days to 1 month (long enough for cartilage\u2010like material properties to begin to emerge), pericellular distributions of proteoglycan and matrix protein deposition were measured by quantitative autoradiography, while matrix accumulation and cell volumes were estimated by stereological methods. Consistent with previous work, tissue\u2010average rates of matrix synthesis generally decreased asymptotically with time in culture, as de novo matrix accumulated. Cell\u2010scale analysis revealed that this evolution was accompanied by a transition from predominantly pericellular matrix (within a few \u03bcm from the cell membrane) deposition early in culture towards proteoglycan and protein\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["1660"]}

One method (method A1, 3) calculates a rank or an index p (n+1) with p representing the centile (which is the percentile divided by 100) and n the sample size. Method B4 calculates an index 0.5+pn.

{"title": "Codon usage in vertebrates is associated with a low risk of acquiring nonsense mutations\n", "abstract": " Codon usage in genomes is biased towards specific subsets of codons. Codon usage bias affects translational speed and accuracy, and it is associated with the tRNA levels and the GC content of the genome. Spontaneous mutations drive genomes to a low GC content. Active cellular processes are needed to maintain a high GC content, which influences the codon usage of a species. Loss-of-function mutations, such as nonsense mutations, are the molecular basis of many recessive alleles, which can greatly affect the genome of an organism and are the cause of many genetic diseases in humans. We developed an event based model to calculate the risk of acquiring nonsense mutations in coding sequences. Complete coding sequences and genomes of 40 eukaryotes were analyzed for GC and CpG content, codon usage, and the associated risk of acquiring nonsense mutations. We included one species per genus for all eukaryotes with available reference sequence. We discovered that the codon usage bias detected in genomes of high GC content decreases the risk of acquiring nonsense mutations (Pearson's r = -0.95; P < 0.0001). In the genomes of all examined vertebrates, including humans, this risk was lower than expected (0.93 \u00b1 0.02; mean \u00b1 SD) and lower than the risk in genomes of non-vertebrates (1.02 \u00b1 0.13; P = 0.019). While the maintenance of a high GC content is energetically costly, it is associated with a codon usage bias harboring a low risk of acquiring nonsense mutations.

The aim, therefore, was the establishment of an OIAT with defining reference values of plasma iron in healthy volunteers.METHODS: We included 49 healthy volunteers who received 200 mg of bivalent ferrous fumarate in fasting condition and measured plasma iron after 2 and 4 hours as well as after 3 and 5 days. After a wash-out phase, 23 healthy volunteers proceeded to receive trivalent iron hydroxide polymaltose in fasting condition, and 11 participants were tested without iron.RESULTS: Reference values of absolute and relative plasma iron after oral iron ingestion could be established. There was a significant increase of plasma iron after bivalent iron intake within 4 hours after ingestion (absolute increase after 4h: from initially 17\u00b14 \u00b5mol/l to 35\u00b112 \u00b5mol/l in females and from 21\u00b17 \u00b5mol/l to 33\u00b111 \u00b5mol/l in males, relative plasma iron concentration (defined reference: 1.0) after 4 h: 2.1\u00b10.7 in females and 1.7\u00b10.6 in males). There was no relevant increase with trivalent iron nor without iron. Relative iron increase correlates to iron storage. In general, females had lower ferritin levels and thus higher increases of plasma iron.CONCLUSION: An OIAT in healthy volunteers could be established. Its prospective validation using bivalent iron in iron deficiency is desirable.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1660"]}
{"title": "SimFS: A Simulation Data Virtualizing File System Interface\n", "abstract": " Nowadays simulations can produce petabytes of data to be stored in parallel filesystems or large-scale databases. This data is accessed over the course of decades often by thousands of analysts and scientists. However, storing these volumes of data for long periods of time is not cost effective and, in some cases, practically impossible. We propose to transparently virtualize the simulation data, relaxing the storage requirements by not storing the full output and re-simulating the missing data on demand. We develop SimFS, a file system interface that exposes a virtualized view of the simulation output to the analysis applications and manages the re-simulations. SimFS monitors the access patterns of the analysis applications in order to (1) decide the data to keep stored for faster accesses and (2) to employ prefetching strategies to reduce the access time of missing data. Virtualizing simulation data allows us to trade\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1660"]}
