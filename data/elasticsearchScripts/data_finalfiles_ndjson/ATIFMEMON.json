A popular technique to detect defects in GUIs is to test them by executing test cases and checking the execution results. Test cases may either be created manually or generated automatically from a model of the GUI. While manual testing is unacceptably slow for many applications, our experience with GUI testing has shown that creating a model that can be used for automated test case generation is difficult. We describe a new approach to reverse engineer a model represented as structures called a GUI forest, event-flow graphs and an integration tree directly from the executable GUI. We describe \u201cGUI Ripping\u201d, a dynamic process in which the software\u2019s GUI is automatically \u201ctraversed\u201d by opening all its windows and extracting all their widgets (GUI objects), properties, and values.

The event-driven nature of GUIs presents new challenges for testing. One important challenge is test suite reduction.

Moreover, many existing techniques ignore code in libraries and fail to consider the context in which event handlers execute. Consequently, they yield GUI test suites with seriously impaired fault-detection abilities. This paper presents a reduction technique based on the call-stack coverage criterion.

During these builds, software is compiled, linked, and (re)tested with the goal of validating its basic functionality. Although successful for conventional software, smoke tests are difficult to develop and automatically rerun for software that has a graphical user interface (GUI). In this paper, we describe a framework called DART (daily automated regression tester) that addresses the needs of frequent and automated re-testing of GUI software. The key to our success is automation: DART automates everything from structural GUI analysis; test case generation; test oracle creation; to code instrumentation; test execution; coverage evaluation; regeneration of test cases; and their re-execution.

As one of us wrote recently in another context,\u201cIf sheer neglect of a topic can justify its being studied, then surely our question is answered\u201d(Halpern & Bartlett, 2002). The voluminous literature on eyewitness testimony includes many thousands of studies assessing young-adult performance and a growing number of studies (certainly several hundred) assessing performance by children. By contrast, the major journals for work on aging and cognition (eg, Psychology and Aging, Journal of Gerontology), contain only a sprinkling of articles on aging and eyewitness performance, and the major journals publishing eyewitness research (eg, Law and Human Behavior, Legal and Criminological Psychology, Applied Cognitive Psychology) contain fewer still. This situation needs changing for at least three different reasons. The first is simply the need to establish the generality and ecological validity\u2014and forensic applicability\u2014of our research findings. Young adults like those used in most eyewitness studies are not the only witnesses to crime in real life. Middle-aged and older adults are more likely to witness crimes (Bornstein, 1995) and often are asked to view identification lineups (Rothmans, Dunlop, & Entzel, 2000) and testify in other ways. We clearly need to know if the conclusions we have reached in assessing young adults and children apply to other age groups.The second reason pertains to recent evidence (eg, Yarmey, Jones, & Rashid, 1984; 1984: Ross, Dunning, Toglia, & Ceci, 1990; Kwong See, Hoffman, &Wood, 2001) that, although older eyewitnesses are perceived by mock jurors as honest\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Results from 456 test case executions in each tool show, with statistical significance, that the component-based approach reports more false negatives than VGT for acceptance tests but that the VGT approach reports more false positives for system tests. Second, a case study is performed with larger open source applications, ranging from 8,803-55,006 lines of code.

Hypermnesia (an increase in total amount of information recalled in the repeated interview) occurred without any decrease in the overall accuracy.

The number of errors, increased across the interviews, but the relative accuracy of participants\u2019 responses was unaffected. However, when accuracy was calculated based on all unique details provided across both interviews and compared to the accuracy of recall in just the first interview it was found to be slightly lower. The identity of the interviewer (whether the same or different across interviews) had no effects on the number of correct details. There was an increase in recall of new details with little cost to the overall accuracy of information gathered.

Due to the way that GUI test cases are often implemented, relatively minor changes to the construction of the GUI can cause a large number of test case executions to malfunction, often because GUI elements referred to by the test cases have been renamed, moved, or otherwise altered. We posit that a general solution to the problem of GUI test case maintenance must be based on heuristics that attempt to match an applicationpsilas GUI elements across versions.

A dual task manipulation was used to prevent participants from ruminating over a video that depicted an abduction and attack. Several indices of recall showed greater memory for emotional event details than for details from a neutral control video, which remained the case when the opportunity for poststimulus elaboration was prevented. Thus, superior retention of the content of emotional experiences may arise from the way in which arousal is induced rather than through immediate postevent cognitions.", "num_citations": "44\n", "authors": ["302"]}

The secondary objectives were to establish a link between serum homocysteine levels and maternal age, parity, gestational age, foetal birth weight, mean arterial pressure and albuminuria. Methods: A total of 332 pregnant women (gestational age:> 24 weeks) attending Liaquat University Hospital Hyderabad, Pakistan, were enrolled. Of these 112 were healthy normal pregnant women; 61 pregnant women had pre-eclampsia, 49 with eclampsia and 110 with placental abruption. A cohort of 30 patients with elevated hcy levels (> 8.2 \u00b5mol/liter), were given folate, vitamin B12 and B6 as supplements for 6 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected, centrifuged and stored at 2 to 8 C. Hcy levels were determined by IMx immunoassay. Results: Higher serum hcy levels, higher mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), pre-term deliveries and low foetal birth weights were noted in women with pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and eclampsia as compared to control and those with placental abruption. Significant hcy lowering effects of folate, vitamin B12 and B6 supplementation were observed. Significant and positive correlation was found between hhcy and MAP (r= 0.001; p< 0.001), albuminuria (r= 0.004; p< 0.01) and low birth weights (r= 0.05; p< 0.06).

Ninety-three adult patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) presenting to the urology outpatient clinic were evaluated for bladder outlet obstruction. Patients with urinary retention and neurological disorders were excluded. Evaluation was by clinical assessment, uroflowmetry, and ultrasound bladder for prevoid and postvoid urine volume estimation. The latter was compared with RF. Results were statistically analyzed using bivariate analysis and Spearman's test. In 93 evaluable patients, there were 87 (94%) males and 6 (6%) females. Residual volume ranged from 4 to 450 mL (mean 91.4+/-92.7 mL). Peak flow rate (Qmax) varied from 3 to 49 mL/s (mean 9+/-15 mLis). Two-tailed correlation between PVR and Qmax was significant at the. 05 level, whereas a more significant R value at. 01 was observed between RF and Qmax. There was a strong positive correlation between RF and PVR with Qmax. RF statistically correlated better with Qmax than PVR. It is recommended that RF be used instead of PVR in the routine noninvasive evaluation of LUTS.", "num_citations": "29\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Matching unfamiliar faces from poor quality closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage\n", "abstract": " Recent research on facial identification from closed-circuit television (CCTV) images reports the fallibility of matching unfamiliar faces from CCTV images to photographs, and suggests a mistrust of CCTV evidence in criminal court. In addition, the validity of expert analysis of CCTV footage for forensic facial identification has been frequently questioned. This research was designed to investigate whether training and experience in facial identification from CCTV footage would increase the ability to discriminate faces. It was concluded that when only very poor quality CCTV images are available, significant error rates in facial identification are likely; even when expert evidence is employed.Since the first closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras were installed at Bournemouth in 1986, it has been estimated that over four million CCTV cameras are operating currently in the UK (Norris and Armstrong 1999; Information Commissioner\u2019s Office 2006; BBC 2007). As CCTV security cameras have become an integral part of British Law enforcement, CCTV footage is frequently used in criminal court for the identification of offenders (Brown 1995; Welsh and Farrington 2002; Armitage 2002; Campbell-Tiech 2005; Costigan", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Interviewing witnesses: The cognitive interview\n", "abstract": " The cognitive interview (or CI) is one of the most exciting developments in psychology in the last ten years. The CI is a forensic tool that comprises a series of memory retrieval techniques designed to increase the amount of information that can be obtained from a witness and may help police officers and other profes-sionals obtain am ore complete and accurate report from a witness. The ability to obtain full and accurate information is critical in an investigation; a good interview with a key witness may determine the outcome of a criminal investigation. The cognitive interview (CI) was initially developed by the psychologists Ed Geiselman (University of California, Los Angeles) and Ron Fisher (Florida International University) in 1984 as a response to the many requests they re-ceived from police officers and legal professionals for a method of improving witness interviews. An empirical study of the techniques used by untrained police officers working in a police department in Miami, Florida (Fisher, Geiselman & Raymond, 1987), however, suggested that improving witness memory was only part of the story. There existed some fundamental problems in the conduct of\" standard\" police interviews that were leading to ineffective com-munication and limiting interviewer and witness performance. Fisher et al.(1987) document several characteristics of the \u201cstandard police interview\u201d among which were constant interruptions (when an eyewitness was giving an account), excessive use of question-answer format and inappropriate sequencing of questions.

The amount of information provided by UFM, along with ultrasonic estimation of residual urine in the bladder, usually is enough in the routine evaluation of elderly men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). A small subgroup, however, will require more detailed urodynamic testing. It also has made the decision concerning treatment of patients with stricture urethrae, managed by urethrotomy or dilatation, more objective. The role of UFM as an initial tool in the evaluation of all patients presenting with LUTS, irrespective of age and gender, is evolving. The addition of new parameters, performing UFM in the domiciliary setup, and the introduction of new software to facilitate interpretation will further enhance its ability in the evaluation of micturition disorders. The main limitation of UFM is its inability to discriminate between poor detrusor function and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), for which pressure flow studies are necessary.

One of its virulence factors is EspP, which belongs to the serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) family. In this review we recapitulate the current data on prevalence, biogenesis, structural properties and functionality. EspP has been used to investigate mechanistic details of autotransport, and recent studies indicate that this transport mechanism is not autonomous but rather dependent on additional factors. Currently, five subtypes have been identified (EspP\u03b1-EspP\u03b5), with EspP\u03b1 being associated with highly virulent EHEC serotypes and isolates from patients with severe disease. EspP\u03b1 has been shown to degrade major proteins of the complement cascade, namely C3 and C5 and probably interferes with hemostasis by cleavage of coagulation factor V. Furthermore, EspP\u03b1 is believed to contribute to biofilm formation perhaps by polymerization to rope-like structures. Together with the proteolytic activity, EspP\u03b1 might ameliorate host colonization and interfere with host response. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Alternating GUI test generation and execution\n", "abstract": " Users of today's software perform tasks by interacting with a graphical user interface (GUI) front-end via sequences of input events. Due to the flexibility offered by most GUIs, the number of event sequences grows exponentially with length. One ubiquitous challenge of GUI testing is to selectively generate those sequences that lead to potentially problematic states. This paper presents ALT, a new technique that generates GUI test cases in batches, by leveraging GUI run-time information from a previously run batch to obtain the next batch. Each successive batch consists of \"longer\" test cases that expand the state space to be explored, yet prune the \"unimportant\" states. The \"alternating\" nature of ALT allows it to enhance the next batch by leveraging certain relationships between GUI events (e.g., one enables the other, one alters the other's execution) that are revealed only at run-time and non-trivial to infer statically\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["302"]}
{"title": "Reliable effects screening: A distributed continuous quality assurance process for monitoring performance degradation in evolving software systems\n", "abstract": " Developers of highly configurable performance-intensive software systems often use in-house performance-oriented \"regression testing\" to ensure that their modifications do not adversely affect their software's performance across its large configuration space. Unfortunately, time and resource constraints can limit in-house testing to a relatively small number of possible configurations, followed by unreliable extrapolation from these results to the entire configuration space. As a result, many performance bottlenecks escape detection until systems are fielded. In our earlier work, we improved the situation outlined above by developing an initial quality assurance process called \"main effects screening\". This process 1) executes formally designed experiments to identify an appropriate subset of configurations on which to base the performance-oriented regression testing, 2) executes benchmarks on this subset whenever\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["302"]}
{"title": "Psychology's Two Cultures Revisited: Implications for the Integration of Science with Practice.\n", "abstract": " A national survey evaluated psychologists' opinions on professional and epistemological issues in clinical psychology. Clinical and nonclinical groups diverged markedly on two questions. The majority of clinical psychologists indicated that\" alternative ways of knowing, for which the scientific method is irrelevant,\" should be valued and supported, whereas few nonclinical psychologists agreed. Clinical psychologists were also more supportive of the value of\" intuitions based upon one's experiences during clinical practice\" than were nonclinical psychologists. Variability within the clinical group was large, however, and involvement in both clinical practice and research correlated with attitudes. The overlap between groups on most issues suggests optimism about the future of a unified field of psychology, but the data forecast continued conflict regarding epistemological issues.(PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Since 1984, the annual cardiovascular disease mortality rate has remained greater for women than men; however, over the last decade, there have been marked reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality in women. The dramatic decline in mortality rates for women is attributed partly to an increase in awareness, a greater focus on women and cardiovascular disease risk, and the increased application of evidence-based treatments for established coronary heart disease. This is the first scientific statement from the American Heart Association on acute myocardial infarction in women. Sex-specific differences exist in the presentation, pathophysiological mechanisms, and outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This statement provides a comprehensive review of the current evidence of the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, treatment, and outcomes of women with acute myocardial infarction.(Circulation. 2016; 133: 00-00.

The as-deposited thin films were characterized by powdered X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Thin films of CdS deposited at low temperature (350 C) consist of densely packed granular crystallites with an average size of ca. 150 nm, while at higher temperatures (400 and 450 C) particles with varying sizes and mixed morphologies are observed. The ZnS thin films deposited at 400 C showed rod-like structures, whereas dense globular-like structures were obtained at 450 C.

It was hypothesized that the two types of misinformation would result in omission and commission errors respectively. The results showed that the social influence resulted in an asymmetric effect (ie, more commission than omission errors).

{"title": "Grey-box gui testing: Efficient generation of event sequences\n", "abstract": " Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), due to their event driven nature, present a potentially unbounded space of all possible ways to interact with software. During testing it becomes necessary to effectively sample this space. In this paper we develop algorithms that sample the GUI's input space by only generating sequences that (1) are allowed by the GUI's structure, and (2) chain together only those events that have data dependencies between their event handlers. We create a new abstraction, called an event-dependency graph (EDG) of the GUI, that captures data dependencies between event handler code. We develop a mapping between EDGs and an existing black-box user-level model of the GUI's workflow, called an event-flow graph (EFG). We have implemented automated EDG construction in a tool that analyzes the bytecode of each event handler. We evaluate our \"grey-box\" approach using four open-source applications and compare it with the current state-of-the-art EFG approach. Our results show that using the EDG reduces the number of test cases while still achieving at least the same coverage. Furthermore, we were able to detect 2 new bugs in the subject applications.", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Input-oriented DEA model under constant return to scale (CRS) and variable return to scale (VRS) is employed. Four inputs (raw material, staff expenses, plant & machinery and cost of goods sold) and two outputs (net sales and earnings after tax) are employed to analyze technical, pure technical and scale efficiency scores. The results on individual company indicate that 16 percent of the companies are consistently operating at the most productive scale size (MPSS) throughout the study period on both efficiency parameters (CRS and VRS). 20 percent of the companies have operated at the MPSS, at least one out of three years.

We herein report two cases of GCTs, one benign and one malignant, presenting with gross hematuria in a 14- and a 47-year-old female, respectively. Histopathology revealed characteristic GCTs with positive immunostaining for neural marker (S-100) and negative immunostaining for epithelial (cytokeratin, Cam 5.2, AE/A13), neuroendocrine (neuron specific enolase, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin) and sarcoma (desmin, vimentin) markers. The benign tumor was successfully managed conservatively with transurethral resection alone while for the malignant tumor, radical cystectomy, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, anterior vaginectomy, plus lymph node dissection was done. Both cases show long-term disease free survival.

{"title": "Distributed Continuous Quality Assurance Process for Evaluating QoS of Performance-Intensive Software.\n", "abstract": " Performance-intensive software is increasingly being used on heterogeneous combinations of OS, compiler, and hardware platforms. Examples include reusable middleware that forms the basis for scientific computing grids and distributed real-time and embedded systems. Since this software has stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements, it often provides a multitude of configuration options that can be tuned for specific application workloads and run-time environments. As performance-intensive systems evolve, developers typically conduct quality assurance (QA) tasks in-house, on a small number of configurations to identify and alleviate overhead that degrades performance. QA performed solely in-house is inadequate because of time/resource constraints, and insufficient to manage software variability, ie, ensuring software quality on all supported target platforms across all desired configuration options. This paper addresses limitations with in-house QA for performance-intensive software by applying the Skoll distributed continuous quality assurance (DCQA) processes, to improve software performance iteratively, opportunistically, and efficiently around-the-clock in multiple, geographically distributed locations. It describes model driven tools that allow Skoll users to capture the system\u2019s axes of variability (such as configuration options, QoS strategies, and platform dependencies). It describes experiments that apply Skoll to evaluate and improve the performance of DRE component middleware on a range of platforms and configuration options. The results show that automatic analysis of QA task results can significantly improve software\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["302"]}

We present ASPIRE: automated systematic protocol implementation robustness evaluation, an automated approach to pro-actively test protocol implementations by observing their responses to faulty protocol data units (PDUs) or messages. In contrast to existing approaches, we sample the faulty PDU space in a systematic manner, thus allowing us to evaluate protocol implementations in the face of a wider variety of faulty PDUs. We use a pruning strategy to reduce, from exponential, the size of the faulty PDU set to polynomial in the number of fields of a PDU.

The results demonstrated that DNH-49 significantly opened its first flower (44 DAP) earlier than other strains hence was observed as early maturing variety followed by CRIS-82 (45 DAP). CIM-482 opened its first flower after 48 days of planting and was observed as late, followed by FH-900 (47 DAP). As regards the second character (node number of first sympodial branch), the same trend of earliness was observed as in days taken to open first flower. Accordingly, DNH-49 produced significantly lowest main stem node number of first sympodial branch (7.1) and was recorded as early followed by CRIS-82 (7.2) and NIAB-999 (7.3). CIM-482 and FH-900 were observed as late strains in the test which produced significantly highest main stem node number of first sympodial branch (8.6) followed by BH-121 (8.5).

Because sizes of these test suites can be extremely large, researchers have developed techniques, such as reduction and minimization, to obtain test suites that are ldquosimilarrdquo to the original test suite, but smaller. Existing similarity metrics mostly use code coverage; they do not consider the contextual relationships between events. Consequently, reduction based on such metrics may eliminate desirable test cases. In this paper, we present a new parameterized metric, CONTeSSi(n) which uses the context of n preceding events in test cases to develop a new context-aware notion of test suite similarity for EDS.

Study was made on the estimates of general and specific combining ability of the parents and also genetic components of variances for seed cotton yield, lint%, staple length and uniformity ratio. The per se hybrid performance generally revealed that parents Karishma and CRIS-134 formed the best hybrids for yield, lint% and uniformity ratio. It is also assumed that parents that perform well in per se hybrids will also perform similar for specific combining ability (sca) but this prediction did not hold true without few exceptions. The discrepancy between per se hybrid and sca value is not a good indicator to predict parental performance in hybrid combinations. However, hybrids perse result generally connoted that parents Karishma and CRIS-134 form good combinations with other parents for hybrid crop production. Specific combining ability estimates further indicated that hybrids NH-26 x CRIS-78 for yield, CRIS-134 x NH-26 for lint%, NH-26 x CRIS-122 for staple length and CRIS-134 x NH-26 for uniformity ratio are greatly preferred.

Currently, some contemporary non-testable programs are represented by systems with complex outputs such as GUIs (Graphical User Interface), Web applications, and Text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge associated with automated test oracles and SUTs with complex outputs. Extensible testing frameworks are necessary to provide the reuse of components and the sharing of knowledge in this field. This paper presents an extensible framework to support the development of test oracles for non-testable programs with complex outputs. In addition, we present an alternative to reuse software engineering components through plug-ins-based frameworks. The framework adapts CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval) concepts to enable testers to specify test oracles. The framework matches concepts of signal feature extraction, similarity functions, and object comparisons to obtain a Java program that compares two objects, responding how similar they are, according to a threshold. We performed proofs of concept using two empirical studies and the results showed our framework is useful to alleviate human-oracle efforts supporting human decisions. In addition, the plug-insbased framework we present is a contribution toward a reusing of components on test oracles for systems with complex outputs.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Treatment of CCl 4 1 ml/kg bw (25% CCl 4/olive oil ip) once a week for 16 weeks significantly decreased the activities of catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase in the thyroid. Level of reduced glutathione was decreased, while lipid peroxidation (TBARS) was significantly increased with CCl 4 in the thyroid of rat. CCl 4 significantly enhanced the level of thyroidal DNA injuries and AgNORs count. Serum level of TT 3 and TT 4 was significantly decreased, while TSH level was increased with CCl 4 treatment. Pleiomorphic histopathological abnormalities in thyroid were caused by CCl 4 treatment. Co-treatment of DME (100 and 200 mg/kg bw) intragastrically once a week for 16 weeks suppressed the toxic effects of CCl 4 and level of thyroid hormones, the activities of oxidative enzymes, glutathione (GSH) and TBARS concentration. Histopathological injuries induced with CCl 4 were remarkably reduced with co-treatment of DME in a dose dependent fashion.

There was no TUR-syndrome in our patients, and serum levels of all parameters did not change significantly after TURP with water. Patients with a drop in sodium post-TURP did not have significant changes in Crea, BUN or fHb. The average saving was 162.60 USD per treatment. In our study population, water was a safe irrigation solution. Even with some degree of resorption, there were no significant haemolysis or metabolic imbalances.

Subjects were chosen using convenience sampling. The physicians were picked from six hospitals of Karachi.Results: When the smoking physicians were asked what could motivate them to stop smoking, majority of them said that an occurrence of a smoking related illness would. Majority of the physicians who do not smoke felt that individual will was the greatest force keeping them from smoking. When asked how smoking can be reduced in Pakistan, majority of the physicians, both smoking and non-smoking, favoured mass health education. Lay smokers expressed marked ignorance about deleterious effects of cigarette smoke. Like smoking physicians, majority of them said that occurrence of an illness related to smoking would effectively motivate them to stop smoking.CONCLUSION: Based on this survey we conclude that mass health education and enforcement of the ban on smoking in public places will effectively reduce the number of smokers.

{"title": "Extending manual gui testing beyond defects by building mental models of software behavior\n", "abstract": " Manual GUI testing involves providing inputs to the software via its GUI and determining the software's correctness using its outputs, one of them being the GUI itself. Because of its human-in-the-loop nature, GUI testing is known to be a time-consuming activity. In practice, it is done by junior, inexpensive testers to keep costs low at the very tail-end of the software development process. In this paper, we posit that the importance of GUI testing has suffered due to its traditional narrow role -- to detect residual software defects. Because of its human-in-the-loop nature, GUI testing has the potential to provide outputs other than defects and to be used as inputs to several downstream activities, e.g., security analysis. One such output is the mental model that the GUI tester creates during testing, a model that implicitly informs the tester of the software designer's intent.

After informed consent was taken and confidentiality ensured, respondents answered an anonymous questionnaire of closed-ended questions regarding hepatitis. The interview was followed by an educational intervention session. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 17.Results: About 51% and 32% of the barbers and clients respectively had knowledge regarding hepatitis. Razors were recognized as agents for transmitting the infection by 12% and 42% of the barbers and clients respectively. Most (96%) barbers disinfected the razor before use and 49% of the clients confirmed that the razor was sterilized before shaving, while 79% insisted on new blade. Though 50% and 30% of the barbers and clients respectively knew that hepatitis is a preventable disease, only 2% and 7% of the respective barbers and clients were vaccinated against Hepatitis B. Reasons for not being vaccinated were non-awareness and cost of the HBV vaccine. Only half of the barbers and clients considered themselves to be at risk for hepatitis.Conclusions: In Karachi, barbers and clients have poor knowledge of hepatitis and the means of transmissions, as well as low vaccination rates against HBV infection.

In this paper, we leverage methods and measures from network analysis to analyze and study GUIs, with the goal of aiding GUI testing activities. We apply these methods and measures on the event-flow graph model of GUIs. Results of a case study show that \"network centrality measures\" are able to identify the most important events in the GUI as well as the most important sequences of events. These events and sequences are good candidates for test prioritization.

Patients belonged to both sexes having cholelithiasis, diagnosed on the basis of clinical grounds and supported by ultrasonography. A uniform procedure of history taking, physical examination, investigations and treatment was adopted for all the patients, and data were recorded on the pre-designed proforma.RESULTS: Of 200 cases that were operated for gall bladder stone disease, eight were found to have carcinoma of gall bladder ie frequency was 4%. The age ranged from 35 to 70 years, with mean 50 (+ 5.3) in females and 56 (+ 2) in males. Male to female ratio was 1: 3. On ultrasound, only three (37.50%) patients with advanced disease had a pre-operative clue of carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The frequency of gall bladder carcinoma in our population seems much higher than Western populations. Females are more affected than males by this problem.

{"title": "Bioethanol production from waste potatoes as a sustainable waste-to-energy resource via enzymatic hydrolysis\n", "abstract": " Ever increasing demand of energy and corresponding looming depletion of fossil fuels have transpired into a burning need of time to vie for alternative energy resources before the traditional energy sources are completely exhausted. Scientists are continuously working on sustainable energy production as an alternate source of energy to meet the present and future requirements. This research deals with conversion of the starch to fermentable carbon source (sugars) by fermentation through liquefaction by using yeast and alpha- amylase. The results show that the significant bioethanol production was achieved while using the parameters like temperature (30 \u00b0C) pH (6) and incubation time of 84 hrs. About 90 ml of bioethanol was produced from potato intake of 800 g.

Surplus production model computer software packages of CEDA (catch effort data analysis) and ASPIC (a surplus production model incorporating covariates) had been used. The surplus production models of Fox, Schaefer and Pell-Tomlinson with three error assumptions (normal, log-normal and gamma) were applied in this study. In CEDA when initial proportion (IP)= 1 was used (because the initial catch was roughly 100% of the maximum catch) the obtained MSY results in Fox model with normal, log-normal and gamma error assumptions, were 4379mt, 4403 and 4439mt respectively. While the Schaefer and Pella Tomlinson models produced same results as 4336mt, 4497mt and 4415mt. The estimated coefficient values of Fox model ranged from 0.100 to 0.121, which were low as compared to Schaefer and Pella Tomlinson models. The Estimated R2 values from three surplus models were close to 0.9, which showed better fit to the models. From the ASPIC point of view, the obtained results with CV were 4549mt (0.155) and 4674mt (0.113). Because the catch in 2009 (5951mt) were higher than MSY estimates, therefore we suggest that the stocks of Cephalopods in Pakistani waters have been over exploited.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["302"]}

But the population of faults that such a sample would represent depends heavily on the faults' context or environment---as does the cost of failing to detect those faults. If empirical studies are to provide information that a practitioner can apply outside the context of the study, they must characterize the faults studied in a way that translates across contexts.

Detecting page-to-environment incompliance and modifying pages to promote universal accessibility is one important step in improving the process of exploration and navigation in the web user experience. To address this issue, we have designed a system that evaluates the accessibility of a web page in a given browsing environment based on knowledge of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) tags that comprise the page and knowledge of the tag support provided in respective browsing environments. Given this approach, one of the most important aspects of the system is the comprehensive nature of tag support knowledge. The more support rules known, the more environment-specific bugs the system can accurately identify. In order to optimize knowledge of tag support criteria, we have also incorporated a learning mechanism that can inductively determine HTML tags that are unsupported in a given environment by observing both positive and negative examples of web page appearance and behavior.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Most commonly occurring viral hepatitis is hepatitis C, closely followed by hepatitis B and in males both are common, with hepatitis B seen earlier than hepatitis C.Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on 585 adolescent college boys. Respondents were interviewed after informed consent and ensuring confidentiality. An anonymous questionnaire of close ended questions was completed followed by an educational intervention session. Results: Knowledge regarding types of viral hepatitis was known to 11% urban and 22% rural respondents, while 75% from Karachi and 84% from interior Sindh had awareness that hepatitis B and C are infectious diseases. About 58% urban respondents knew that hepatitis B can develop cirrhosis and lead to liver cancer as compared to 73% rural inhabitants. Knowledge regarding spread of hepatitis B and C by transfusing infected blood or blood products or injury by infected sharp or tattooing/body piercing was known to 43.5% from Karachi and 40% from interior Sindh. About 45% urban and 19% rural respondents were vaccinated for hepatitis B and reasons for not being vaccinated were non awareness and cost of vaccine.

Each video contained unique items that were thus seen only by one witness. Dyads in one condition were encouraged to discuss the event before each witness (individually) performed a recall test, while in a control condition dyads were not allowed to discuss the event prior to recall. A significant proportion (71%) of witnesses who had discussed the event went on to mistakenly recall items acquired during the discussion. There were no age-related differences in susceptibility to these memory conformity effects in younger (18\u201330 years) as compared to older (60\u201380 years) participants.

It stands at the 5 th position in its sacreage and production and almost 15 th position in sugar production in the world. Sugarcane is mainly grown for manufacturing sugar and other sweeteners (Shakar and Gur) and its by-products are used as fodder, in chipboard and paper industries. It is an important source of household income and employment for the farming community also in its comparatively advantageous areas. The share of sugarcane in total agricultural value added and GDP are 4.5 and 0.9 percent, respectively (Government of Pakistan, 2008). Although both the sugarcane area and production were increased in past two decades, but in a cyclical fashion (Government of Pakistan, 2007). In sugarcane growing areas, about 64 percent of total area under this crop has been planted by farm sizes ranging from 1 to 10 hectares (Agricultural Census of Pakistan, 2000). Currently, there are 77 sugar mills in the country with a distribution of 41 mills in Punjab, 29 mills in Sindh and 7 mills in NWFP province. These mills crushed nearly 74 percent of total sugarcane produced in the country to produce 3.52 million tonnes of white sugar (Government of Pakistan, 2007).The sugar industry is the second largest industry in Pakistan accounting for 8% of total value added in large scale manufacturing industries. In 1999, the sugar industry had an estimated capacity to produce 5 million metric tons (MMT) of sugar per annum, with consumption hovering around 3.15 MMT, which created an exportable surplus of 1.85 MMT.

{"title": "Interviewing suspects of crime\n", "abstract": " In order to solve criminal investigations it is essential that police officers gather as much information and evidence as possible so that they can determine how and why the crime occurred, and who committed the crime. One of the most valuable tools used by police officers when gathering evidence in criminal investigations is the investigative interview. This is particularly so when other forms of evidence against a suspect are weak or non-existent. The amount of research conducted into the quality of investigative interviews in Britain has been substantial. Importantly, this research has resulted in the production of guidelines regarding investigative interviewing, training for investigators as well as influencing legal policies in Britain (eg Clarke & Milne, 2001; Home Office, 1985, 2001; Home Office, Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, 1999; Scottish Executive, 2003).With regards to the investigative interviewing of suspects, the techniques used during the interview phase of an investigation have changed markedly over the last century.

A total of 240 broilers, equally divided in four groups A, B, C and D (n= 60 chicks in each group) and fed on diet with 3.5%, 4.5%, 5.5% and 6.5% of fat, respectively. The completely randomized block design was used to perform this experiment from day first to 6 week. The results revealed that average feed intake of broiler in groups A, B, C and D was 4527.80, 4378.87, 4335.88 and 4298.76 g/b; average water intake about 17.63, 17.10, 18.38 and 19.39 liter/b; live body weight-1926.81, 2182.26, 2228.86 2267.94 g/b; FCR-2.32, 1.99, 1.94 and 1.89; carcass weight-1117.45, 1318.82, 1354.81 and 1387.83 g/b; dressing percentage-58.17, 60.53, 61.21 and 61.29, respectively. The blood cholesterol level was 49.85, 104.45, 81.60 and 95.12 mg/dL; the fat% in muscles was 5.69, 6.09, 7.32 and 7.83% respectively. The increasing level of fat, the feed consumption was decreased, but water intake was increased and broiler gained more weight as compared to lower dietary fat levels. The FCR improved simultaneously with increasing dietary fat levels (P< 0.002). The carcass weight and subsequent dressing percentage increased with increasing fat level, but differences were non-significant (P> 0.05) when fat level used beyond 4.5%. The weight of internal edible and non-edible organs increased with increasing dietary fat levels. It was demonstrated that ration containing 6.5% fat fed to broiler for better growth performance and production.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Significant differences were observed among parents, hybrids and hybrids versus parents for most of the agronomic, yield and quality characters of hybrids in both environments. Genotype x environment interaction was also significant in most of the traits studied. Results based on combining ability tests showed that, gene action for yield and agronomic traits was dominant while gene action for quality traits was additive. Results reveal that specific combining ability (SCA) variances were higher than the general combining ability (GCA) variances under lowland and upland environments for all the characters studied, except number of productive tillers per plant, number of non-productive tillers per plant, length of panicle, percent filled grains per panicle and grain breadth. These data suggest that non-additive gene action is important. Estimates of GCA effects under both environments of this study revealed that lines Sugdasi, Bengalo and DR65 were the best general combiners for grain yield and tester, Pandan was the best potential source of desirable genes for yield and yield related traits.

{"title": "The behaviour of witnesses viewing VIPER Parades: evidence from a Scottish survey.\n", "abstract": " At the beginning of the year, a questionnaire for Video Identification Procedure Electronic Recording (VIPER) operators was distributed to all the Scottish Police Forces. This is the first archival analysis to be undertaken on VIPER parades and the results from the survey will provide officers with valuable information on the usefulness of VIPER for obtaining evidence from witnesses. The survey is nearly half way through and over one thousand completed questionnaires have been collected so far. The questionnaire focused on the demographics of the witnesses, suspects and also the behaviour of the witnesses\u2019 whilst viewing VIPER parades. The questionnaires obtained so far have revealed that half of witnesses were male and the majority were under the age of 35, with over a third being vulnerable witnesses. When it came to suspects, the majority were male and also under the age of 35. The crimes that appeared to be the most common for suspects in the VIPER parades were crimes of violence. When viewing the VIPER lineups the majority of witnesses made a positive identification, that is picking out the suspect. In the analysis of witnesses behaviour whilst viewing the parade, the majority of witnesses appeared calm before viewing the parade, during the viewing and afterwards. The results obtained so far appear to show that the VIPER parades are a good medium for allowing witnesses to identify a suspect without the emotional stress of facing an accused in a live setting.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Factors influencing witness evidence\n", "abstract": " Justice often depends on the reliability of eyewitness testimony. Criminals are released because eyewitnesses fail to identify them. Innocent people are convicted on the basis of errant eyewitness testimony. In the USA, the FBI has carried out DNA testing on people convicted of rape and other crimes which leave biological evidence (Connors et al., 1996). Wells et al.(1998) describe 40 of these cases, in which the most prominent evidence that convicted the person was eyewitness identification, often by the victim. The DNA tests showed that none of these\" criminals\" was in fact the culprit, and all were (eventually) released. Huff, Rattner and Sagarin (1996) estimate that there are approximately 10000 false convictions in the USA each year. Agreeing with Brandon and Davies'(1973) findings from the UK, Huff and colleagues believe that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of false convictions.

Current techniques rely on hand-curated static subsets of checks to be run at different stages of the data production pipeline, These hard-coded subsets are uninformed of data changes, and cause bug detection to be delayed to downstream quality assurance activities. To address these problems, we have developed new representations of map data changes and checks, formally defined \"check safety,\" and built a recommender system that dynamically and automatically selects and ranks a relevant subset of checks using signals from latest data changes.

The special tools were used using catch and effort data analysis (CEDA) and a stoc production model incorporating covariates (ASPIC) for estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Three surplus production models of Fox, Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson with three error assumptions, usually gamma, normal and log normal are used in CEDA. The Fox model calculated these MSY for normal, lognormal and gamma error hypotheses as 2592 tons (CV= 0. 154, R2= 0. 593), 2806 tons (CV= 0. 104, R2= 0. 620) and 2673 tons (CV= 0. 134, R2= 0. 608) respectively at the initial proportion (IP) of 0.7. The estimated MSY using normal and lognormal error assumptions for the Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson models were 2887 tons (CV= 0. 178, R2= 0. 579) and 3248 tons (CV= 0. 072, R2= 0. 606). Whereas, the gamma error resulted minimization failure of both models here. The calculated parameters of the Fox model in ASPIC by way of MSY, CV, R2, FMSY and BMSY were 2578 tons, 0.108, 0.743, 0.132 and 19520 tons, and corresponds to the values 2477 tons, 0.142, 0.738, 0.101 and 24550 tons per year calculated by the logistic model. Present estimated MSY values are lower than annual catch is shows that the stoc of this fish is in overexploitation state.

Depletion of natural resources and environmental issues like climate change have forced global energy strategists to focus on sustainable energy practices. Based on data collected during this review process, it is evidently concluded that RE cannot be considered a reliable source yet as suggested by 93% of the reviewed studies. The identified solutions are forecasting and storage system (43%); smart grids with curtailment, peak shaving and power smoothing for grid stability (43%); and hybrid RE grids with extensive transmission and distribution. Also, grid related solutions are suggested by 31% of studies, which are grid integrated storage options and interconnected micro girds for power regulation and management. Storage enhancement techniques like battery storage and electric vehicle based domestic storage for power compensation during low power generation and for back-up purposes is proposed by 25% of reviewed articles. Lastly, algorithm integrated forecasting system for smart management and resource distribution are supported by 18% of analyzed studies. Implementation of these solutions can improve the chances of achieving a 100% renewable national grid without a conventional energy backup within next few years.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["302"]}

At present, structural integrity and wing performance are mostly evaluated on the basis of static loading only. While dynamic loading has got minor attention due to this research work analyses structural and aerodynamic behavior of rectangular aircraft wing under time varying conditions. The effects of structural non-linearity were also taken into account. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) codes were coupled to predict aerodynamic performance of deformable wing structure. To analyze and compare the performance of rigid and flexible Aluminum alloy 7075 T6 wing were simulated. Research results reveal that there is 5.64% decrease in Lift-to-Drag ratio by considering wing as flexible structure. The analysis of wing structural behavior by varying fluid forces showed that wing behavior is highly non-linear in nature; therefore dynamic loading conditions are highly important to consider.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "The role of cretaceous rifts on the occurrence of oil in Sindh, Monocline, Pakistan\n", "abstract": " The occurrence of oil and gas in Sindh Monocline seems to be due to the extensional tectonics. The main Cretaceous rifting episodes divided the Monocline into horst and grabens. The oil formations in the grabens were buried deep and were subjected to high temperatures, resulting in cracking and maturation of hydrocarbons into condensate and dry gas, where as the oil formations in the horst show their burial to relatively shallow depth and lower temperatures, thus they were able to retain the oil. The present depths of the producing formation suggest that faulting in the Monocline was continuous, and even the condensate and gas bearing reservoir rock was uplifted, but this did not affect the hydrocarbons due to irreversibility of the process of cracking and maturation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["302"]}

It was found that the Ag-containing compound exhibited superconductivity with a T c of 78 K while the Pb-containing compound exhibited a T c of 87 K. The ultrasonic attenuation was measured at frequencies of 5, 10, 20 and 30 MHz in the temperature range 77 to 300 K. Five relaxation peaks were observed in Bi 0.8 Pb 0.2 SrCaCu 1.5 O y and Bi 0.8 Ag 0.2 SrCaCu 1.5 O y compounds. As the frequency of the measurement is increased, the temperature of the peaks shifts to higher values while the height of the peaks decreases. The first three peaks (P 1, P 2 and P 3) may be attributed to the electronic defects (hopping of holes) and the other two could be ascribed to the thermally activated movement of boundaries by interaction with the defects.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["302"]}

This makes a solid case for adoption in many developed as well as developing countries. However, there are many countries who have not successfully implemented it due to lack of facilities and even lack of awareness of customers. Even in a developing country like Pakistan E-Payment system is not so popular because of many operational constraints, according to Asian Development Bank (ADB) almost 95% people of Pakistan rely on case on delivery (COD) method and only 5% people use E-Payment system. In Hyderabad many people prefer COD method when they order online. This research aimed to analyze the customer awareness and lack of adoption of E-payment system in Hyderabad marketplace. The survey was conducted using questionnaire that was adopted from existing measurement instruments from past research papers. The questionnaires were distributed to customers and banks of Hyderabad, male and female, aged ranging from 18 to 51 years old. The data is analyzed using SPSS Software. The sample size was 350 respondents of Hyderabad. This study found that system credibility, facilitating conditions, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are the most important factors that affect to the customer awareness and slow adoption of E-payment system.

Hyderabad Electric Supply Company is suffering from distribution losses of around 25%, which are far above the accepted level. Segregation of power losses due to different reasons help in developing a priority based remedial programs that will enhance overall efficiency of the company and improve revenue generation. In this research work, one of the 11kV distribution feeder is analyzed for power loss segregation. Collected data shows 27% of total losses for the month of August 2018. Collected data is used for modelling and simulation of selected feeder using PSS SINCAL software. Simulation analysis of existing system gives 10.59% technical losses indicating 16.41% of theft. Effect of improper conductor size and jumpers, poor power factor and unbalanced loading are considered as major contributor to technical power losses. Maximum power loss reduction on feeder is possible with balancing of loads on LT circuits of transformers. On the other hand power factor improvement through installation of capacitors on HT side also reduce sufficient power losses on the feeder. Hence small efforts can improve system efficiency without much investment.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["302"]}

The maximum, minimum and average catch of this fishery resource remained 14824 t (1984), 5004 t (2006) and 7925 t y-1, correspondingly. Data was analyzed by using two specialized fishery software i.e. CEDA and ASPIC. Three surplus production models (SPMs) viz. Fox (FM), Schaefer (SM) and Pella-Tomlinson (PTM) were used in CEDA. Furthermore, error assumptions (EAs) viz. normal (NEA), log normal (LNEA) and gamma (GEA), for each SPM were also applied in CEDA. Two SPMs, FM and LM, were used in ASPIC. In CEDA by using an initial proportion (IP) of 1, FM estimated MSY, CV and R2 as 6474 t (tons), 0.048 and 0.670 for NEA. While, the computed values of these parameters for LNEA remained as 6108 t, 0.061 and 0.574, correspondingly. For this model, GEA produced minimization failure (MF). Estimated MSY for all EAs by SM and PTM were remained same viz. 7731 t, 6959 t and 7102 t, correspondingly. FM results showed the highest value of R2 (0.670). In ASPIC, FM estimated MSY, FMSY, CV and R2 as 6200 t, 0.219 y-1, 0.054 and 0.896, respectively, whereas, LM computed same parameters as 6769 t, 0.207 y-1, 0.100 and 0.846, correspondingly.

{"title": "Application of non-equilibrium models to evaluate fishery status of squids in Pakistani Marine Waters\n", "abstract": " Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of squid fishery (including all species of squids) from Pakistani marine waters was calculated by using the catch and effort data from 1998 to 2010. Reported squid capture production totaled 40,390 metric tons (mt) during this period. The highest catch was 5,062 mt in 1999 while the lowest catch, 2,130 mt, was observed in 2003. Two specialized computer applications viz. CEDA and ASPIC were employed to statically evaluate the data. CEDA computer package includes three surplus production models (SPMs): the Fox, Schaefer and Pella Tomlinson models. Each model further uses three error assumptions ie log, log normal and gamma. An IP (initial proportion) of 0.6 was used because the initial catch was about 60% of the maximum catch. Computed MSY and CV values from the Fox model with log and log normal error assumptions were 2,401 mt (0.314) and 2,553 mt (0.250) correspondingly. However, for the Schaefer and Pella Tomlinson models, by using log and log normal assumptions, MSY and CV values remained 2,416 mt (0.235), 2,746 mt (0.072) and 2,416 mt (0.292) and 2,746 mt (0.063) in that order. All the SPMs with gamma error assumption did not produced interpretable result. In ASPIC, we used two models ie Fox and Logistic. Computed MSY with CV remained 2,659 mt (0.093) and 2,664 mt (0.065) respectively. CEDA computer package showed better fit to the data in terms of goodness of fit (R2) values.

The sample consisted of n= 133 pairs of length and weight data. The length ranged from 46 to 113 cm TL (65.661\u00b115.995 cm), while the weight varied from 500 to 7500 g TW (1806.391\u00b11481.456 g). Length-weight relationship was calculated as a= 0.04, b= 3.047 (R2= 0.99). The von Bertalanffy growth function parameters for S. seenghala were L\u221e= 117.60 (TL cm) and K= 0.370 year-1, while the age at zero length was t0= -0.513 year. The total instantaneous mortality rate (Z) was estimated at 95% CI of 0.77-1.22 (Z= 1.00 year-1) in the Indus River. The natural mortality (M) was computed as M= 0.556 year-1 at an average annual temperature of surface water of 21oC, whereas the fishing mortality was estimated as F= 0.444 year-1. Therefore, exploitation ratio (E= F/Z) was calculated as E= 0.444. The growth performances indices for L\u221e and W\u221e  were computed \u03a6'= 3.709 and \u03a6= 2.175 respectively.

Thus the current fishing mortality rate was smaller than Fopt= 0.556 year-1, Fmax= 0.85 year-1  and F0.1= 0.75 year-1. Therefore, we can assume that the current stock of this important fishery resource is not over-fished.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Analysis of financial viability of long term investment in guava orchards in Sindh province of Pakistan\n", "abstract": " A study was conducted at Technology Transfer Institute of PARC, Tandojam, Pakistan during 2006. The objective was to assess financial viability in establishing guava (Psidium guajava) orchards in Sindh province. Combinations of analytical techniques were used for this purpose. The results revealed that guava production starts from third year after planting of tree and it reaches a maximum level during 12th year and remains constant up to 25th years. Return on investment (IRR) in guava orchards was determined as 26 percent against current rate of interest on agricultural loans. The pay-back period of guava orchards starts from three years. The data further indicate that 40 years is the optimum economic life of guava orchards, after that there is a declining trend of guava production. According to sensitivity analysis it was found that guava outcomes are more sensitive to variation in prices than cost of production. Hence, there is a need to put more emphasis on stabilization of guava prices by improving existing marketing system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "A Model-based Distributed Continuous Quality Assurance Process to Enhance the Quality of Service of Evolving Performance-intensive Software Systems\n", "abstract": " Time and resource constraints often force developers of highly configurable systems, such as that found in performance-intensive software, to assess their system's performance on very few configurations and to extrapolate from these to the entire configuration space, which allows many performance bottlenecks and sources of QoS degradation to escape detection until systems are fielded. To improve the assessment of performance across large configuration spaces, we present a model-based approach to developing and deploying a new distributed continuous quality assurance (DCQA) process. Our approach builds upon and extends the Skoll environment, which is developing and validating novel software QA processes and tools that leverage the extensive computing resources of worldwide user communities in a distributed, continuous manner to significantly and rapidly improve software quality.

The FMCG products are surveyed. As the demand of these products are increasing day by day. With the rapid increase of FMCG sector, Pakistan Being an Islamic country Muslims are at ease as they believe that whatever the product that is available in market is halal. Not give a second thought of country of origin. The research is performed on a survey based study to investigate the FMCG products. In that product are categorized into two categories that are food and non-food products. The survey is conducted in Hyderabad of different super markets that include Dawood super mart, Max bachat, The Grocers, Baig mart, Hamid super store and many other. In this research Food Products that are surveyed includes beverages, Dairy Products, baked Products and snacks. And Non-food products that are surveyed include Cosmetics, Toiletries, Cleaning Product and Fragrance products. Present study found that there is very less products in market are halal certified. It is an alarming time for Pakistan as it is an Islamic country there is no halal certification body that can certify the products. In food category 62 products of Beverages were surveyed out of which only 24% are halal certified, 37 dairy Products were surveyed out of which only 24.3% are halal certified, 30 snack food were surveyed out of which only 30% are halal certified and 84 baked products were surveyed out of which only 50% are halal certified.

The average landing of dolphinfish fishery was 2418.55 t. The highest catch was 4053t in the year 2002 and the lowest catch was 1297t in the year 1990. The CEDA (Catch and Effort Data Analysis) computer software package was used for the MSY estimation of dolphinfish fishery in Pakistan. In this study we used the initial proportion (IP) value of 0.3 because the starting catch was approximately 30% of the maximum catch. The estimated values of MSY from Fox model with two error assumptions normal and log-normal were 2792.125 t (R2= 0.454) and 2920.592 t (R2= 0.565) respectively. The MSY values from Schaefer and Pella Tomlinson models with two error assumptions normal and log-normal were 2781.02 t (R2= 0.474) and 2863.3 t (R2= 0.572) respectively. The values of Schaefer and Pella Tomlinson were the same. The gamma error assumption showed minimization failures for all three models. We may say the estimated MSY were lower than the current catch, therefore we suggest reducing the fishing effort for dolphinfish fishery.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Thirty adult normal cycling Kamori goats were selected and divided in to three equal (N-10) treatment groups and synchronized with different estrus synchronization protocols. Goats in group A were given progesterone on day 0 and PGF2? with GnRH on day 10 th, goats in group B were given PGF2? on day-0 and repeat dose of PGF2? with GnRH on day 10 th, whereas goats in group C served as control. All the goats were observed for estrus induction. Goats showing estrus were allowed for breeding, natural breeding was practiced using an intact breeding bucks. The blood samples were collected after day 21 st of post-breeding to measure progesterone concentration level with ELISA Reader (Beck-Man Coulter Inc. AD-430) using Progesterone kit (Accu-Bind\u00ae, Monobind Inc. USA). The mean (\u00b1SEM) progesterone concentration level was recorded as 2.42\u00b11.37, 2.57\u00b11.21, 2.71\u00b11.06 in group A, B, and C, respectively in pregnant and 1.27\u00b10.98 ng/ml in non-pregnant goats. No significant difference (P> 0.05) was found among the goat groups A, B and C. Increased progesterone concentration level (post-breeding) in goats was found to be one of the best indicators of pregnancy. This study suggests that the ELISA kit method could be used for early pregnancy determination in Kamori goats.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

This research was planned to assess the efficiency of different estrus synchronization procedures with bull exposed and with non-bull exposed groups in primiparous and multiparous buffaloes at Kundhi buffalo farm Rorhi and its surroundings. Total 40 (n= 20 primiparous, n= 20 multiparous) buffaloes were used in this study. The chosen buffaloes were divided into two main groups, A (BE, Bull-Exposed) and group B (NE, Non-Exposed). Based on the treatments A group was further sub-divided into two sub-groups, OvSynch bull-exposed (OBE) A1 and prostaglandin bull exposed (PBE) A2. Also, B group was parted into dual sub-groups Ovsynch non-exposed (ONE) and prostaglandin non-exposed (PNE) group B2. Results of the present study showed that estrus response differed significantly among the primiparous and multiparous Kundhi buffalo in all groups (P< 0.05). The overall estrus response (50% and 100%) and pregnancy rates (40% and 70%) were higher in both primiparous and multiparous animals of BE groups as compared to primiparous (60% and 70%), and multiparous animals (30% and 60%) of NE groups.

A total of 1099 cases,(377 females, 722 males) were reported. Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) was discovered in 93.7% cases compared to 6.3% Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum). Based on the highest and lowest weather temperatures, in summer (June, July and August) and in winter (December, January and February) were differentiated. The number of cases were greater during summer months compared to winter. Interestingly, the ratio of P. falciparum to P. vivax during winter was greater compared to summer. Finally, there was a strong correlation between increasing humidity and number of malaria cases. These findings show that even though the incidence of malaria is higher in summer, malaria cases are still reported in winter. Furthermore, the probability of finding P. falciparum (which causes cerebral malaria) is higher in winter.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Obtained results show that this fishery resource is overexploited. CEDA software computed MSY in a range between 4,600-4,900 t (tons). On the other hand, ASPIC range for MSY estimation remained between 4,800-5,200 t for this fishery resource. It is vivid that MSY range computed by both the computer packages overlap each other. CEDA showed conservation in MSY estimation as compared to ASPIC. Moreover, ASPIC results showed higher R 2 values. Considering the MSY estimates, it is recommended that target reference point of MSY for cephalopod fishery resource in Pakistani marine waters should be around 4,900-5,000 t. Harvest of this fishery resource beyond 5,200 t should be considered as limiting reference point. Thus, concrete steps are directly needed to conserve this fishery resource for future.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Study design: Case control comparative study. Period: 1st August 2013 to 31st March 2014. Setting: Gyn/Obs Department at Sir Syed Hospital Karachi. Material and Methods: A comparative study was carried out on 2 groups of parturient ladies. The study group comprised of those ladies who at the time of delivery (vaginal delivery/caesarean-section) had clinically cord around the neck while the other group (control) did not have nuchal cord. Duration of labour, mode of delivery were noted. Perinatal outcome was measured in terms of Apgar score and NICU admission. High risk pregnancies were excluded from the study. Result: Incidence of nuchal cord at the time of delivery was 22.7%. A high rate of caesarean delivery observed in study group as compared to control group (70% vs 40%)(P value 0.00006). Fetal heart rate irregularities & meconium stained liquor finding was not significantly different in two groups (p< 0.161) & (p< 0.169) respectively. Similarly fetal outcome measured in terms of Apgar score at 1 & 5 min & NICU admission was also not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: A significant high rate of caesareans section rate was observed in the study group mainly due to fetal distress (FHR irregularities). This means cord around the neck is a risk factor & needs extra monitoring specially through intermittent CTG monitoring during labour so that fetal distress can be picked up early & emergency caesarean section can be performed to avoid fetal compromise.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Assessment of maximum sustainable yield of Acanthopagrus berda from Pakistani marine waters by applying surplus production models\n", "abstract": " Picnic Sea bream (Acanthopagrus berda) fishery in the Northern Arabian Sea from Pakistani marine waters was analyzed using catch and effort data (1991-2008). Maximum, minimum and average catch was recorded as 1088 mt in 1999, 586 mt in 1991 and 828 mt year-1 respectively. MSY (Maximum sustainable yield) and other key fish population parameters of K (carrying capacity), q (catchability coefficient), r (intrinsic population growth rate) and CV (coefficient variation) values of the calculated MSY were estimated by CEDA (catch and effort data analysis) and ASPIC (a surplus production model incorporating covariates) computer software packages. The fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield FMSY = 0.114 from logistic model and FMSY= 0.057 from Fox model was estimated by ASPIC. The stock biomass given MSY BMSY = 11990 (CV= 0.083) from Fox model and MSY BMSY = 13630 (CV= 0.037) was estimated in ASPIC. In CEDA the initial proportion (IP) of 0.5 was used, because starting catch was approximately 50% of the maximum catch. The estimated results of MSY using CEDA with three surplus production models Fox, Schaefer and Pella Tomlinson under three error assumptions of Normal, Log-Normal and Gamma were about 620-800 mt, which was lower than the catch of 897 mt in 2008, indicating that the A. berda fishery in the marine waters of Pakistan has been overexploited, therefore it is suggested that measures should be taken to reduce fishing effort for the rational exploitation of the fishery.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}
{"title": "Stock Assessment of Molluscan Fisheries in Pakistani Marine Waters by using CEDA and ASPIC computer packages\n", "abstract": " Molluscan fishery input and output data, 1999-2009, from Pakistani marine waters was analyzed by using two specialized software, CEDA and ASPIC, used in fisheries management. The highest and the lowest molluscan catch values were observed in 1999 (10208 t) and 2006 (6162 t) respectively, with an average catch of 8109 t y-1. Among five surplus production models (SPMs) used in this study, three were from CEDA i.e. Fox, Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson along with log error assumption and two were from ASPIC i.e. Fox and Logistic. Calculated MSY and R2 values for CEDA models, by using IP (B1/K) of 1, were 8449 t, 7248 t, 7248 t and 0.52, 0.50, 0.50 respectively. While for ASPIC, their values remained 8527 t, 7343 t and 0.711, 0.698 in that order. Computed MSY values, along with higher values of R2, validate ASPIC results as compared to CEDA and suggest that overall this fishery resource is in safe condition and in future catch should be managed at current level. However, molluscan fisheries sub-groups should be further investigated for their stock status.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}
{"title": "Production of synthetic gas from agriculture and forest wastes using fixed bed gasifier\n", "abstract": " Gasification is a process that converts organic/agricultural wastes (carbonaceous materials) into synthetic gas. Particularly field crop residues being generated in the country on large scale can be gasified and converted into the synthetic gas (SYNGAS) by the gasification process. This research paper reports the results of gas generated from three different types of agriculture and forest wastes ie cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop waste, neem (Azadirachta indica) tree barks and leaves through gasification process. The results obtained from the study indicated that the SYNGAS generated from cotton crop waste was almost similar to that of generated from neem tree barks. However, the SYNGAS obtained from neem tree barks and leaves was higher in fixed carbon. There was a slight difference in the composition of gases obtained from different wastes. The gas obtained from cotton crop waste had 27.52% CO and 32.17% H 2; the gas obtained from neem tree barks had 28.72% CO and 31.88% H 2. Similarly, the gases obtained from neem tree leaves had 26.07% CO and 28.12% H 2. It can be concluded from these results that the gasfication process of generating SYNGAS from agricultural and forest wastes available in the country can be used as an alternate of natural gas LPG, Dimethyl ether, etc. to run the power houses and mechanical vehicles.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Simulating the Production Strategies for Optimization of the Gas Recovery from a Water Drive Dry Gas Reservoir\n", "abstract": " The water drive is the most economical natural drive mechanism. The recovery factor of water drive dry gas reservoir is about 45-70% when produced under conventional restricted approach. The reason for this is that the water encroaches into the gas zone and traps the gas. Hence, the production strategies such as the conventional approach, blow down approach and coproduction on a heterogeneous reservoir to optimize the gas production may be used. The co-production strategy has provided the good results with an encouraging recovery factor. It may be found to be more economically feasible in comparison to other production strategies.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Should We Be Concerned About Street Identifications?\n", "abstract": " The use of street identification procedures\u2013informal procedures in which witnesses attempt to identify an offender, usually soon after the commission of a crime and close to where it occurred\u2013has attracted significant concern. These procedures are generally thought to give rise to a greater risk of mistaken identification because they lack the safeguards of formal procedures conducted under controlled conditions. This article describes the findings of empirical research undertaken by the authors. The research had three broad objectives. The first was to collect data which would provide some indication of the extent to which street identifications are used by police in England and Wales. The second was to compare the reliability of street identifications and video identification procedures involving the use of foils. The final objective was to investigate the influence that a street identification procedure would have on a subsequent video identification procedure involving the same witness and suspect. The findings suggest that substantial numbers of street identifications are conducted but, perhaps counter-intuitively, in terms of the risk of mistaken identification of innocent suspects, such procedures may be no less reliable than video identification procedures. Following identification of a suspect in a street identification, there is a very high likelihood that a formal procedure involving the same suspect and witness will result in the suspect being identified again, notwithstanding that the suspect is innocent.It is widely acknowledged that our attempts at identifying others are stalked by significant risk of error.

Hybrid process of coagulation-adsorption was utilized for an effective reduction of wastewater pollutants concentration with the use of commercial coagulants namely Ferric chloride (FeCl3), Ferrous Sulfate (FeSO4) and Alum [Al2 (SO4) 3] and bottom based coal ash (BBCA) as an adsorbent. An effective adsorbent was prepared from coal power plant ash waste by physico-chemical treatment in order to enhance its physical properties. The removal efficiencies of pollutants for each individual and combined process were determined keeping contact time, agitation rate, equilibrium conditions similar in each case except for the dosages of chemicals added to suit the pollutants removal rates. Adsorptive capacity and adsorption (%) of BBCA adsorbent was determined for adsorption of organic pollutants along with dosage effects. Adsorption isotherm models such as Langmuir and Freundlich were applied for the determination of adsorption suitability and their mechanism. Both processes reduced the concentration of Chemical oxygen demand (COD), coloring matter, turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) in the range of 60-70%, whereas, hybrid process of coagulation and adsorption optimized the treatment efficiency up to 80%. The overall treatment efficiency with FeCl3-BBCA, FeSO4-BBCA and Alum-BBCA was observed as 80%, 78% and 73%, respectively.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Half of the participants were instructed to respond honestly and to help with an investigation; the other half were instructed to distort their statement so they were not implicated. Participants did not know whether they would be asked to lie or report honestly during their time in the professor\u2019s office. After completing the task, participants again met with a research assistant, who instructed them whether to lie or respond honestly at a one-week follow-up. After the interview, participants completed a Likert-type post-event questionnaire. Deceivers reported significantly more anxiety and motivation not to get caught while in the office, even though there were no differences in the instructions given to the two groups until after participants left the office. Therefore, the act of deception changed their memory for their time in the office. This is important theoretically because it suggests that forming a lie script could be akin to other memories for counterfactual thinking. Practically, it is important to note that a deceptive perpetrator or detainee may never be able to actually provide an accurate account.Though a great deal of research attention has been given to post-event memory distortion, only a few researchers have focused on memory change as a result of deception. Pickel (1) reported two such studies.

{"title": "Enhancing Testing Technologies for Globalization of Software Engineering and Productivity\n", "abstract": " While successful at increasing code churn rates, global software development and evolution suffers from several quality assurance challenges. First, sub-groups within developer communities often work on loosely coupled parts of the application code. Each developer (sub-group) typically modifies a local \u201ccopy\u201d of the code and frequently checks-in changes (and downloads other developers\u2019 changes). Consequently, after making a change, a developer may not immediately realize that the local change has inadvertently broken other parts of the overall software code. This situation is compounded as there is little direct inter-developer communication--almost all communication is done via web-based tools such as code commit log messages, bug reports, change-requests, and comments.

{"title": "Using GUI run-time state as feedback for test automation\n", "abstract": " Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the sole mode of interaction between end-users and back-end code for almost all of today's software applications.  Because of this strategic role of GUIs, their quality has become important. During GUI testing, test cases---modeled as sequences of user events---sample the vast input space of all possible sequences with the goal of detecting faults; for effective testing, it is important to sample this space carefully.  Existing techniques either sample manually or employ manually constructed abstract models---the abstraction and/or subsequent test-case generation algorithms enable sampling.  This report presents an alternative approach to GUI testing -- it's focus is on developing a fully automatic model-driven technique to generate GUI test cases.  The technique is novel in that it uses feedback from the execution of a ``seed test suite'' on a GUI. The seed suite is generated automatically using an existing structural event-interaction graph (EIG) model of the GUI.  During its execution, the run-time effect of each GUI event on all other events pinpoints new important event-semantic interaction (ESI) relationships between them, which are used to automatically create an ESI graph (ESIG) model and generate new test cases.  Together with a reverse-engineering algorithm used to obtain the EIG, seed suite, ESIG, and new test cases, the feedback-based technique yields a fully automatic, end-to-end GUI testing process.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Fraunhofer Center for Experimental Software Engineering, University of Maryland\n", "abstract": " An increasingly important but expensive part of a software\u2019s development process is its maintenance. Maintenance activities account for as much as two-thirds of the overall cost of software production [34, 29, 37]. Regression testing, a necessary maintenance activity, is performed on modified software to provide confidence that (1) the software behaves correctly, and (2) modifications have not adversely affected the software\u2019s quality. Regression testing can account for as much as one-half of the cost of software maintenance [3]. A software\u2019s use of a graphical user interface (GUI) can significantly raise its cost of regression testing. GUIs constitute as much as half of the software\u2019s code [19, 26]. GUI software requires frequent retesting because GUIs are typically designed using rapid prototyping [26], in which the GUI software is modified and tested on a continuous basis. Special characteristics of GUIs, such as event-driven input and graphical output, present a new set of challenges to the problem of GUI regression testing, requiring the development of new solutions. Although regression testing of conventional software has received a lot of attention [6, 32, 34, 35], there has been almost no reported research on GUI regression testing. The exception is White [40] who proposes a Latin square method to reduce the size of the regression test suite. The underlying assumption is that it is enough to check pair-wise interactions between menu-items of the GUI. The technique requires that each menuitem appear in at least one test case. This strategy seems promising since it also employs GUI events. However, the technique needs to be extended to GUI items\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

Electrical and IR measurements show that the pure powder state sample is a semiconductor, the ceramic Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8 sample prepared after annealing at 820\u00b0C for 240 hours shows a Tc of 85 K, whereas Bi2Sr2Ca1Cu2O8 sample prepared through glassy route, i.e. melting at 1250\u00b0C and annealing at 820\u00b0C for 240 hours shows a drop of Tc by 5 K. The infrared spectra of superconducting ceramic and glass ceramic states in the available frequency range of measurement reveals the presence of three phonons. Since the vibrational mode around 595 cm\u22121 is due to CuO2 layers and as the CuO2 layers are responsible for Tc in the ceramic superconductors, any change in these layers will affect the Tc.

As viewed in global tectonic perspective Moeslan and Indian Plates have played important role in Alpine Himalayan Orogeny; Moesian and Indian Platforms are extension of these respective plates. Characteristics features of both the platforms are block faulting which has effected not only the general tectonic framework but has also played important role in oil accumulation. Main producing rocks in the Moesian platform are Jurassic sandstones and cretaceous limestones while in the indian platform cretaceous sandstones are important reservoirs. The average geothermal gradient in the indian platform is 2.45 C/100m with the higher gradients in the central gas producing region. Geothermal gradients in the Moesian platform have an average value of 3 C/100m with higher gradients in the northern in the northern part. Some of the producing structures in both the platforms are remarkably similar, traps associated with normal faults are very important. Extensive exploration carried in the Moesian Platform makes it very important oil producing region of Romania. After the discovery of oil lower Sindh, serious exploration is being carried in the Indian platform. The paper deals with the similarities between these two important platforms. In the light of the studies of the Moesian platform, strategies or exploration of oil and gas in the Indian Platform are suggested.(author)", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Long wavelength optical phonons in mixed alkali halide powder crystals\n", "abstract": " It is well known that crystalline alkali halides have a single lattice vibrational frequency (the reststrahlen band), which depends on the atomic masses and the interatomic forces. The vibrational behavior of a mixed alkali halide crystal depends on the concentration of the components/3/. The conditions necessary for the two types of behavior observed in mixed crystals, eg, one-mode or two-mode behavior, and the condition necessary for the existence of a localized and gap mode have been discussed in detail previously/4 to 8/. In our system, there is a frequency overlap between the reststrahlen bands of the constituents, and a single lattice mode appears whose frequency lies between the vibrational frequencies of the constituents. Far-infrared techniques Measurements were carried out on the far-infrared asymmetric Fourier spectrometer described by Russell and Bell/9/. By replacing the fixed mirror with the mixed-crystal sample, we were able directly to measure the amplitude reflectivity and the phase shift upon reflection from the sample. To cover the frequency spectrum of 30 to 300 em-', beam splitters of thicknesses 6.25 and 12.5 pm were used. The detector was a liquid helium cooled bolometer.

In the earlier period of our management of patients with Tetra logy of Fallot we deliberately selected older children for shunt surgery, who were severely symptomatic and severely cyanosed. However in the later period criteria for shunt operation and primary correction were developed. The use of Hypothermia and cardioplegia now allows for a great relaxation of the heart and thus this approach of respecting the right ventricular outflow tract without ventriculotomy need to be retried since the integrity of conduit over succeeding years cannot be assured. It is concluded that over the 2.5 years of our surgical experience greater and younger patients are undergoing palliative and corrective operations with improved survival.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "EFFECT OF ASCORBIC ACID IN HEAT STRESSED BROILER CHICKENS OF SINDH ZONE\n", "abstract": " The research was conducted under climatic conditions of Sindh zone, to observe the effect of ascorbic acid on broiler chickens. A total of 120-day old broiler chicks were randomly divided into two groups. Control (Cont.) group and Ascorbic acid (AA) group. Cont. group reared without any supplementation, while dose of 200mg/kg ascorbic acid was supplemented in AA group. Birds were reared on the litter housing system. These parameters were observed: feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, water intake, nutrients digestibility, antibody titer, body temperature, carcass weight, dressing percentage, fat pads, and relative weight of edible and non-edible organs. The results of this study revealed that weight gain, antibody titre, carcass weight, nutrients retention (crude protein, ether extract, crude fiber and metabolized energy) were significantly higher in AA supplementary group. Whereas feed conversion ratio, water intake, Fat pad, liver weight and body temperature observed significantly (P< 0.05) lower in AA supplementary group. It was concluded that 200mg/kg of ascorbic acid supplementation improved the nutrients digestibility, higher the weight gain, better the feed efficiency, carcass weight and maintain the optimum water consumption. The dosage rate of 200mg/kg may be provided in the feed of heat stressed broiler chickens under the climatic conditions of Sindh zone.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}

{"title": "Model-driven software tools for configuring and customizing middleware for distributed real-time and embedded systems\n", "abstract": " Middleware is increasingly being used to develop and deploy largescale distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems in domains ranging from avionics to industrial process control and financial services. To support a wide range of DRE systems with diverse quality of service (QoS) needs, middleware platforms often provide scores of options and configuration parameters that enable it to be customized and tuned for different use cases. Supporting this level of variability, however, can significantly complicate middleware and application configuration. This problem is exacerbated for developers of DRE systems by the lack of documented patterns of middleware configuration and customization (C&C) that resolve key variability challenges. This paper describes how domain-specific languages and model-driven generative programming techniques can be used by middleware developers to codify reusable patterns of middleware configuration and customization.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["302"]}
