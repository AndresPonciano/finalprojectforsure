{"title": "Factors Oriented Test Case Prioritization Technique in Regression Testing using Genetic Algorithm\n", "abstract": " Test case prioritization involves scheduling test cases in an order that increases the effectiveness in achieving some performance goals. One of the most important performance goals is the rate of fault detection. Test cases should run in an order that increases the possibility of fault detection and also that detects the most severe faults at the earliest in its testing life cycle. In this paper, we develop and validate requirement based system level test case prioritization scheme to reveal more severe faults at an earlier stage and to improve customer-perceived software quality using Genetic Algorithm (GA). For this, we propose a set of prioritization factors to design the proposed system. In our proposed technique, we refer to these factors as Prioritization Factors (PF). These factors may be concrete, such as test case length, code coverage, data flow, and fault proneness, or abstract, such as perceived code complexity and severity of faults, which prioritizes the system test cases based on the six factors: customer priority, changes in requirement, implementation complexity, completeness, traceability and fault impact. The goodness of these orderings was measured using an evaluation metric called APFD and PTR that will also be calculated.", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["437"]}

It is a great idea to go to utilize 5G remote advancement and man-made thinking to engage speedier response times, lower latency, improved upkeep in figuring. The cloud has at no other time been so essential to the undertaking beforehand. This is where Edge Computing came into picture\u2014seen as an expansion to the cloud, yet interesting in a couple of crucial ways. Empowering data to be taken care of, explored and moved at the edge of the framework, edge enlisting will enable undertakings to gather and assessments data closer to where it is taken care of, consistently, without idleness. Thus it can take into consideration snappy substance conveyance and information preparing that ought to be the eventual fate of registering. In this paper we will extensively study the necessity of Edge Cloud simulation environment and simulate it through EdgeCloudSim. We find that the utilization based, fuzzy competitor based and hybrid based methodologies incline toward offloading the assignments to the edge, so they give better outcomes whereas the average service time of the Fuzzy-Based methodology is least in contrast with the others.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["437"]}
{"title": "Energy Efficient, Lifetime Improving And Secure Periodic Data Collection Protocol For Wireless Sensor Networks\n", "abstract": " The most emerging prominent sensor network applications collect data from sensor nodes and monitors periodically. Resource constraint Sensor motes sense the environment and transit data to the remote sink via multiple hops. Minimum energy dissipation and secure data transmission are crucial to such applications. This paper delivers an energy efficient, lifetime improving, secure periodic Data Gathering scheme that is a hybrid of heuristic path establishment and secure data transmission. This protocol uses artificial intelligence (AI) based A* heuristic search algorithm to establish energy efficient admissible optimal path to sink in terms of high residual energy, minimum hop counts and high link quality. This scheme also adopts block encryption Rivest Cipher (RC6) Algorithm to secure the transmission of packets. This code and speed optimized block encryption provides confidentiality against critical data and consumes less energy for encryption. This proposed method increases the network lifetime there by reducing the total traffic load. Evaluation of performance analysis of this algorithm using Network Simulator (NS2) shows the superiority of the proposed scheme.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["437"]}
{"title": "Multi-Factor Approach for Effective Regression Testing using Test Case Optimization\n", "abstract": " Regression testing intends to ensure that a software applications works as specified after changes have been made to it, is an important phase in software development lifecycle. Regression testing is the re-execution of some subset of test that has already been conducted. In regression testing, number of regression tests increases and it is impractical and inefficient to re execute every test for every application or function when change occurs. It is an expensive testing process used to detect regression faults. Regression testing has been used to support software-testing activities and assure acquiring an appropriate quality through several versions of a software product during its development and maintenance. Test suites can be large and conducting regression tests is tedious. Regression testing assures the quality of modified applications against unintended changes. The test case selection and prioritization is important in regression testing. Test case prioritization seeks to find an efficient ordering of test case execution for regression testing. Test case prioritization is used in regression testing, at the test suite level, with the goal of detecting faults as early as possible in the regression testing process, given a test suite inherited from previous versions of the system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["437"]}
{"title": "A Quantitative Measurement of Software Requirement Factors using Goal Question Metric (GQM) Approach\n", "abstract": " Every application software that we propose to develop can be thought of a group or collection of related requirements specified by the user and these requirements are the foundation from which the quality of the software is measured. Until now there is no concrete measurement methodology for measuring the requirements of any application software. A new value driven quantitative measurement approach is presented in this research work. These values associated with each of the requirements are collectively called as Requirement Factor Values (RFV). This new measurement method uses the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach and it is one of the most powerful approaches available for metrics measurement. In this work, seven factors-customer priority of requirements, implementation complexity, changes in requirements, fault impact of requirements, completeness traceability and execution time are considered to be the primary ingredients of every requirement of the software and every requirement is characterized by the numerical values of these factors. A Java based application system has been developed that takes questionnaires, various parameters/values associated with each of the requirements and generates these factor values for each requirement of the software. These requirement factor values can be used in many ways such as measuring the quality of the software, test case design and optimization, test case prioritization.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["437"]}

People use social sites to find and make friends, to associate with people who share comparable intrigue, trade news, organize the event, exploring passion. According to a Facebook review, 5% of monthly active users had fake accounts, and in the last six months, Facebook has deleted 3 billion accounts. According to the Washington Post, Twitter has suspended over 1 billion suspect accounts over a day in recent months. Detection of a fake profile is one of the critical issues these days as people hold fake accounts to slander image, spread fake news, promote sarcasm that has attracted cybercriminals in. There are numerous machine learning methodologies, such as supervised learning and SVM-NN, and they are produced for the effective detection of a fake profile.
