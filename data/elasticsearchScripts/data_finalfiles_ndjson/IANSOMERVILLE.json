{"title": "Socio-technical systems: From design methods to systems engineering\n", "abstract": " It is widely acknowledged that adopting a socio-technical approach to system development leads to systems that are more acceptable to end users and deliver better value to stakeholders. Despite this, such approaches are not widely practised. We analyse the reasons for this, highlighting some of the problems with the better known socio-technical design methods. Based on this analysis we propose a new pragmatic framework for socio-technical systems engineering (STSE) which builds on the (largely independent) research of groups investigating work design, information systems, computer-supported cooperative work, and cognitive systems engineering. STSE bridges the traditional gap between organisational change and system development using two main types of activity: sensitisation and awareness; and constructive engagement. From the framework, we identify an initial set of interdisciplinary research\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1004\n", "authors": ["38"]}

These findings seem significant enough to call for a migration of the system to the cloud but our stakeholder impact analysis revealed that there are significant risks associated with this.

{"title": "Research challenges for enterprise cloud computing\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing represents a shift away from computing as a product that is purchased, to computing as a service that is delivered to consumers over the internet from large-scale data centers - or \"clouds\". This paper discusses some of the research challenges for cloud computing from an enterprise or organizational perspective, and puts them in context by reviewing the existing body of literature in cloud computing. Various research challenges relating to the following topics are discussed: the organizational changes brought about by cloud computing; the economic and organizational implications of its utility billing model; the security, legal and privacy issues that cloud computing raises. It is important to highlight these research challenges because cloud computing is not simply about a technological improvement of data centers but a fundamental change in how IT is provisioned and used. This type of research has the potential to influence wider adoption of cloud computing in enterprise, and in the consumer market too.", "num_citations": "306\n", "authors": ["38"]}

We wish to move beyond this by allowing for the provision of a more systematic incorporation of the social dimensions of work. To this end we focus on developing a novel approach to the presentation of ethnographic material.

We believe that by investigating and characterising the real-world work of testing we can help question why such \u0393\u00c7\u00ffbad practices\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 occur and how improvements might be made. We also argue that the testing literature is too focused on technological issues when many of the problems, and indeed strengths, have as much do with work and organisation. In this paper we use empirical examples from four systems engineering projects to demonstrate how and in what ways testing is a cooperative activity. In particular we demonstrate the ways in which testing is situated within organisational work and satisfices organisational and marketplace\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "91\n", "authors": ["38"]}

{"title": "Workload classification & software energy measurement for efficient scheduling on private cloud platforms\n", "abstract": " At present there are a number of barriers to creating an energy efficient workload scheduler for a Private Cloud based data center. Firstly, the relationship between different workloads and power consumption must be investigated. Secondly, current hardware-based solutions to providing energy usage statistics are unsuitable in warehouse scale data centers where low cost and scalability are desirable properties. In this paper we discuss the effect of different workloads on server power consumption in a Private Cloud platform. We display a noticeable difference in energy consumption when servers are given tasks that dominate various resources (CPU, Memory, Hard Disk and Network). We then use this insight to develop CloudMonitor, a software utility that is capable of >95% accurate power predictions from monitoring resource consumption of workloads, after a \"training phase\" in which a dynamic power model is developed.", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["38"]}

{"title": "Designing appropriate assistive technology for home users: developing dependable networks\n", "abstract": " This paper is concerned with explicating some of the multiple concerns involved in designing appropriate assistive technology in domestic, or home, settings. As society becomes increasingly reliant on computer-based systems, and as domestic settings become increasingly technologised (Dewsbury 2001), the systems themselves have become increasingly complex and the need for dependable systems correspondingly important. Achieving sufficient dependability in these systems, and demonstrating this achievement in a rigorous and convincing manner, appears crucial in moving towards an inclusive Information Society. The paper reflects our interest in making some initial steps towards developing improved means of specifying, designing, assessing, deploying and maintaining complex socio-technical systems in domestic contexts where high dependability is crucial. As computer-based systems and artefacts penetrate more and more into people\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s everyday lives and homes, the \u0393\u00c7\u00ffdesign problem\u0393\u00c7\u00d6is not so much concerned with the creation of new technical artefacts as it is with their effective and dependable configuration and integration.

Our goal is to represent complex contingency plans so that they can be more readily understood, so that inconsistencies can be highlighted and vulnerabilities discovered. In this paper, we outline the framework for contingency planning in the UK and introduce the notion of responsibility models as a means of representing the key features of contingency plans. Using a case study of a flooding emergency, we illustrate our approach to responsibility modelling and suggest how it adds value to current textual contingency plans.

The ontology enables effective ways of sharing and reusing the knowledge and the project information for remote software engineers and software developers. Reaching a consensus of understanding is of benefit in a distributed multi-site software development environment. Software engineering knowledge is represented in the software engineering ontology whose instantiations are undergoing evolution. Software engineering ontology instantiations signify project information which is shared and has evolved to reflect project development, changes in software requirements or in the design process, to incorporate additional functionality to systems or to allow incremental improvement, etc. This evolution of instances provides many new challenges to an ability to design and deliver project information. In this paper, we present platforms development to facilitate software engineering ontology instantiations management.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["38"]}

Although we have argued that the structures of these systems cannot accurately be united in a single form in a model (or series of models) we believe that a structural approach allows us to make deeper, more fundamental, connections between them and may aid in mediating between the rich descriptions of field studies and the abstract modelling of technical design.             This can be achieved in actual projects through a practical (rather than theoretical) consideration of fit between the structure of the social systems and that of the technical systems.

Ethnographic studies have been used in particular to inform the requirements process from a social perspective. To make this accessible to requirements engineers, work in this area has focused on how to integrate and communicate ethnographic findings on a per project basis but scant attention has been paid to how findings from individual studies may be generalised and re-used for the purposes of RE in new settings. This paper is intended to introduce our resource of Patterns of Cooperative Interaction to the RE community. These patterns specifically compare and contrast a variety of ethnographic findings, discuss their relevance to design and provide an introduction to the analytic sensibilities of such studies. We discuss how we developed patterns of interaction from a corpus of ethnographic studies, illustrate a selection of these patterns and suggest how the patterns collection can be used by requirements engineers as a means of highlighting potential social issues that are or relevance to the system requirements and as a means of generating requirements that support social interaction.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["38"]}

Attempting a useful input into dependability processes requires an understanding of how technologies are integrated into a range of social contexts. However, to usefully consider issues of dependability we may require significant shifts in investigative techniques to consider how technology relates to and offers support for everyday living. Our'user groups' are former psychiatric patients and elderly and disabled people living at home. Methods for eliciting needs in'care'settings are relatively under-developed and represent a complex set of design and methodological challenges. Research in such contexts is often difficult and inappropriate and their deeply personal nature presents conventional ethnographic methods with obdurate problems.

We propose a novel method, Stakeholder Impact Analysis, that can be used to identify risks associated with socio-complexity as it is grounded in insights from the social sciences, psychology and management science. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Stakeholder Impact Analysis by using the 1992 London Ambulance Service Computer Aided Dispatch project as a case study, and shows that had our method been used to identify the risks and had they been mitigated, it would have reduced the risk of project failure. This paper's original contribution comprises expanding upon existing accounts of failure by examining failures at a level of granularity not seen elsewhere that enables the underlying socio-complexity sources of risk to be identified.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["38"]}

This reconceptualisation of a role as a relationship rather than as a set of properties of a single entity has a number of implications for requirements elicitation, system design, and information structures. We explore some of the implications and requirements and show how they can lead to significantly different system architectures.

{"title": "Designing dependable digital domestic environments\n", "abstract": " The aim of this paper is to examine the distinctions between home and organizational settings with particular reference to assistive technologies (AT) and outline a model for assessing dependability issues in these environments. For the purposes of this paper we consider assistive technologies to be software-controlled networks of assistive devices. Clearly a home is a personal concept and a social construction, which imbues different meanings to each individual through social actions and the assignment of meaning to those actions. It is therefore important that any method of investigation is sensitive to the changing meanings and nature of people\u0393\u00c7\u00d6s conceptions of home. This paper outlines the fundamental concepts used by the Lancaster team and proposes a method of conceptualizing dependability within a home context.This paper suggests that the design of AT involves a number of factors that can be derived from a number of sources but essentially all design should place the user at the centre of the process. We aim to show that the home is different from the standard organization and as such deserves consideration in its own right and technology systems need to meet certain criteria within domestic situations that are not covered within traditional organizations. We extend this notion by considering the use of AT in terms of previous models of design and assessment. We also acknowledge that older people are not a homogenous category, and that designing for a group requires sensitivity to the individual needs of the person rather than the categorization of the person.

{"title": "Supporting informality in the software process\n", "abstract": " Since the emergence of software engineering as a discipline in the late 1960's, the conventional wisdom has been, in essence, that many of the problems underlying the software'crisis' were due to the fact that the methods used to develop software products were informal and, indeed, that the software process itself was an informal process. The proposed solutions were therefore that we should formalise, as far as possible, the methods used for development. Initial efforts at formalisation focused on the programming process but the emergence of structured methods and, later, formal specifications, reinforced this assumption that a more formal approach was likely to be more productive at least in terms of quality if not in cost. In the 1980's comparable assumptions were made about the software process (and other business processes) itself.

Assessing the sociotechnical dependability of CoS is an open research question of societal importance as existing sociotechnical dependability analysis techniques typically do not assess threats associated with coalition partners reneging on responsibilities or leaving a coalition. We use a cloud computing based case study to demonstrate that a responsibility modeling based risk analysis approach enables the identification of these threats.

{"title": "Coherence: social analysis for software engineers\n", "abstract": " It is increasingly recognised that human, social, and political factors have a significant impact on software system design. To address this, ethnographic studies of work have been used to inform the system design process, especially in cooperative work settings where systems support several users working together. Based on our experience of these studies, we have investigated the integration of social analysis into the system design process. This paper introduces a method that provides support for social analysis and which has been designed for use alongside other approaches to system requirements analysis. New methods are unlikely to be adopted in industry unless they are capable of being integrated with existing practice. Our approach addresses this issue by helping identify use cases, generating initial use case models, and by using UML to represent social aspects of work that may have an impact on the design of computer based systems. This paper introduces the approach, and focuses on the support provided for social analysis. We have identified three social viewpoints, namely a distributed coordination viewpoint, a plans and procedures viewpoint and an awareness of work viewpoint.

If we are to provide more general design principles, we need techniques to facilitate generalization from ethnographic studies and to allow the results of such studies to be married with more general statements of design.

These patterns are organised around a framework and are inspired by how such regularities are highlighted in ethnomethodologically-informed ethnographic studies of work and technology. Our contention is that these patterns form a useful resource for re-using findings from previous field studies for enabling analysis and considering design in new settings. Previous work on the relationship between ethnomethodology and design has been concerned primarily in providing presentation frameworks and mechanisms, practical advice, schematisations of the ethnomethodologist's role, different possibilities of input at different stages in development, and various conceptualisations of the relationship between study and design.

It is a feature of many of these discussions that IT is handled in a somewhat simplistic fashion, often with a pronounced theoretical leaning resulting in\" the case of the disappearing technology\". Even empirical studies of new technology often fail to pay attention to the actual details of technology in use, instead focusing upon the part technology might play in producing certain managerial or workplace configurations that are themselves theoretical renderings of organisational life. By way of contrast, this paper presents some results from a long-term empirical investigation of computer systems in use in financial services that specifically aims to focus upon the actual details of technology in use. In addition it attempts to address conventional concerns with the relationship between new technology and'skill', productivity and other factors in a rather different fashion by focusing on the issue of'legacy'. We present a number of examples of legacy issues and try to delineate their impact on everyday working life.'Legacy', we argue, is not just a problem encountered by organisations with aging mainframes and dated software, it is an issue from the moment a computer system becomes an integral part of any organisation's everyday work.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["38"]}

{"title": "Designing for Recovery: New Challenges for Large-scale Complex IT Systems\n", "abstract": " Summary form only given. Since the 1980s, the object of design for dependability has been to avoid, detect or tolerate system faults so that these do not result in failures that are detectable outside the system. Whilst this is potentially achievable in medium size systems that are controlled by a single organisations, it is now practically impossible to achieve in large-scale systems of systems where different parts of the system are owned and controlled by different organisations. Therefore, we must accept the inevitability of failure and re-orient our system design strategies to recover from those failures at minimal cost and as quickly as possible. This talk will discuss why such recovery strategies cannot be purely technical but must be socio-technical in nature and argue that design for recovery will require a better understanding of how people recover from failure and the information they need during that recovery process\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["38"]}

We have many years of experience of ethnographic studies in a range of settings including air traffic control, software design, banking and healthcare. These studies revealed subtle and complex interactions between the people involved in work processes and contingent actions where people modify processes to allow work to be done. In some cases (eg air traffic control) it is clear that the subtle features of the work are central to the effective execution of the task and they must be considered in systems design. In other cases (eg software design), the insights gained from the studies were relevant to the design of the socio-technical system rather than specific to the supporting\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["38"]}

The main reason for looking at socio-technical systems is to explore the extent to which ideas of dependability, which have been developed for technical systems for some decades now, can be applied to socio-technical systems. It is no longer good enough simply to say that a failure was due to a computer error; in most cases there was a human error along the line too.

This paper argues that the areas of discovery, differentiation, negotiation, monitoring and non-repudiation of agreements cannot be considered in isolation to each other. The areas outlined above are examined, primarily from a trust perspective, focusing on the use of contracts to guarantee QoS attributes. The paper explores the need for greater standardisation in the area, to specify semantics more clearly; in doing so we outline the progress of our own QoSOnt QoS attribute specification ontology. The paper goes on to briefly discuss two tools; firstly, SQRM, designed to allow service discovery, querying and requirement specification utilising the QoSOnt ontology; and secondly, TRANSACT, an existing contract negotiation tool designed to provide end-to-end contracting, encompassing an automated negotiation engine.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["38"]}

It will explore how 'feminity', 'gender' and 'sexuality' are constructed by law. These concepts are both social and legal cobstructs. There are two consequences of this; the first is that as constructs, they are not fixed and immuntable. Social and legal concepts of what is feminine for example, are not static; they differ from generation to generation, from culture to culture, and within these confines they change and evolve. The second consequence is that, despite these rather obvious statements, English legal culture appears insistent in its belief that there is something fixed and immutable about these concepts. In this respect, legal culture is essentialist in its approach to women as legal subjects. In other words, law seeks the fundamental 'essence'of woman, the 'perfect' woman against whom all other women must be compared to and measured.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["38"]}

With the exception of a few classes of system, such as some embedded realtime software, most systems are interactive. There is a two-way communication between the information system and the user (s), and it is the user interface which is the component responsible for managing this communication. Such is the importance of providing a soundly designed user interface that Fischer [Fischer 89] observes that\" The success of new computer systems is judged less and less on processing speed and memory size and more and more on the quality of communication capabilities\"(meaning the quality of the user interface). The effort devoted to developing the user interface to a new software product which is to stand any chance of success in the market place reflects this.The increasing importance of systems' user interface components has driven the development of new paradigms of interaction. Of particular significance is the development of direct manipulation [Schneiderman 82] which permits users to interact directly with visual representations of program entities. This contrasts with traditional interaction mechanisms in which users may access entities\" indirectly\" via language abstractions such as command languages or menus. In general, direct manipulation interfaces succeed by providing representations of entities which embody tacit, visual\" clues\" to the nature of the operations which may be performed on entities.

Diversity has been absorbed as a domain for managerial intervention in all types of organisation. Although it might vanish like other management fads, the very idea of diversity as an object of management is an indicator of more profound trends in contemporary management and culture. The notion that human difference ought to be actively governed reveals important aspects of our view about the fundamental relationship between self and other in the world. Despite being of interest for philosophical anthropology, diversity management does not lend itself to direct philosophical investigation simply because it is not in itself a philosophical elaboration.

Attention needs to be paid to conflicting organisational objectives and hidden agendas. For various reasons, it is important that people agree on the problem the system is meant to help with. Many existing RE techniques try to reconcile conflicting requirements after eliciting them. We argue that negotiation over conflicting requirements can productively occur during their elicitation. Hence our focus is on the early,\u0393\u00c7\u00d6upstream\u0393\u00c7\u00d6stage when options and commitment are just beginning to emerge. Decisions made at this point often have profound and unanticipated consequences for the future of such systems. The dynamism of contemporary organisations and the short attention-spans of management suggests that requirement engineering techniques need to be lightweight and distributed. Drawing both on problem structuring methods found in management science and on design rationale techniques, we have developed a hybrid process and accompanying software tool support to facilitate consensual problem definition. Negotiation occurs through a combination of informal group problem structuring (cognitive mapping) and incremental formalisation (design rationale) of requirements. Field trials indicate that parts of the negotiation can be conducted asynchronously, others require group work with a facilitator.

{"title": "Human and social aspects in process modelling\n", "abstract": " The majority of work in software process modelling has a technological focus. It is concerned with the technical activities and tools used in software development. However, the software process is also a human, social process and this aspect is almost completely neglected in existing process models and process support systems. Given the importance of social activities in our everyday life, it is therefore not surprising that software process modelling has not lived up to its initial promise and has not yet made a significant contribution to process cost reduction or process quality improvement in the vast majority of software development organisations.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["38"]}
{"title": "Management and integrated tools\n", "abstract": " After a brief overview, tools representing a broad spectrum of management features are described in separate presentations. DSCC and Configuration Management Assistant offer a user-definable development framework in which other tools and systems can be included. Amplify Control, EAST IPSE, and Epos are integrated project-management software-engineering systems that provide specific functions in such development frameworks. Aisle, is also such a system but with the even more specific purpose of aiding Ada developers. The Integrated Test Tool System is a utility system that can be integrated with the output of an integrated programming environment to test and validate the results of development efforts, either in Ada, C, Cobol, Fortran, or Pascal. CASE-PM is an example of a learning tool being used by software-engineering students.< >", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["38"]}

It looks at the problems of including courses in software engineering in a traditlonal computer sclence undergraduate curriculum. The nain part of the paper describes how these problems have been tackled in the computer science departrnent at the University of Strathclyde where courses in practical software engineering are a compulsory part of the curriculum. The paper concludes thaL it is impractical to teach students to be software engineers but that courses in software engineering are useful so that students are introduced to the problems which they might encounter in building large software systems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["38"]}
{"title": "Patterns of cooperative interaction\n", "abstract": " Increasingly, researchers and practitioners acknowledge the importance of understanding the social systems of work or activity into which any technical design solution will be implemented. Field studies (often known as ethnographies) are a way of understanding work as it is practiced. They help us understand\" real-world, real-time work\" in given settings. The attention to detail in describing and explaining how work is organized provides a useful resource for system designers. The studies help them to understand the activities that should be supported in a new design and to identify processes that do not work well and need to be re-designed.However, the results of these ethnographies are tied to a specific situation so there have always been problems of generalizing findings and re-using them to assist designers faced with a new situation.

{"title": "A Framework for Automatic Reconstruction of a Semi-Structured Rationale from a Minutes Document\n", "abstract": " This paper discusses Tracker, a framework for meeting management. Many meeting support tools and groupware tools now implement the second generation DR protocols characterized by cheap capture and rich multimedia content. Managing such content requires the manual introduction of annotations to support efficient retrieval. However, to do this in a truly useful manner, the capture and management of these documents (decisions rationale) should encompass not only the annotation of the multimedia content for playback, but should support the extraction of relevant information at the level of semantics and pragmatics: i.e. they should be able to automatically extract information such as what subjects were discussed, what decisions were made, what tasks were assigned. We demonstrate how to achieve such an endeavor in this paper.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["38"]}
{"title": "Promoting virtual social interaction with older people\n", "abstract": " This paper charts the development of a software platform and applications designed specifically for older people to promote communication and sociability. Through this we attempt to help alleviate isolation or loneliness by providing appropriate informal communication and virtual interaction. The software has been developed using a person-centred design approach that specifically favours simplicity and flexibility of use over functionality and power. Early participation from the older people was in the form of adapted cultural probes [8]. As the design progressed participation took the form of iterative criticism of the design, and informal user tests with older people. The system allows older people to easily discover who else is currently using the system, and therefore potentially available to chat with, interact with or play games with. The games also allow voice chat so players can socialise while playing. The application of this software has the possible use of encouraging intergenerational communication.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["38"]}

The authors describe facilities which have been included in a configuration language called PCL to support the process of system installation. PCL is used to support the installation of two classes of distributed system. These are distributed applications where a single,'logical'system is structured as a set of processes which may execute concurrently on separate processors and multi-copy applications where the same system is installed on several different nodes in a network. PCL can describe both hardware and software systems. This has allowed the authors to extend the language with a description of constraints on system installation and with facilities for specifying where particular software is to be installed. They use a special purpose installation tool (PCL-Install) to interpret installation instructions. The advantages of this approach are that installation procedures are easy to write and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["38"]}

Integrated project support environments are not widely used and their benefits have not been demonstrated. A bottom-up approach to environment construction which starts with an environment architecture is doomed to commercial failure. Environments will only be successful if they reduce software development costs and if they are structured so that they may be purchased bit-by-bit according to need. Development costs can be reduced with cooperative systems development. The author looks at CASE environments for cooperative systems development.< >", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["38"]}
