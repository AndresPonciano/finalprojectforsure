{"title": "Plasmon resonant enhancement of photocatalytic water splitting under visible illumination\n", "abstract": " We demonstrate plasmonic enhancement of photocatalytic water splitting under visible illumination by integrating strongly plasmonic Au nanoparticles with strongly catalytic TiO2. Under visible illumination, we observe enhancements of up to 66\u00d7 in the photocatalytic splitting of water in TiO2 with the addition of Au nanoparticles. Above the plasmon resonance, under ultraviolet radiation we observe a 4-fold reduction in the photocatalytic activity. Electromagnetic simulations indicate that the improvement of photocatalytic activity in the visible range is caused by the local electric field enhancement near the TiO2 surface, rather than by the direct transfer of charge between the two materials. Here, the near-field optical enhancement increases the electron\u2212hole pair generation rate at the surface of the TiO2, thus increasing the amount of photogenerated charge contributing to catalysis.

We also examined if the gender of the CEO affects the firm risk level, and if the compensation packages that boards give to female CEOs have less risky components than those given to male CEOs.Our results revealed new insights: on average, the gender of the CEO matters in terms of firm performance. When the CEO is a female, the firm risk level is smaller than when the CEO is a male. Another important finding is that boards are not attending to the risk aversion differences between male and female CEOs when they design the compensation packages, especially equity based compensation, which can be understood as an incentive to female CEOs to take risks.", "num_citations": "396\n", "authors": ["489"]}

The results show that only a little toluene can be partially oxidized into benzyl alcohol in the absence of O3, while it can be further oxidized into benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, maleic anhydride, and ultimately mineralized to CO2 in the presence of O3. The lattice oxygen is the oxygen species of oxidizing toluene into benzyl alcohol, and the active oxygen species generated from ozone decomposition on the oxygen vacancy over the catalysts are responsible for its complete oxidation.

In abstract syntax form, a well-formed sequence diagram corresponds to an ordered hierarchical structure tree. The static semantics of a sequence diagram is to check whether it is consistent with the class diagram declaration as well as with its well-formed tree structure. Meanwhile, the dynamic semantics is defined in terms of the state transitions that are carried out by the method invocations in the diagram. When a message is executed, it must be consistent with system state, i.e., object diagram and the state diagrams of its related objects. The semantics clearly captures the consistency between sequence diagram with class diagram and state diagram.

The neuronal loss in the RGC layer (GCL) and superior colliculus (SC) was determined by Nissl staining. Retinal thickness was assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging. Retinal function was determined by pattern ERG and full-field flash ERG. Responses of pattern ERG, positive scotopic threshold response (pSTR), scotopic oscillatory potentials (OPs), and photopic negative response (PhNR) were analyzed.Results.: The ONC induced progressive neuronal loss in GCL and contralateral SC starting from 7 and 28 days following ONC, respectively. A linear correlation was observed between combined thickness of nerve fiber layer (NFL), GCL, and inner plexiform layer (IPL) imaged by SD-OCT and cell numbers in GCL. Only half of the normal BALB/cJ mice exhibited pattern ERG response, which was smaller and later compared to C57BL/6J mice. The ONC reduced pattern ERG and pSTR, but the reduction of pattern ERG was earlier than pSTR, preceding the anatomical cell loss in the GCL. The PhNR and scotopic OPs were not affected by ONC.Conclusions.: The SD-OCT and ERG can be used to monitor noninvasively retinal morphologic and functional changes induced by ONC.

In this study, U937 cells showed susceptible to apoptosis induced by 27 mM oridonin and an agonistic anti-Fas IgM mAb (CH-11)(500 ng/ml) as a Fas-sensitized positive control. Caspase 8 inhibitor z-IETD, but neither caspase 1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD nor caspase 10 inhibitor z-AEVD, effectively blocked oridonin-induced cell death as well as DNA fragmentation. Western blot analysis showed the up-regulated expression of Fas, FasL, and FADD, and down-regulated expression of procaspase 8, suggesting that Fas/FasL pathway was activated in oridonin-induced cell apoptosis. Further, stimulation of U937 cells with oridonin and CH11 resulted in significant ERK MAPK activation. However, inhibition of ERK by PD98059 reversed oridonin-induced cell death as well as the activation of caspase 8, indicating that ERK-mediated control occured upstream of caspase 8. Simultaneously, ERK activation accounted for the release of cytochrome c, but failed to influence decreased Bcl-2 expression induced by oridonin. Taken together, these results suggest that Fas/FasL signaling pathway-mediated ERK activation sensitized U937 cells to mitochondrial pathway-mediated apoptosis induced by oridonin.", "num_citations": "71\n", "authors": ["489"]}

Parthenolide (PN) has been proved to elicit a wide range of biological activities through its anti-inflammatory action in the treatment of migraine, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. To decide whether this effect applies to ischemic injury in brain, we therefore investigate the potential neuroprotective role of PN and the underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Saline, Vehicle, and PN groups and a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used. PN administered intraperitoneally immediately after cerebral ischemia and once daily on the following days.

For critical applications, the user of a component must ensure that it fits the requirements of the application. To achieve this, testing is a well-suited means when the source code of the components is not available. Robustness testing is a testing methodology to detect the vulnerabilities of a component under unexpected inputs or in a stressful environment. As components may fail differently in different states, we use a state machine based approach to robustness testing. First, a set of paths is generated to cover transitions of the state machine, and it is used by the test cases to bring the component into a specific control state. Second, method calls with invalid inputs are fed to the component in different states to test the robustness.

It was found that the addition of WO3 leads to a significant promoting effect on the low-temperature activity of Pt/TiO2 catalyst and the optimal loading is 2%. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) revealed the electron transfer from WO3 to Pt active sites, leading to the formation of metallic Pt, which is responsible for the low-temperature H2-SCR of NOx. In-situ DRIFTS demonstrated that the introduction of WO3 to Pt catalyst not only contributes to the formation of reactive adsorbed NOx species on the catalyst, but also promotes the formation of NH4+ species.

To investigate the effects of HTC on nitrogen transformation behaviors, pyrolysis of sewage sludge and the corresponding hydrochar were conducted. The results showed nitrogen in the hydrochar existed in more stable forms, making more nitrogen retained in the char for the hydrochar pyrolysis. Amine-N, heterocyclic-N and nitrile-N were detected in significant amounts for sewage sludge pyrolysis tar, which contributed to predominant (NH3\u00a0+\u00a0HCN)-N emission. Lower amine-N and heterocyclic-N content but higher alkyl nitrile-N content were observed in the hydrochar pyrolysis tar, which might explain the increase in HCN/NH3 ratio.

It is shown that the starting solution for the flow of the oscillating plate can be presented as the sum of the steady state and the transient solutions. For large times they tend to the steady state solutions which are independent of the initial conditions and are periodic in time. This gives a result for the shear stress at the bottom wall. The shear stress at the bottom wall is maximum or minimum at the middle of the plate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["489"]}
{"title": "Regular property guided dynamic symbolic execution\n", "abstract": " A challenging problem in software engineering is to check if a program has an execution path satisfying a regular property. We propose a novel method of dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) to automatically find a path of a program satisfying a regular property. What makes our method distinct is when exploring the path space, DSE is guided by the synergy of static analysis and dynamic analysis to find a target path as soon as possible. We have implemented our guided DSE method for Java programs based on JPF and WALA, and applied it to 13 real-world open source Java programs, a total of 225K lines of code, for extensive experiments. The results show the effectiveness, efficiency, feasibility and scalability of the method. Compared with the pure DSE on the time to find the first target path, the average speedup of the guided DSE is more than 258X when analyzing the programs that have more than 100 paths.", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["489"]}

The ultrafine structure is composed of alternate ferrite and martensite strips (i.e., lamellar structure) parallel to the rolling direction, and the strips are composted of very fine grains in an average size of 0.96\u00a0\u03bcm. Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) of the UFG DP steel was investigated by a slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) of hydrogen charged specimens. Compared with uniform structured steel obtained in normal quenching and tempering (QT) technology, the UFG DP steel exhibits markedly high resistance to HE at a tensile strength level of 1300\u00a0MPa. A fracture model based on plastic zone and stress distribution was proposed to explain the fracture process.

However, the effect of grafting on chlorophyll content in leaves was small. The effects of grafting on the net photosynthetic rate of functional leaf, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO_2 concentration were also small in each developing stage. Therefore, the photosynthetic rate of grafting plant increased mainly due to expanding total leaf area of melon plant.

However, safety and efficacy, the two most important aspects in cancer therapy, remain serious challenges. The specific expression or deletion of replication related genes in an adenovirus has been frequently utilized to regulate the cancer cell specificity of a virus. Accordingly, in this study, we deleted 24 bp in E1A (bp924-bp947) and the entirety of E1B, including those genes encoding E1B 55kDa and E1B19kDa. We used the survivin promoter (SP) to control E1A in order to construct a new adenovirus vector named Ad.SP.E1A(\u039424).\u0394E1B (briefly Ad.SPDD). HCCS1 (hepatocellular carcinoma suppressor 1) is a novel tumor suppressor gene that is able to specifically induce apoptosis in cancer cells. The expression cassette AFP-HCCS1-WPRE-SV40 was inserted into Ad.SPDD to form Ad.SPDD-HCCS1, enabling us to improve the safety and efficacy of oncolytic-mediated gene therapy for liver cancer. Ad.SPDD showed a decreased viral yield and less toxicity in normal cells but enhanced toxicity in liver cancer cells, compared with the cancer-specific adenovirus ZD55 (E1B55K deletion). Ad.SPDD-HCCS1 exhibited a potent anti-liver-cancer ability and decreased toxicity in vitro. Ad.SPDD-HCCS1 also showed a measurable capacity to inhibit Huh-7 xenograft tumor growth on nude mice.

{"title": "Nu clear Instrum ents and Methods in Phy sics Research B\n", "abstract": " Based on the Coulomb spike model, track formation depends strongly on the electrical resistivity of a material, and ion tracks form only in insulating materials. However, there are no systemic studies of the effect of resistivity on the track formation in materials, such as SrTiO 3 (STO), where with the addition of low concentrations of Nb, the resistivity dramatical ly decreases covering the entire electron ic regime from an insulating to conducting material. In this study, high energy (8.6 MeV/u) ion-induce d track formation in STO was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques as a function of Nb-doping concentrations. Contrary to the Coulomb spike model\u2019s predictions, the Nb-doping had no evident influence on track formation, as confirmed by both TEM and SAXS. This may be the result of the low electron density in the bulk material or the minor effect of the Nb-doping on the bonding in the material. In situ TEM studies of low energy (1 MeV Kr 2+) ion irradiations show that the low concentration doping has a minor influence on the crystalline-to-am orphous transformat ion as a result of subtle structural variations of incorporated impurity atoms. \u00d3 2013 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "A Hypercube-based Scalable Interconnection Network for Massively Parallel Computing.\n", "abstract": " An important issues in the design of interconnection networks for massively parallel computers is scalability. A new scalable interconnection network topology, called Double-Loop Hypercube (DLH), is proposed. The DLH network combines the positive features of the hypercube topology, such as small diameter, high connectivity, symmetry and simple routing, and the scalability and constant node degree of a new double-loop topology. The DLH network can maintain a constant node degree regardless of the increase in the network size. The nodes of the DLH network adopt the hybrid coding combining Johnson code and Gray code. The hybrid coding scheme can make routing algorithms simple and efficient. Both unicasting and broadcasting routing algorithms are designed for the DLH network, and it is based on the hybrid coding scheme. A detailed analysis shows that the DLH network is a better interconnection network in the properties of topology and the performance of communication. Moreover, it also adopts a threedimensional optical design methodology based on free-space optics. The optical implementation has totally spaceinvariant connection patterns at every node, which enables the DLH to be highly amenable to optical implementation using simple and efficient large space-bandwidth product space-invariant optical elements.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["489"]}

One of the main features of RUP is that it is use-case driven and supports iterative development more explicit than other process models, such as the waterfall model. Object-orientation also supports better and more explicitly incremental programming than the traditional imperative programming.

{"title": "Myopia: a collagen disease?\n", "abstract": " Myopia is an increasingly important public health problem in the world. Even though previous studies have strongly implicated a role of certain environmental factors such as visual near-work in myopia development, the pathogenesis of this disease still remains unclear. There is evidence showing that myopia is primarily a hereditary condition, combined with or without environmental influence or individual habitual factors. Recent research suggests that collagens in the sclera play an important role in the development of myopia. Based on a literature review after a Medline search on articles on myopia, changes in scleral collagen appeared to underlie or be associated with the pathogenetic factors (including inheritance) involved in myopia development. Therefore, we hypothesized that myopia is a disorder, in which alterations of scleral collagens may be responsible for the pathological changes found in it.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["489"]}

In order to optimize the boundary accuracy, based on the continuity of the mapping from joint space to workspace, by generating new random joint values in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the existed random joint values corresponding to the boundary points extracted before, new random points in workspace were generated, which distributed around the corresponding old boundary points. Then, from the newly generated points, more accurate boundary points could be extracted. The approach demonstrated to be effective to improve the boundary precision.

The main idea is: - to specify requirements and design in DC (Duration Calculus, an extension of real-time, interval logic); - to define satisfaction probabilities for formulas in this calculus; - to establish a basic probabilistic calculus, PC, with rules that support calculation of the satisfaction probability for a composite formula from probabilities of its constituents; - to develop a collection of theorems expressing specific important PC formulas in terms of the probability matrices used in classical reliability engineering. These theorems are oriented towards systematic numerical calculations. This ensures that reasoning about probabilities is consistent with requirements and design decisions.

The models can be made relatively detailed such that they can serve directly as blueprints for engineering, and yet be amenable to exhaustive verification. The approach is illustrated with a design of a triple modular fault-tolerant system that is a real case we received from our collaborators in the aerospace field.

{"title": "Fault-tolerant programming by transformations\n", "abstract": " It has been usual to consider that the steps of program refinement start with a program specification and end with the production of the text of an executable program. But for fault-tolerance, the program must be capable of taking account of the failure modes of the particular architecture on which it is to be executed. In this thesis we shall develop a formal framework which shows how a program constructed for a fault-free system can be transformed into a fault-tolerant program for execution on a system which susceptible to failures.Physical faults are modelled by a set of atomic actions whose semantics are defined in the same way as the semantics of usual program actions. The interference of fault actions on the execution of a program is then defined by the failure semantics. The behaviours of the program on a system with the specified set of fault actions are simulated by afault transformationof the program into itsfault-affected version. The properties of such a behaviour (called the fault properties) are studied by reasoning about the fault-affected version.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Privacy preserving point-of-interest recommendation using decentralized matrix factorization\n", "abstract": " Points of interest (POI) recommendation has been drawn much attention recently due to the increasing popularity of location-based networks, eg, Foursquare and Yelp. Among the existing approaches to POI recommendation, Matrix Factorization (MF) based techniques have proven to be effective. However, existing MF approaches suffer from two major problems:(1) Expensive computations and storages due to the centralized model training mechanism: the centralized learners have to maintain the whole user-item rating matrix, and potentially huge low rank matrices.(2) Privacy issues: the users' preferences are at risk of leaking to malicious attackers via the centralized learner. To solve these, we present a Decentralized MF (DMF) framework for POI recommendation. Specifically, instead of maintaining all the low rank matrices and sensitive rating data for training, we propose a random walk based decentralized training technique to train MF models on each user's end, eg, cell phone and Pad. By doing so, the ratings of each user are still kept on one's own hand, and moreover, decentralized learning can be taken as distributed learning with multi-learners (users), and thus alleviates the computation and storage issue. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that, comparing with the classic and state-of-the-art latent factor models, DMF significantly improvements the recommendation performance in terms of precision and recall.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["489"]}

In stamens, HYL1 and miR165/6 expression are progressively restricted to the lateral region, microsporangia, microspore mother cells, and microspores, whereas HD-ZIP III genes are preferentially expressed in the middle region, vascular bundle, and stomium.

The alloys were annealed at 1173\u00a0K for different time, and the results of Rietveld refinement for the XRD data showed that the alloys were composed of Gd2Co7-type, Ce2Ni7-type, Pr5Co19-type, PuNi3-type, LaNi5-type and MgCu4Sn-type phases. Lengthening annealing time obviously promoted the formation of Gd2Co7-type phase which possessed high hydrogen storage capacity, and the largest content of Gd2Co7-type phase was obtained when the alloys were annealed for 20\u00a0h. The maximum discharge capacity increased from 365.0 (as-cast) to 389.6\u00a0mAh/g (annealed for 20\u00a0h), which was ascribed to Gd2Co7-type phase abundance increasing from 35% (as-cast) to a maximum (81.71%, annealed for 20\u00a0h).

By determining the major and trace elements concentrations of aeolian sands in three grain size fractions from the central and western parts of the Hunshandake Sandy Land, we systematically study the provenance and the depositional history of aeolian sands in this desert environment. Our results show that aeolian sands from the Hunshandake Sandy Land are enriched in SiO2 and are depleted in many other elements compared to those of the Upper Continent Crust (UCC). Variations of the immobile elements ratios like Zr/Hf, La/Yb, Th/Nb, La/Nb, LaN/YbN, GdN/YbN are relatively large in the coarse and medium fractions but minor in the fine fractions. Eu anomalies are quite different in the coarse fractions, but mostly positive in the medium fractions and all negative in the fine fractions. Decreasing tendency of Zr concentrations from the west to the east in the Hunshandake Sandy Land is evident in the coarse sands but rather weak in the fine grain size fractions. Our geochemical data indicate that the sources for the coarse and medium fractions of aeolian sands are diverse, influenced by local geology and geomorphology, while the fine sand fractions are more homogenous due to intensive mixture mainly by aeolian processes.

Herein, the memory-enhancing effects of the crude extract of Polygala tenuifolia (EPT) on normal aged mice were assessed by Morris water maze (MWM) and step-down passive avoidance tests.

Natural reproduction of dove tree is extremely difficult due to its low fecundity. Serious seed abortion is one of the key factors restraining its sexual reproduction. Understanding the inducements of seed abortion is critical for addressing the issue of offspring production and the survivability of such an endangered species. However, studies on the molecular mechanism of seed abortion in woody plants are lacking, and the dearth of genomic resources for dove tree restricts further research. In this study, using the Illumina platform, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing of the fruit and seed in dove tree. A total of 149,099 transcripts were isolated and then assembled into 72,885 unigenes. Subsequently, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and abortive seeds were screened. Genes involved in response to stress, hormone signal transduction, programmed cell death, lignin biosynthesis, and secondary cell wall biogenesis showed significant different expression levels between normal and abortive seeds. Combined results indicated that the abortive seeds were under the adversity stress, which should be controlled by the maternal plant. Maternally controlled development of integument is assumed to be a critical process for abortion regulation. MYB and WRKY transcription factors, receptor kinase and laccase are considered to be important regulators in seed abortion.

Several forms of CMT have been identified arising from different genomic abnormalities such as CMT1 including CMT1A, CMT1B, and CMTX. CMT1 with associated peripheral nervous system (PNS) demyelination, the most frequent diagnosis, demonstrates slowed nerve conduction velocities and segmental demyelination upon nerve biopsy. One of its subtypes, CMT1A, presents a 1.5-Mb duplication in the p11-p12 region of the human chromosome 17 which encodes peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). CMT1B, a less common form, arises from the mutations in the myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene on chromosome 1, region q22-q23, which encodes the major structural component of the peripheral myelin. A rare type of CMT1 has been found recently and is caused by point mutations in early growth response gene 2 (EGR2), encoding a zinc finger transcription factor in Schwann cells. In addition, CMTX, an X-linked form of CMT, arises from a mutation in the connexin-32 gene. Myelin protein zero, associated with CMT1B, is a transmembrane protein of 219 amino acid residues.

Functionality is specified in rCOS pre-/post-conditions based on UTP. Provably correct refinement steps transform the Requirements Model into a component-based Design Model. Consistency of the different views is ensured, for example by checking that the State Diagram accepts the protocol specified in the Sequence Diagram. For component composition, protocol compatibility is verified. To that end, either third party tools like the FDR2 model checker are invoked, or annotations to code skeletons for additional tools like the Java Modeling Language (JML) are generated.

{"title": "Verification, refinement and scheduling of real-time programs\n", "abstract": " A real-time program can be developed by refining a specification into program code. Verification of the timing properties of the program is then usually done at two levels: verification of the ordering of timed actions in the program and proof that execution of the program on a specific system will meet its timing requirements. Refinement is done within a formal model but the second step requires a different framework in which scheduling theory analysis is used and actual program execution times can be taken into account. The implementation of a program on a system is said to be feasible or schedulable if it will meet all the timing deadlines.This paper shows how the feasibility of scheduling a real-time program can also be proved as a step in the refinement of the program from its specification. Verification of this step of refinement makes use of methods from scheduling theory within a formal system development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["489"]}

Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) overproduction plays important roles in stone formation and recurrence of hepatolithiasis. We aim to investigate the involved mechanism and the potential target to block this process. Methods. 42 bile duct samples from hepatolithiasis and 15 normal bile duct samples from hemangioma patients were collected for detecting MUC5AC expression by immunohistochemistry. MUC5AC and phosphoepidermal growth factor receptor (pEGFR) expressions in human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBECs) cultured with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were detected by real-time PCR and western blot analysis. Transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1) secretion in HIBECs was detected by ELISA. Results. MUC5AC was overexpressed in bile ducts of hepatolithiasis samples compared with bile ducts from hemangioma samples. LPS upregulated MUC5AC expression in HIBECs. LPS promoted EGFR activation, and inhibiting EGFR activation by AG1478 significantly decreased LPS-induced MUC5AC overexpression in HIBECs. Moreover, LPS increased TGF-\u03b1 secretion, and inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE), which has been implicated in ectodomain cleavage of TGF-\u03b1, significantly inhibited LPS-induced EGFR activation and subsequent MUC5AC overexpression in HIBECs.

We use the formalism of component-based timed-arc Petri Nets (CTAPN) for modular modelling of collaborative healthcare workflows and demonstrate how the model checker TAPAAL supports the verification of their functional and non-functional requirements. To this end, we use CTAPN to define the semantics of the healthcare domain specific graphical notation Little-JIL, extended with timing constrains, and apply it to the case study of blood transfusion. The value added in general, and to Little-JIL in particular, is the formal support for modelling, analysis and verification\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["489"]}

A program is called fault tolerant if its fault-affected version satisfies its specification. Verification of fault-tolerance thus requires proof of this satisfaction. For asynchronous communicating systems, fault-tolerance is provided using transformations to add checkpointing actions and recovery actions to a non-fault-tolerant program, so that the fault-affected version of this transformed program will then satisfy a required specification.

A species of Myxobolus infecting the gills was morphologically identified as Myxobolus voremkhai (Akhmerov, 1960) and it was characterised here with additional morphological and molecular data. The other species of Myxobolus infecting the host\u2019s skin did not conform to any known myxosporean species. It is characterised by the presence of round, black or milky white plasmodia with black spots. Myxospores are pyriform in frontal view and lemon-shaped in lateral view, measuring 12.9\u201316.2 \u03bcm (14.6\u00b10.7 \u03bcm) in length, 8.1\u201310.8 \u03bcm (9.4\u00b10.5 \u03bcm) in width, and 6.1\u20138.1 \u03bcm (7.0\u00b10.4 \u03bcm) in thickness.

{"title": "Biological pH sensing based on the environmentally friendly Raman technique through a polyaniline probe\n", "abstract": " The biological pH plays an important role in various cellular processes. In this work, a novel strategy is reported for biological pH sensing by using Raman spectroscopy and polyaniline nanoparticles (PANI NPs) as the pH-sensitive Raman probe. It is found that the Raman spectrum of PANI NPs is strongly dependent on the pH value. The intensities of Raman spectral bands at 1225 and 1454\u00a0cm\u22121 increase obviously with pH value varying from 5.5 to 8.0, which covers the range of regular biological pH variation. The pH-dependent Raman performance of PANI NPs, as well as their robust Raman signals and sensitivities to pH, was well retained after the nanoparticles incorporated into living 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma cells. The data indicate that such PANI NPs can be used as an effective biological pH sensor.

Firstly, an efficient algorithm to calculate the fractal dimension of a small area was proposed. By utilizing a tree array as data structure and taking the advantage of calculated information, the result could be obtained in the time of O (logN). Then, through calculating the fractal dimension of each horizontal line in the infrared cloud image, the fractal dimension that exceeds a certain threshold area was identified as the cloud area. Finally, the segmentation result was gotten through combining all the high dimensions of each horizontal line. The result demonstrates that this method solves the problems of complexity and inefficiency of the traditional methods based on fractal dimension, and the computing time remains less than 0.1 s for a large image of 640 pixel\u00d7 480 pixel. The algorithm can effectively separate the clouds from the other artificial objects, changed background light, and the local noise to obtain good segmentation results.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["489"]}

A key requirement in service-oriented design is the dependability of service. It stipulates that the behavior of services is controllable. Formal models can aid in constructing software in a dependable manner. They can describe services precisely and compose them together consistently. This paper presents a strategy for service realization based on a novel layered formal model. When a service is provided or required via internet, the semantic consistency becomes critical issue. Our architecture tackles the issue by proposing a novel scheme: defining contract of a service to keep semantic information. Although service-oriented design is our prime target, the contract models, to a large extent, are independent of the framework of design and therefore applicable to large scale software design in general.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["489"]}

The lower final cell density and faster cell density decrease rate of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 than those of C. acetobutylicum lyc::int(72) indicates that CA_C0554 was an important but not the sole autolysin-coding gene responding for the large-scale autolysis. Similar glucose utilization and solvents production but obvious lower cell density of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 comparing to C. acetobutylicum lyc::int(72) suggests that lysed C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 cells were metabolic inactive. On the contrary, the spore density of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 is 26.1% higher than that of C. acetobutylicum lyc::int(72) in the final culture broth of batch fermentation. We speculated that spontaneous autolysis of metabolic-inactive cells provided nutrients for the sporulating cells. The present study suggests that one important biological role of spontaneous large-scale autolysis in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 batch fermentation is contributing to generation of more spores during sporulation.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["489"]}

In this paper we use a physics-based global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) to examine contributions of different terms to this balance. We calculate the total pressure, as well as thermal and magnetic pressures just inside and just outside the magnetopause. Our results show that (1) the total pressure just outside the magnetopause is enhanced with the increasing of B Z in both northward and southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). For southward IMF the thermal pressure is dominant in the total pressure while the magnetic pressure is dominant for northward IMF when B Z is not small (B Z> 5 nT). For southward IMF larger solar wind dynamic pressure further enhances thermal pressure near the magnetopause while for northward IMF the dynamic pressure is more effectively converted to the magnetic\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["489"]}

However, the complexity of certain basic functions still seems elusive especially in the privatecoin SMP model. In particular, an exponential gap exists between quantum upper and lower bounds for deciding whether x and y have Hamming distance at least d, despite the sequence of related efforts [GKdW04, HSZZ06, ZS09] since Yao asked it as an open question [Yao03]. In this paper we resolve this question by providing optimal randomized and quantum protocols. We then apply the result and show efficient protocols for all symmetric XOR functions and linear threshold functions, answering an open question in [LLZ11] and another in [MO10]. Finally, we consider matrix functions and show upper bounds for the matrix rank decision problem; the public-coin classical SMP result matches the quantum two-way lower bound in [SW12]. Motivated from data sketching applications, we aim at efficiency of computation as well as communication. Our protocols for matrix rank decision are computationally efficient in the classical setting, and other protocols are computationally efficient if Alice and Bob have quantum computers.

This result suggests that the desolvation of the HIV-1 protease active site is an important step of protease-ligand complex formation as well as drug resistance. Therefore, desolvation energy could be considered as a parameter in the evaluation of future HIV-1 protease inhibitor candidates. View Full-Text", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Unifying proof methodologies of duration calculus and timed linear temporal logic\n", "abstract": " Linear temporal logic (LTL) has been widely used for specification and verification of reactive systems. Its standard model is sequences of states (or state transitions), and formulas describe sequencing of state transitions. When LTL is used to model real-time systems, a state is extended with a time stamp to record when a state transition takes place. Duration calculus (DC) is another well studied approach for real-time systems development. DC models behaviours of a system by functions from the domain of reals representing time to the system states. This paper extends this time domain to the Cartesian product of the real and the natural numbers. With the extended time domain, we provide the chop modality with a non-overlapping interpretation. This allows some linear temporal operators explicitly dealing with the discrete dimension of time to be derivable from the chop modality in essentially the same way\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["489"]}

Existing robustness verification approaches rely on computing the over-approximation of the output set, and can hardly scale up to practical CDNNs, as the result of error accumulation accompanied with approximation. In this paper, we develop a novel method for robustness verification of CDNNs with sigmoid activation functions. It converts the robustness verification problem into an equivalent problem of inspecting the most suspected point in the input region which constitutes a nonlinear optimization problem. To make it amenable, by relaxing the nonlinear constraints into the linear inclusions, it is further refined as a linear programming problem.

Methods Our randomized controlled trial investigated 170 patients with 1:1:1 allocation to two doses of 10-mg/kg intravenous TXA, 3-g topical TXA, and topical placebo of 60-ml physiological saline groups. The primary outcome, total blood loss, was calculated with Nadler and Gross formula. The secondary outcomes included allogeneic blood transfusion requirement, drain blood loss, decreased hemoglobin level. Noninferiority would be established when the upper limit 95% CI is lower than 250 ml of the noninferiority margin for the mean difference of total blood loss between topical and intravenous TXA. Thromboembolic complication incidence was considered as a safety outcome.

This corrosion seriously degrades the electrical and mechanical performance as well as the reliability of MEMS devices. In this method, a photoresist (PR) is employed to cover the noble metal, which is electrically coupled with the underlying polysilicon layer. This PR cover can effectually prevent an HF-based solution from diffusing through and arriving at the surface of the noble metal, thus cutting off the electrical current of the electrochemical corrosion reaction. The polysilicon is well protected for longer than 80 min in 49% concentrated HF solutions by a 3 \u00b5m-thick AZ 6130 PR film.

METHODS: We cloned cbh1 and its full-length cDNA from Penicillium decumbens 114-2 by the modified thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR) and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The total length of cbh1 was 1500 bp. It contained 2 introns and encoded 453 amino acids (GenBank Accession No. EF397602). The upstream sequence (1.9 kb) of cbh1 gene was also cloned and sequenced. It contained two putative binding sites for the carbon catabolite repressor CRE I and two putative binding sites for cellulases transcriptional regulator ACE I. CONCLUSION: The derepressed strain JU-A10 was a multiple mutant of the wild strain 114-2. The mutant produced several times more cellobiohydrolase activity per ml of culture medium when compared with 114-2. The cbh1 gene sequence of the mutant was the same with the wild strain. While four single base mutations were detected on the upstream sequences (1.9 kb) of cbh1 gene. The result suggests that the evidently enhanced cellobiohydrolase activity of the mutant is not due to cbh1 protein-coded sequence. The true reason maybe refer to single base mutations of the upstream sequence that effect the transcription regulation of mutant JU-A10.

A coordination of a number of components is defined as a constraint on the behaviour of the components. Such a coordination can be realised by synchronising the components with the behaviour of an active entity which we call a process. Like a component, a process can be specified by a contract. However, a process and a component can only be composed by the CSP-like synchronisation parallel composition. In addition to coordinating the behaviour of components, a process can be used to glue a number of components to form a new component. The main theoretical result is the integration of the event-based method and the state-based method. The integration leads to the fact that components glued together by a process form a component, and the black-box specification of new component can be calculated from the behaviour of the components and the process.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["489"]}

Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been proposed as a promising solution to complex SoC communication problems and has been widely accepted by academe and industry. Focusing on decreasing node degrees, reducing links and reusing router nodes, a regular NoC architecture, named Double-Loop (DL (2m)) interconnection network, is proposed. The topology of DL (2m) is simple, symmetric and scalable in architecture, and it is 3-regular plane graph with 4m nodes. The nodes of DL (2m) adopt Johnson coding scheme that can make the design of routing algorithms simple and efficient. The DL (2m) was compared with Ring and 2D Mesh by simulating and analysing, both under uniform load and under more realistic load assumptions in the several network size scenarios. The results show that the DL (2m) topology is a good trade-off between performance and cost, and it is a better NoC topology when there are not too many network nodes.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["489"]}

Based on the stratigraphic age model, a 48 ka record for paleoenvironmental change was retrieved. The results show that, the composition of sediments is dominated by terrigenous matter. In general, the concentrations of major and minor elements (Al, K, Fe, Mg, Na, Ti, Th, Sc, Rb, Sr, Cr, Co, Hf, Zr) are less than average shale. REE total abundances (\u03a3REE) which are closed to those reported previously for the Yangtze, Yellow River, and Chinese Loess, but are much higher than the upper crust composition of Japan Island, range between 80 and 213 \u03bcg/g. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns with distinct negative Eu (0.6~ 0.8) anomalies and a strong light-REE enrichment were seen throughout the data. Cerium anomaly is not distinct. Elemental ratios and La/Th-Hf discrimination diagram of source rocks show that sediments in the study area mainly originate from upper crust and the parent rocks are feldspar-quartzose. During 11~ 18 ka, the abundances of major, minor, and rare earth elements are different from those during 0~ 11 ka and 18~ 48 ka. The factors controlling the elements distributions are related to sea-level and climate changes. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA)(45~ 61) indicates that the intensity of chemical weathering in the sediment source is weak. The weathering intensity is much higher after 18ka, indicating climate changes from cold and dry to warm and wet conditions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Double-loop hypercube: a new scalable interconnection network for massively parallel computing\n", "abstract": " An important issue in the design of interconnection networks for massively parallel computers is scalability. A new scalable interconnection network topology, called double-loop hypercube (DLH), is proposed. The DLH network combines the positive features of hypercube topology, such as small diameter, high connectivity, symmetry and simple routing, and the scalability and constant node degree of a new double-loop topology. The DLH network can maintain a constant node degree regardless of the increase in the network size. The nodes of the DLH network adopt the hybrid coding combining Johnson code and Gray code. The hybrid coding scheme can make routing algorithms simple and efficient. Both unicasting and broadcasting routing algorithms are designed for the DLH network, and it is based on the hybrid coding scheme.

A UML system requirements model consists of a use-case model and a conceptual class model. Generally, a use case is either described as a system operation which can be defined as a pair of pre and post conditions in the context of the conceptual class model, or described as a sequence of such system operations. AutoPA2.0 can transform the descriptions of use cases into an executable prototype in Java. The execution of each use case is a sequence of basic atomic actions which first check the pre-condition and then enforce the post-condition of the corresponding use case.

Specifically, an adversary may participate in the MTL process through one task and thereby acquire the model information for another task. The previously proposed privacy-preserving MTL methods protect data instances rather than models, and some of them may underperform in comparison with STL methods.

However, we cannot sample out OOD data from the model. This counterintuitive phenomenon has not been satisfactorily explained. In this paper, we prove theorems to investigate the divergences in flow-based model and give two explanations to the above phenomenon from divergence and geometric perspectives, respectively. Based on our analysis, we propose two group anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, we decompose the KL divergence and propose a point-wise anomaly detection method. We have conducted extensive experiments on prevalent benchmarks to evaluate our methods. For group anomaly detection (GAD), our method can achieve near 100\\% AUROC on all problems and has robustness against data manipulations. On the contrary, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) GAD method performs not better than random guessing for challenging problems and can be attacked by data manipulation in almost all cases. For point-wise anomaly detection (PAD), our method is comparable to the SOTA PAD method on one category of problems and outperforms the baseline significantly on another category of problems.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["489"]}

Our present data indicated that compared with the GA-treated seeds, the soluble sugars were more quickly consumed and lipid breakdown was prematurely and actively initiated in the water-treated seeds during the early germination. However, the application of sucrose could improve the germination of water-treated seeds and significantly inhibit lipid breakdown.

A comprehensive understanding of the interaction between NDV and its host is therefore critical for control of this disease. Previously, we found that chicken ISG12(1) was among the significantly upregulated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in embryos and the bursa of Fabricius of chickens infected by NDV, based on transcriptome sequencing. However, its antiviral effects and function were poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of chicken ISG12(1) on NDV replication. First, we confirmed that NDV infection stimulated high level expression of chicken ISG12(1) in vivo and in vitro based on RT-qPCR. Next, through overexpression and knockdown experiments, the antiviral activity of ISG12(1) was investigated.

The European Commission\u2019s Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) is one such dataset with historical layers corresponding to the epochs of 2014, 2000, 1990, and 1975. We assess the accuracy of the GHSL landcover classification for the circa 2014 period, as well as the accuracy of the Atlas of Urban Expansion land cover classifications for the circa 2014 period, using reference map data that was manually digitized from high resolution satellite imagery in 200 global cities. We apply the urban extent methodology developed in Atlas of Urban Expansion to create GHSL urban extents and compare them to Atlas of Urban Expansion extents at the 1990, 2000, and 2014 time periods. The overall accuracies of the two datasets are essentially the same, never more than one percentage point apart. Urban extents created with GHSL data were smaller than Atlas extents in 2014, but larger in 2000 and 1990.

{"title": "A vibration-based approach for stator winding fault diagnosis of induction motors: application of envelope analysis\n", "abstract": " Induction motors are usually considered as one of the key components in various applications. To maintain the availability of induction motors, it calls for a reliable condition monitoring and prognostics strategy. Among the common induction motor faults, stator winding faults are usually diagnosed with current and voltage signals. However, if the same performance can be achieved, the use of vibration signal is favorable because the winding fault diagnostic method can be integrated with bearing fault diagnostic method which has been successfully proven with vibration signal. Existing work concerning vibration for winding faults often takes it either as auxiliary to magnetic flux, or is not able to detect the winding faults unless severity is already quite significant. This paper proposes a winding fault diagnostic method based on vibration signals measured on the mechanical structure of an induction motor. In order to identify the signature of faults, time synchronous averaging was firstly applied on the raw vibration signals to remove discrete frequency components originating from the dynamics of the shaft and/or gears, and the spectral kurtosis filtering was subsequently applied on the residual signal to emphasize the impulsiveness. For the purpose of enhancing the residual signal in practice, a demodulation technique was implemented with the help of kurtogram. A series of experiments have been conducted on a three-phase induction motor test bed, where stator inter-turn faults can be easily simulated at different loads, speeds and severity levels.

In this paper, we present the initial version AutoPA1. 0 that implements the transformations from UML system requirement models to executable prototypes. An UML system requirement consists of a use-case model and a conceptual class model. Each use case is either described as a pair of pre and post conditions in the context of the conceptual model or represented as an activity diagram drawn in MagicDraw9. 5 by the user. AutoPA can transform an activity diagram into the Java code of the prototype for execution. For a use case specified in terms of its pre and post conditions, AuoPA1. 0 first transforms the specification into a sequence of atomic actions to generate a corresponding activity diagram.

Some authors have shown that the fewer the plasmids, the more efficient reverse genetics is for segmented RNA virus. However, it is not clear if the same applies for (\u2212)ssRNA, such as Newcastle disease virus (NDV).

{"title": "Automated Submicroliter Fluid Dispensing technology for Protein Crystallization\n", "abstract": " Recently, high-throughput protein crystallization requires that the volumes of sample solution in crystallization experiments should be reduced to increase the screening chance with a given amount of sample. This led to the developments of automated liquid-handling instruments that can transfer submicroliter volumes of fluid. In this paper, many kinds of submicroliter fluid-dispensing methodologies and the characteristics and applicability have been expounded. And the rules for selecting appropriate submicroliter fluid-dispensing methodologies in protein crystallization was brought forward. In order to ensure dispensing accurately, reproducibility and reliability for liquid handling in the submicroliter range on protein crystallization, a non-contact solenoid based dispensing system was developed and the dispensing process was investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The dispensing process is a function of the fluid properties and the system parameters such as the pressure, nozzle geometry and the details of the actuation motion. Physical arguments show that this functional dependence can be reduced to two dimensionless numbers: the Weber number which represents the ratio of inertia to surface tension forces, and the Reynolds number which represents the ratio of inertia to viscous forces. A parametric study indicates that there is an optimal regime for the dispensing process in which a drop forms and finally the breakup happens. Finally, the CFD model was verified experimentally by comparing the non-contact fluid dispense behaviour with photographs of a dispense process.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["489"]}

METHODS: Competitive binding assay of [3H] ohmefentanyl was used to reveal the affinity for \u00b5-opioid receptor in Sf9-\u00b5 cells.[3H] cAMP RIA was used to determine cAMP level. Antinociceptive activity was evaluated using 55 \u00baC mouse hot plate test. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal jumping was used to reflect physical dependence in mice. RESULTS: All drugs displayed antinociceptive activity and produced physical dependence in mice. The Ki values of dihydroetorphine, fentanyl, heroin, and pethidine in competitive binding assay were (0.85\u00b10.20) nmol,(59.1\u00b111.7) nmol,(0.36\u00b10.13) \u00b5mol, and (12.2\u00b13.8) \u00b5mol respectively.

After chronic pretreatment with these drugs, naloxone induced cAMP withdrawal overshoot in Sf9-\u00b5 cells. The dependence index in Sf9-\u00b5 cells was calculated as Ki value in competitive binding assay over EC50 value in naloxone-precipitated cAMP assay. The physical dependence index in mice was calculated as antinociceptive ED50/withdrawal jumping cumulative ED50.

However, more details need to be uncovered to facilitate a fundamental understanding of NIR-II PTT.

The photothermal conversion capabilities of MoO2 in the NIR-I and II regions were investigated step by step, from a simple tissue phantom to a three-dimensional cellular system, and further to a tumor-bearing animal model. NIR-II laser exhibited a lower photothermal attenuation coefficient (0.541 at 1064\u2005nm) in a tissue phantom compared with its counterpart (0.959 at 808\u2005nm), which allows it to be more capable of deep-tissue PTT in vitro and in vivo.

In this paper, we present an approach to integrate a formal method to practical component-based model driven development through defining a UML profile that maps the concepts of the formal method as UML stereotypes, and implementing the profile into a CASE tool. Unlike most of the previous works in this vein, which concentrate on verifying the correctness of the models built in the development process, we focus on how the full development process can be driven by applying the refinement rules of the formal method in an incremental and interactive manner. The formal method we adopt in this work is the refinement for Component and Object Systems (rCOS). We demonstrate the development\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["489"]}

We propose an openEHR-based solution, called Light-weight Electronic Traceable and Updatable System (LETUS), which aims at increasing childhood immunization coverage and traceability. Two key modules of the solution include:(1) a service that collects the data from the immunization workers, computes population estimates for particular regions, and creates alerts if the ratio of vaccinations over population in a region falls outside a certain range (over or under), and (2) several\" thin client\" modules where workers can enter their collected data and receive feedback about the current coverage in their region. The proposed software system can be integrated into existing regional immunization registry systems, and run on the servers of a local health agency to ensure timely reporting. Within each immunization registry systems, children data is sharable by applying openEHR approach. This solution will gradually replace the current record keeping process by employing smart phone applications and web services.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["489"]}

However, for a 5-DOF robot manipulator, because of the uncontrolable and uncertain orientation vectors, it's difficult to analytically express all joint variables by one of them, therefore one-dimensional iterative method can not be directedly used. By adding an appropriate virtual joint to it, a 5-DOF manipulator can be changed into a 6-DOF one so that the uncertain orientation vectors can be pre-given, and the difficulty is solved.

{"title": "Electromechanical resonance behavior of suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes under high bias voltages\n", "abstract": " We characterize the nanoelectromechanical response of suspended individual carbon nanotubes under high voltage biases. An abrupt upshift in the mechanical resonance frequency of approximately 3 MHz is observed at high bias. While several possible mechanisms are discussed, this upshift is attributed to the onset of optical phonon emission, which results in a sudden contraction of the nanotube due to its negative thermal expansion coefficient. This, in turn, causes an increase in the tension in the suspended nanotube, which upshifts its mechanical resonance frequency. This upshift is consistent with Raman spectral measurements, which show a sudden downshift of the optical phonon modes at high bias voltages. Using a simple model for oscillations on a string, we estimate the effective change in the length of the nanotube to be \u0394L/L\u2248\u2212 2\u00d7 10\u2212 5 at a bias voltage of 1 V.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["489"]}

METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of erythromycin, clindamycin, penicillin and fluoroquinolones against 192 strains of S. pneumoniae was tested with broth microdilution method according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of 148 clinical isolates of erythromycin resistant S. pneumoniae, the macrolide resistance phenotypes were observed by the erythromycin-clindamycin-spiramycin triple-disc test and erythromycin resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: 42.7% S. pneumoniae isolates was resistant (intermediate and resistant) to penicillin while the resistance rates to erythromycin and clindamycin were 77.6% and 66.7% respectively. The ermB gene, being the most prevalent, was detected in 79.1% of the 148 erythromycin-resistant strains. The main phenotype (85.1%) of erythromycin-resistant strains was constitutive macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B resistance phenotype (cMLS). Erythromycin MICs for S. pneumoniae ermB-positive isolates were higher than those for mefA-positive isolates. 74.4% of the ermB-positive isolates demonstrated erythromycin MICs of> 16.0 micro g/ml, and the erythromycin MICs for mefA-positive isolates ranged from 0.5 approximately 4.0 micro g/ml.

The results showed that the regrowth ability of A. frigida under proportional clipping was superior to that under stubble clipping, and light clipping (1/4 proportional clipping or 10 cm stubble clipping) was superior to no clipping. In early growth season, the net regrowth of A. frigida was higher under no clipping than under light clipping, but reversed in late growth season (after mid-August). The biomass allocation pattern of A. frigida was roots> leaves> stems. Grazing or clipping affected biomass allocation significantly, especially for the allocation of leaves and flowers. The biomass allocation of leaves was significantly higher under 3/4 proportional clipping or 4 cm stubble clipping than under other treatments, and reverse trend was true for the biomass allocation of flowers. There were no significant differences in biomass allocation of roots and stems among treatments.

The virulence of NDV is mainly determined by the cleavage site of F protein.

In contrast, this proportion remains unchanged if NDV is passaged via 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos. This information suggests that environmental conditions rather than mutation affect NDV fitness in quasispecies.

The \u03b4D and \u03b418O values of plant water, rain water, ground water and soil water were determined, and the percentages of soil water at different depths used by plants were calculated with the IsoSource model. Our results showed that the \u03b4D and \u03b418O values of stem water were significantly different among various life forms in both habitats except for those of trees and shrubs in dune slack. From trees to grass, the depth of soil water contributed to main water source of plant became shallower in dune slack: trees and shrubs mainly used soil water in 50-150 cm or 30-50 cm layer, subshrubs mainly used soil water in 10-30 cm layer while grass relied on soil water of 0-10 cm layer. Shrubs mainly used soil water of 0-30 cm layer and subshrubs mainly used soil water around 50 cm at fixed dune. This study indicated that in dry season plants at fixed dune are more dependent on soil water of 0-50 cm layer compared with those in dune slack.

How carbon storage responds to grazing in steppes remains poorly understood. We quantified the effects of grazing on community composition and species diversity, and carbon storage in two typical grasslands of northeastern China, one in Horqin and the other one in Hulunbeier. In both grasslands, grazing did not influence plant species diversity. However, it substantially decreased above ground carbon by 31% and 54% in Horqin and Hulunbeier, respectively. Fenced and grazing treatments showed a similar belowground carbon at both locations. The predominant carbon pool in the study grassland ecosystem was found in the upper 100 cm soil depth, from 98.2 to 99.1% of the total carbon storage.

However, for transgenic pig, practically lacking a pre-breeding screening program, time, labor and money is always wasted to maintain non-transgenic pigs, low or null transgenic transmission pigs and the related fruitless gestations. Developing a pre-breeding screening program would make the transgenic herd expansion more economical and efficient. In this technical report, we proposed a three-step pre-breeding screening program for transgenic boars simply through combining the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay with the common pre-breeding screening workflow. In the first step of screening, combined with general transgenic phenotype analysis, FISH is used to identify transgenic boars.

{"title": "Screening for prodromes of chemotherapy-induced vomiting and correlation between prodromes and chemotherapy-induced vomiting in lung cancer patients\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To explore prodromes of chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV) and their association with CIV in lung cancer patients. METHODS: The prodromes of CIV in 250 lung cancer patients were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to determine the symptoms most likely correlated with CIV. One hundred fifty-seven patients received medical interventions. The development of correlative symptoms and occurrence of CIV between the intervention and non-intervention groups was analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 250 patients with the prodromes of CIV, the incidence rate of CIV was 67.2%. Logistic regression indicated that nausea, constipation, insomnia, hiccups, anorexia, and history of drinking were correlated with CIV (P< 0.05 for all). Among the 20 symptoms observed in this study, the incidence rates of relatively common symptoms were nausea (72.0%), anorexia (68.4%), taste changes (48.8%), constipation (45.6%), abdominal distension (45.6%), stomach distension (40.4%), and insomnia (40.0%). The incidence rats of all symptoms except hiccups before and after intervention had significant difference (P< 0.05 for all). The incidence rates of CIV were 30.0% in the intervention group and 50.6% in the non-intervention group, with a significant difference between the two groups (P= 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Prodromes of CIV are closely related to the occurrence of CIV. Timely intervention for prodromes of CIV can reduce the incidence rate of CIV during chemotherapy in lung cancer patients.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["489"]}

This paper focuses on the development of a winding fault diagnosis method using 3-phase current and voltage signals. To conduct this study, an induction motor test-bed was developed and constructed. One of the most difficult insulation faults to detect, namely interturn fault, was induced in the motor under three different severity levels. A number of experiments were carried out under different operating regimes, comprising both healthy and faulty states. Two on-line winding fault detection techniques including (i) negative impedance and (ii) voltage mismatch detector have been implemented to develop an early fault detection scheme for stator winding insulation of an induction motor powered by a frequency-inverter drive (ie controller). In order to remove the effect of pulse-width modulation (PWM) caused by such a drive mainly on the voltage signals, an integration based signal processing method is proposed to demodulate 3-phase output voltage signals measured on the drive. While, a simple lowpass filtering is applied to the measured 3-phase output current signals. The integration of the proposed signal processing method along with the on-line monitoring techniques provided a robust approach capable of detecting motor\u2019s winding insulation (interturn) faults in early stages.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["489"]}

The large-scale synthetic aperture radar dataset obtained by Envisat satellite from 2007 to 2009 is collected to obtain the surface deformation characteristic of the area by SBAS-InSAR technology, and then the independence provided by the observation well is used. Using the independent water level data provided by the observation wells, combined with the vertical InSAR deformation component and the head data, the CWT method is used to separate the periodic deformation signal components and long-term trends. Finally, the isolated signal component is used to invert the elastic and inelastic storage coefficient based on the ground subsidence model. The settlement signal separation method used in this paper makes up for the shortcomings of the two kinds of information in the previous settlement signal that are difficult to separate, which allows for more accurate inversion of aquifer parameters and helps to understand the aquifer parameters and continuously manage groundwater resources.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "The shape compactness of urban extents\n", "abstract": " The shape compactness of urban extents matters, just like urban density matters. Other things being equal, both metrics determine the average travel distances in cities, and hence their energy consumption and their greenhouse gas emissions. They also affect the length of infrastructure lines and the length of commutes, and hence also labor market integration and overall productivity. In principle, therefore, increasing either the shape compactness or the density of cities can contribute\u2014in different yet equal measure\u2014to mitigating climate change. There are strong forces that push urban extents to become more compact, circular or near circular in shape, and these forces have evolved over time. There are also key forces that have pushed urban extents to become less compact over time. We introduce these key forces and illustrate their effects on particular cities. We then define a set of metrics for measuring the shape compactness of cities. We use them to measure urban extents obtained from satellite imagery in a stratified global sample of 200 cities in three time periods: 1990, 2000, and 2014. We find that the shape compactness of cities the world over is independent of city size, area, density, and income and that, not surprisingly, it is strongly affected by topography. We also find that it has declined overall between 1990 and 2014 and explain some of the sources of this decline. We conclude the paper by assessing the ways in which the shape compactness of cities can be increased to make them more productive, more inclusive, more sustainable, and more climate-resilient in decades to come.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["489"]}

In this paper, the layout, principle, structure and implementation of the back-analysis system is briefly described, and some new developments are demonstrated in details, such as the zonal modeling of crust stress field, the convergence-increment hybrid target function and variable loosening zonal model. Finally this paper shows how this system works out an optimum and adjusts the excavation and cavern supports, and the roles of back analysis in making prediction and warning to ensure the power house safety.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["489"]}
{"title": "Investigation on spheroidized microstructure of 1.41% C ultra-high carbon steel after quenching and high tempering treatment [J]\n", "abstract": " An ultra-high carbon steel containing 1.41% C (mass fraction) was spheroidized by quenching and high temperature tempering treatment. The formation mechanism of ultrafine carbides was investigated, and the optimal spheroidizing parameters were determined. The results show that the carbides are dissolved into the austenite progressively with the increase of quenching temperature in the range of 850-1 100\u2103, and thus the coarse carbides are refined. After tempering, the fine carbides are uniformly precipitated not only from acicular martensite, but also from retained austenite, thus increasing the amount of carbides. As Al and Cr elements can inhibit the growth of the carbides, the higher tempering temperature is beneficial for spheroidization in the range of 550-750\u2103. The size of carbides is in the range of 0.1-0.3 \u03bcm even though the steel was quenched at 1 100\u2103, followed by tempering at 750\u2103.[Fund]: \u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u91d1\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (50774029);; \u9655\u897f\u7701\u79d1\u6280\u653b\u5173\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (2004K07-G18);; \u9655\u897f\u7701\u6559\u80b2\u5385\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b66\u4e13\u9879\u8d44\u52a9\u9879\u76ee (07JK331)", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Learning-based image representation and method for face recognition\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a novel method for face recognition. First, we generate the new image representation from the decorrelated hybrid color configurations rather than RGB color space via a learning algorithm. The learning algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plus Fisher Linear Discriminant analysis (FLD), is able to derive the desired color transformation to generate a discriminating image representation that is optimal for face recognition. Second, we partition face image into some small patches, each of which can obtain its own color transformation, to reduce the effect of illumination variations. Thus, a patch-based novel image representation method is proposed for face recognition. Experiments on the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) version 2 Experiment 4 show that the proposed method outperforms gray-scale image and some recent methods in face recognition.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["489"]}

The type system checks whether an expression, a command or a program is type-correct, based on its class graph and type context, which is a graph too. The operational semantics is a small-step one defined in the style of classical structural operational semantics, in which an execution step of a command is defined as a transition from one state graph to another obtained by simple operations on graphs. Both the type system and the semantics are fully implemented. On the one hand, working out the implementation has helped us to understand the semantics to make sure our definition is correct. On the other hand, the implementation will be used as the basis for our future development of simulation and validation techniques for oo programs, with the visualization of stage graph transitions during the execution. The motivation of this work is the development of techniques for reasoning about properties of oo programs stated in a logic of graphs.

{"title": "Self-assembling Peptide RADA16 Nanofibre Scaffold for a Cancer Cell Three-dimensional Culture\n", "abstract": " Nanofibre structures of self-assembling peptides as biological materials have recently been studied for their promising uses in tissue engineering and biomedical research. We report here a self-assembling peptide RADA16 that forms nanofibre scaffold to be used as a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture matrix. The 16-residue peptide forms a \u03b2-sheet structure and undergoes molecular self-assembly into nanofibres and eventually into a higher-order scaffold hydrogel. In this study, we indicate that the nanofibres assemble into much stiffer scaffold networks which can mimic the tumor microenvironment in vivo more effectively. Circular dichroism spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and rheology were used to study the structure of the peptide nanofibres and the kinetics of the cell culture scaffold formation. The change of this assembly into stiffer scaffold is important for a 3D cancer cell culture. We have studied cellular behaviour of human lung cancer cell A549 within RADA16 nanofibre scaffold including morphology, growth, drug resistance, and adhesion ability to elucidate its application in cancer cell research. Different cell morphologies in a 3D scaffold and on two-dimensional (2D) plastic may be related to the enhanced drug resistance of A549 cell colonies in a 3D culture which forms a 3D gradient to mimic the in vivo conditions and modifies the cellular behaviour that are missing in 2D monolayer culture. Adhesion assay also shows that the 3D cell colonies have significantly different adhesion abilities to ECM proteins of laminin and collagen IV due to the variations of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Is glaucoma a central never system disease?\n", "abstract": " Studies on glaucoma have been focused only on optic nerve damage and aqueous humor dynamic for many years. In recent years, with the advances in understanding of glaucoma and visual sciences, and the development of a neurological cross-discipline, new interdisciplinary problems have been raised. Notably, the question of whether glaucoma is only an optic nerve disease. Is it a disease that begins from the eye, and then involves the whole visual pathway? Or is it a particular central nervous system disease, which manifests itself in the eye? The answers to these problems are inconclusive so far, but there are reasons to believe that glaucoma is a disease with multi-level, multi-factor damage to the entire visual pathway involved. Its mechanisms are complex and involve cross-synaptic damage, visual pathway blood disorders, blood-brain barrier disorders, and so on. As we come to understand that glaucoma is an ocular and central never system neurodegenerative disease, we may better understand the pathogenesis of glaucoma and therefore establish comprehensive treatment strategies for this disease.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["489"]}

The repair and maintenance for wind turbines are very expensive and time-consuming due to various reasons including logistics difficulties, distant locations, costly spare parts, and expensive labor force, etc. Prognostics and health management (PHM) technologies are of vital importance to wind turbines operation and maintenance since it can detect incipient faults in early time and predict the trend of their propagation so that the maintenance activities can be planned ahead of time to reduce the downtime and maintenance cost. Drivetrain systems are of the most concern in maintenance as they contribute the most downtime and repair costs. While there are various condition monitoring techniques available for drivetrain systems, vibration-based techniques have been most widely adopted due to its direct access to structure response and capability for early detection of incipient faults.

The protein blocked the translocation of the immediate early protein ICP0 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Target studies using an array of yeast proteins revealed that the protein binds preferentially to some yeast peroxisome proteins. An antagonist of the peroxisome proliferator nuclear receptor complex (PPAR)[2-chloro-5-nitro-(N-pyridyl) benzamide (MW 277.7)] was inhibitory to both HSV-1 and HSV-2 at EC 50 values of 5.8 and 10 \u00b5M, respectively.

{"title": "Reconstructing paths for reachable code\n", "abstract": " Infeasible code has proved to be an interesting target for static analysis. It allows modular and scalable analysis, and at the same time, can be implemented with a close-to-zero rate of false warnings. The challenge for an infeasible code detection algorithm is to find executions that cover all statements with feasible executions as fast as possible. The remaining statements are infeasible code. In this paper we propose a new encoding of programs into first-order logic formulas that allows us to query the non-existence of feasible executions of a program, and, to reconstruct a feasible path from counterexamples produced for this query. We use these paths to develop a path-cover algorithm based on blocking clauses. We evaluate our approach using several real-world applications and show that our new prover-friendly encoding yields a significant speed-up over existing approaches.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["489"]}
{"title": "Empirical prediction of simultaneous switching noise\n", "abstract": " In an example embodiment, the system obtains the mutual inductance (eg, M ij) between a quiet I/O buffer and each switching I/O buffer on a PLD from an automatic SSN measurement system. The system calculates the corrected mutual inductance between the quiet I/O buffer and each switching I/O buffer by multiplying the mutual inductance by a correction factor (eg, \u03b1 j). The system multiplies each corrected mutual inductance by the rate of current flowing through the switching I/O buffer to obtain an induced voltage resulting from the switching I/O buffer. The system sums the induced voltages for all the switching I/O buffers on the PLD to obtain an estimate of total induced voltage caused in the quiet I/O buffer by all switching I/O buffers. The correction factor is based on bench measurements and depends on the amplitude of the simultaneous switching noise affecting each switching I/O buffer.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["489"]}

This problem has been widely studied for hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model proteins, where each amino acid is classified as a hydrophobic (H) residue or a hydrophilic (or polar, P) one. By combining the genetic algorithm (GA) and the local search based on pull moves, a hybrid algorithm, called the genetic algorithm with pull moves (GA-pull moves), is proposed for the two-dimensional (2D) HP protein folding problem. To reduce the cost of the generation of the valid initial population and enhance the efficiency of the search of the GA-pull moves algorithm, a greedy strategy is employed. Eight benchmark instances with the length ranging from 20 to 64 are tested to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

METHODS: From January 2001 to January 2006, 57 patients with fibrous dysplasia of bone involving the proximal femur were treated. There were 29 males and 28 females, aging 8-50 years (mean 22 years). Thirty-five patients were involved one bone and 22 patients were involved more than two bones. According to Guille's classification, there were 34 cases of type A, 8 cases of type B, 8 cases of type C and 7 cases of type D. Fourteen cases complicated by coax varus and the neck-shaft angle of femur was 78 degrees on average (55-100 degrees). The duration of the disease was 2.3 years on average (4 months to 10 years). The choice of the various operative procedures depended on the quality of the bone and the extent of the lesion. When the quality of the bone was good, then curettage and bone-grafting was performed. When the quality of the bone was poor, curettage and bone-grafting combined with internal fixation was performed. Medial displacement valgus or valgus osteotomies were used to treat fibrous dysplasia of bone involving the proximal part of the femur with coax varus. RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 6 months to 5 years with an average of 2.8 years. All bone graft were absorbed slightly at 3 months and markedly at 10 to 14 months postoperatively. The femoral mechanical alignments were corrected completely radiologically in patients complicated by coax varus; the average neck-shaft angle was corrected from 78 degrees (55-100 degrees) preoperatively to 122 degrees (95-130 degrees\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Influence of Wetland and Farmland Changes on Runoff Depth in Naolihe River Basin\n", "abstract": " The wetland area decrease and farmland area increase are typical changes of landscape of the Naolihe River basin since 1950s. By adopting linearity, logarithm, exponential, and cubic function to simulate the correlation between the wetland area, farmland area and area precipitation and runoff depth in the basin, respectively, the results show:(1) The simulation correlation of cubic function is best;(2) The correlation between the wetland area decrease and farmland area increase and runoff depth is less than that between the precipitation and the runoff depth. By analyzing the mechanism of contribution from the wetland area decrease and farmland increase to the runoff depth decline, it is believed that the wetland area decrease reduce the\" cold-wet effect\" of wetland, and enhance the terrestrial evaporation potential; the conversion from wetland to farmland changes the redistribution processes of precipitation in soils; the farmland area increase enhances the evaporation potential of soils; the conversation from dry farmland to paddy field increase the water utilization quantities of the surface water and groundwater, which result in reducing the runoff depth. The research conclusions show that the wetland area decrease and farmland area increase makes a more obvious contribution to the runoff depth reduction. The runoff depth reduction is an indicator of a basin appearing in a drought tendency. It is supposed to strengthen the wetland conversation and restoration, especially restore the water connection relation between river and marsh wetland, control the area of paddy filed, and enhance the reservoirs' regulating wetland ecological water supply.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["489"]}

In this paper we demonstrate an andromonoecious mating system in a native perennial herb, Globba lancangensis (Zingiberaceae), found in Xishuangbanna, SW China. Firstly, we describe the floral biology of this species: pollen viabilities, fruit-set ratios, behaviors of visiting insects and so forth, and then compare the morphological differences between male and hermaphroditic flowers. Secondly, we present the results of experiments designed to determine its breeding system, and to test whether this system has a self-incompatibility mechanism. Thirdly, we show the variations of sexual expression in this species with emphasis on the change of male: hermaphrodite ratios. Finally, we discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of the variations in reproductive characteristics. Male and hermaphroditic flowers differed in several dimensions. Hermaphroditic flowers have significantly larger ovaries, longer corolla tubes, marginally wider staminodes and longer labellums.

The results show that when the particle content in the system is low (less than 0.3\u2009wt%), the hydrate formation rate is accelerated; when the particle content is high (above 2\u2009wt%), the hydrate formation rate is lowered. This phenomenon was confirmed by calculating the moles\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["489"]}

In addition, tung oil extracted from the fruit seeds is an environmentally friendly paint used widely in China. However, mutual shading inside a tung tree canopy leads to a low yield of fruit because of weak or dead lower branches. In this project, a pot experiment was conducted to understand the growth, physiological, anatomical structure, and biochemical responses of tung trees under various shading levels. Tung tree seedlings were subjected to different light intensities\u2014100% sunlight (no cover), L100; 75% sunlight (25% shading), L75; 50% sunlight (50% shading), L50; and 20% sunlight (80% shading), L20\u2014from June to August. Results indicate that the L75 treatment reduced significantly the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gS), transpiration rate (E), total aboveground and root dry weight (DW), maximum net photosynthetic rate (Amax), and maximum rate of electron transport at saturating irradiance (Jmax) compared with the control, although plant height and leaf area (LA) were not reduced. Lower light intensities (L50 and L20) and longer duration of treatment led to greater reduction in growth, leaf thickness, and photosynthetic potential (Amax and Jmax). Chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), and total chlorophyll content were increased in the L50 and L20 treatments compared with L100 and L75. There was no significant reduction in the enzyme activities of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEPC) of the seedlings using the L75 treatment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Full-Scale Label-Free Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Analysis of Mouse Brain Using a Black Phosphorus-Based Two-Dimensional Nanoprobe\n", "abstract": " The brain takes the vital role in human physiological and psychological activities. The precise understanding of the structure of the brain can supply the material basis for the psychological behavior and cognitive ability of human beings. In this study, a fast molecular fingerprint analysis of mouse brain tissue was performed using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. A nanohybrid consisting of flake-like black phosphorus (BP) and Au nanoparticles (BP-AuNSs) served as the novel SERS substrate for the spectral analysis of brain tissue. BP-AuNSs exhibited outstanding SERS activity compared to the traditional citrate-stabilized Au nanoparticles, which could be largely ascribed to the plentiful hot spots formed in the BP nanosheet. Rapid, full-scale and label-free SERS imaging of mouse brain tissue was then realized with a scanning speed of 56 ms per pixel. Fine textures and clear contour were observed in the SERS images of brain tissue, which could be well in accordance with the classical histological analysis; however, it could avoid the disadvantages in the processing procedure of tissue section. Additionally, the SERS spectra illustrated plentiful biochemical fingerprint of brain tissue, which indicated the molecular composition of various encephalic regions. The SERS difference spectrum of the left versus right hemisphere revealed the biochemical difference between the two hemispheres, which helped to uncover the psychological and cognitive models of the left and right hemispheres.

{"title": "A Mechanism study toward understanding the protective effects of glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) on light-induced retinal damage\n", "abstract": " Purpose: Glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2), located mainly in the mitochondria, is a glutathione-dependent oxidoreductase which is known to reduce S-glutathionylated proteins. In previous study, we have found that Grx2 could protect the retina from light-induced retinal degeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate mitochondrial energy production with thiol-repair processes in the damaged retina remain largely unknown. To better understand the protective effects of Grx2 in the retina, our study was thus extended to analyze the full transcriptome changes of the retinal tissue in light-exposed Grx2 knockout (KO) mice.Methods: Wild type (WT) and Grx2 KO mice were exposed to white light at 12,000 lux for 1 hour after dark adaptation. The retinal damage was confirmed by the electroretinogram (ERG) recording and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) measurement. Protein glutathionylation level was evaluated by Western Blot. We then compared the full transcriptome of the retinal tissue in WT and Grx2 KO mice by performed the whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq). The gene network was analyzed using DESeq2 pathway analysis software and the selected genes of interest were further confirmed by real-time PCR and Western Blot.Results: Light-exposed Grx2 KO mice showed compromised visual function as indicated by severe loss of both a-and b-wave amplitudes and the thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Protein glutathionylation level was elevated in light-exposed Grx2 KO mice.

That is, given properties of sites and the temporal occurrence of attacks, we are able to attribute individual attacks to joint causes and vulnerabilities, as well as estimate the evolution of these vulnerabilities over time. Specifically, we use hazard regression with a time-varying additive hazard function parameterized in a generalized linear form. The activation coefficients on each feature are continuous-time functions over time. We formulate the problem of learning these functions as a constrained variational maximum likelihood estimation problem with total variation penalty and show that the optimal solution is a th order spline (a piecewise constant function) with a finite number of adaptively chosen knots.

We first exploit a graph algebra and set up a graph model that supports graph transformations in the DPO approach.

Overexpression of Rpl32-1 inhibits cell growth while overexpression of Rpl32-2 does not. Deleting rpl32-2 impairs cell growth more severely than deleting rpl32-1 does. Cell growth impaired by deleting either paralog can be rescued completely by reintroducing rpl32-2, but only partly by rpl32-1. Overexpression of Rpl32-1 inhibits cell division, yielding 4c DNA and multiple septa, while overexpressed Rpl32-2 promotes it. Transcriptomics analysis proved that Rpl32 paralogs regulate expression of a subset of genes related with cell division and stress response in a distinctive way. This functional difference of the two paralogs is due to their difference of 95th amino acid residue.

Finally, due to the complementary characteristic between the new image representation and gray-level image, combining the classification results of multiple feature sets at the score level can improve recognition performance further.

We propose to employ a photoresist (PR) layer to cover the noble metal layer, which electrically contacts with the underlying polysilicon layer. This PR cover can prevent HF-based solution from diffusing through and arriving at the surface of the noble metal, thus cut off the electrical current of the electrochemical corrosion and thus protect the polysilicon layer intact. The polysilicon layer can be protected longer than 80 min in 49% HF solutions by 3 \u03bcm thick AZ6130 photoresist.

Methods The structure of the peptide was tested with transmission electron microscopy. The sensitivity of the cells to 5-Fu was detected by MTT assay. The adhesion experiment was employed to analyze the differences of adhesion ability for extra-cellular matrix protein (\u2163collagen, laminin, fibronectin) of cells cultured under 2D and 3D conditions. Results RADA16 formed nanofiber networks which were similar to the extra-cellular matrix. A549 grew well in the 3D peptide matrix, and with the culture time increased, its resistance to drug increased whereas its sensitivity to drug reduced. Regarding the adhesion ability to different extra-cellular matrix, there were significant differences between cells cultured in 3D RADA16 matrix and cells in 2D culture. Conclusion Under 3D RADA16 culture, cellular behaviors such as the growth, morphology, drug sensitivity and adhesion to extra-cellular matrix are significantly different from those in 2D culture.

Previous reports in this area have not adequately correlated these factors with coating optimization for specific biomedical applications. The present work is aimed at studying the effect of the structural and compositional properties on the biocompatibility of both hydrogenated and unhydrogenated tetrahedral DLC films produced by commercial deposition methods. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for structural and compositional characterization. The human bone derived cells (HBDC) 3 day cell-culture showed good attachment to the DLC surfaces but no significant difference in morphology on different types of DLC.

{"title": "Microstructure and Properties of 1.6% C Ultra-high Carbon Steel [J]\n", "abstract": " Heat treatments of DET (Divorced Eutectoid Transformation) and quenching+ tempering were carried out to obtain the microstructure of ferrite with ultra-fine carbides for a 1.6% C ultra-high carbon steel. Simultaneously microstructure of quenched steel was observed by transmission election microscope. It is shown that the sub-structure is composed of dislocations and twins. When increasing the time of inducing-heat quenching, the steel shows that the quantity of lath martensite increases but decreases with twin martensite. The mechanical properties are measured to indicate that the ultra-high carbon steel has almost the same intensity as structure steels with moderate carbon and good plasticity, with extension rate 17%.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["489"]}

The effect of titanium content and titanium alloying methods on LCF behavior is analyzed with plastic strain energy density. The results show that all alloys exhibit the cyclic hardening behavior. Raising Ti content can obviously increase the cyclic hardening ability. But the effect of Ti alloying method isn't distinct. Whether for the EA356 alloys or for MA356 alloys, the alloys with low titanium content have longer low-cycle fatigue life than that of the alloys with high titanium content. This is because that the alloys with low titanium content can consume higher cyclic plastic strain energy during cyclic deformation compared with alloys with high titanium content.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["489"]}

Chondrocytes were cultured when they were seeded onto PDLLA scaffolds with different porosity. Under scanning electron microscope, the scaffolds in hydrophila and adsorptivity to chondrocytes and the function of the cells were observed. The chondrocytes were noted to proliferate on PDLLA scaffolds with different porosity, those with 90%-96% porosity being significantly better. So PDLLA can be used as a scaffold in tissue engineering, and the proper porosity of PDLLA scaffolds should be 90% approximately 96%.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["489"]}

{"title": "Thermionic electron emission stability of Mo-La2O3 cathode\n", "abstract": " The carbonizing process and its influence on the thermionic electron emission properties of Mo-La2O3 cathode materials were investigated. The carbonized temperature, carbonized time and the pressure of C6H6 are key factors of the carbonizing process. The carbonized ratio of Mo-La2O3 cathode increases with the increase of carbonizing temperature at low temperature. The highest carbonized ratio is 19.7% obtained at 1723 K, then the carbonized ratio decreases rapidly if temperature increases further. The carbonized ratio increases with the prolongation of carbonizing time during the process of first 6 min., after that the carbonization ratio changes little with the time increase, and the carbonized ratio increases with the increase of the C6H6 pressure when the pressure is low, the maximum carbonized ratio reaches 19.7% at 1.5\u00d710-2 Pa, then the carbonized ratio goes down sharply when the C6H6 pressure is over 1.5\u00d710-2 Pa. The emission properties at different operated temperatures and the emission current stability of FU-6051 tubes equipped with Mo-La2O3 cathodes were also studied in the article. The study results indicate that the emission can keep stable only when the operating temperature is from 1700 to 1800 K and the carbonized layer must be composed by Mo2C only. The FU-6051 tubes equipped with Mo-La2O3 cathodes have excellent stable emission current and the lifetime exceeds 3000 h when the cathode\u2032s carbonized ratio is 19.7% operated at 1773 K.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["489"]}
{"title": "A Relational Model for Object-Oriented Requirement Analysis\n", "abstract": " This paper is concerned with the development of a methodology for object-oriented software development. The intention is to support effective use of a formal model for specifying and reasoning during the requirement analysis and design of a software development process. The overall purpose is to enhance the application of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) with a formal semantics in the Rational Unified Software Development Process (RDP). The semantic framework will define the meaning of some UML submodels. It must identify both the static and dynamic relationships among these submodels. This paper only deals with the requirement analysis activities and models in the RDP. Thus, the focus is the development of a semantic model to consistently combine a use-case model and a conceptual class diagrams to form a system specification. Reasoning and refinement of specifications can then be done by taking object diagrams as system states.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["489"]}
