{"title": "Explicit programming strategies\n", "abstract": " Software developers solve a diverse and wide range of problems. While software engineering research often focuses on tools to support this problem solving, the strategies that developers use to solve problems are at least as important. In this paper, we offer a novel approach for enabling developers to follow explicit programming strategies that describe how an expert tackles a common programming problem. We define explicit programming strategies, grounding our definition in prior work both within software engineering and in other professions which have adopted more explicit procedures for problem solving. We then present a novel notation called Roboto and a novel strategy tracker tool that explicitly represent programming strategies and frame executing strategies as a collaborative effort between human abilities to make decisions and computer abilities to structure process and persist information.

{"title": "Magnopark-locating on-street parking spaces using magnetometer-based pedestrians' smartphones\n", "abstract": " In heavily congested urban areas, the rapid growth of population is becoming more and more of an issue. Affected cities quickly demand solutions to areas such as quality of life, waste management, public transportation, and accessibility to main resources. However, since the number of impacted areas of population growth is endless, we focus on public parking. Studies show that drivers spend a large portion of their travel time locating vacant parking spots. For this reason, we present MagnoPark, a crowdsourced approach to identifying unoccupied spots accessible to the general public, who are typically free. MagnoPark is a smartphone based sensing solution that detects empty parking spots using internal sensors of cellphones. While a pedestrian is walking on the sidewalk, we exploit magnetometer changes near metal objects in identifying where cars are located.

{"title": "Detection of secondary structures from 3D protein images of medium resolutions and its challenges\n", "abstract": " Protein secondary structures such as \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands are major structural components in most proteins. The position of secondary structures provides important constraints in computing the tertiary structure of a protein. Electron cryomicroscopy is a biophysical technique that produces 3-dimensional images of large molecular complexes. For images at medium resolutions, such as 5\u201310\u00a0\u00c5, major secondary structures may be computationally detected. This paper summarizes our recent work in detection of secondary structures using SSETracer, SSELearner, StrandTwister and StrandRoller. The detection of helices and \u03b2-strands is illustrated using SSETracer and StrandTwister with a small dataset.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1905"]}
