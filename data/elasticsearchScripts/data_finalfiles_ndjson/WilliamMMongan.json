In this paper, we discuss the design and application of a wearable strain sensor, which can be used for biomedical monitoring such as contraction, respiration, or limb movements. The system takes advantage of the intensity variations of the backscattered power (RSSI) from an inductively-coupled RFID tag under physical stretching. First, we describe the antenna design along with the modeling of the sheet impedance, which characterizes the conductive textile. Experimental results with custom fabricated prototypes showed good agreement with the numerical simulation of input impedance and radiation pattern.

As the fabric antenna is stretched, the strength of the received signal varies, yielding potential for wearable, wireless, powerless smart-garment devices based on small and inexpensive passive RFID technology. Knit fabric sensors and other RFID biosensors can enable comfortable, continuous monitoring of biofeedback, but requires an integrated framework consisting of antenna modeling and fabrication, signal processing and machine learning on the noisy wireless signal, secure HIPAA- compliant data storage, visualization and human factors, and integration with existing medical devices and electronic health records (EHR) systems.

The circuitry and power required to monitor an infant's vital signs both with wired and wireless implementations are the main obstacles in realizing a seamless wearable infant monitor. In this paper, an unconventional battery-free and wireless infant heart and respiration rate monitor that uses passive RFID technology is proposed. Heart rate information is transmitted by turning an RFID tag on and off based on detection of heart beats and respiration rate is measured by monitoring the change in the received signal strength from the RFID tag due to respiratory activity. The system affords tremendous reduction in hardware and makes an integrated unobtrusive infant monitor possible. Such a monitor can contribute to reducing infant mortality by enabling continuous monitoring of potentially life threatening conditions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["2164"]}

{"title": "A methodology for developing an agent systems reference architecture\n", "abstract": " The slow adoption of agent-oriented methodologies as a paradigm for developing industry systems is due in part to their lack of integration and general-purpose use. There exists a need to define common patterns, relationships between components, and structural qualities that a reference architecture for agent-based systems would solve. However, there is little, if any, consensus on how to create a reference architecture for agent-based systems. This paper presents a methodology for developing a reference architecture that documents agent-based systems from different system viewpoints. Rather than the traditional approach of studying existing systems, the documentation methodology relies on forensic software analysis of agent frameworks (i.e., APIs and libraries for constructing agent systems). We demonstrate the methodology by describing the process used to create the Agent System Reference\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["2164"]}

Capturing the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a time-series signal, we classify whether the subject is breathing or not, estimate the rate at which the subject is breathing, and classify whether the tag is moving in a linear, non-stretched fashion. We improve upon previous efforts to classify subject state from RSSI signals by eliminating the need to train the classifier with both breathing and non-breathing sample data (which is biologically infeasible). To test our approach, we use a programmable breathing infant mannequin yielding accurate detection of cessation of respiratory activity within 5 seconds, and a maximum root-mean-square error of 7\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["2164"]}

We improve the utility of a single Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag by fusing multiple features of the tag, in order to precisely determine the frequency and magnitude of motion artifacts.

Currently, Emergency Medical Technicians in the field carry monitoring equipment that can weigh over 50 lbs, and manually communicate information back to hospital physicians. For patients, medical monitoring is carried out using tethered equipment that must remain attached for hours or days, and must be removed when the patient must get up to walk or use the restroom. Data lapses during these disconnected breaks can be misinterpreted by medical staff as a medical event, and true medical events can be missed as a result of non-monitoring. Further, being still for extended periods of time can exacerbate the very risks being treated, due to the increased risk of a blood clot while remaining stationary during monitoring.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["2164"]}

By employing machine learning classification on a multi-sensor wearable device, we are able to classify human subject state between \"positive\" and \"negative\" activities, and among each activity state, with greater than 95% accuracy. Some negative activity states cannot be accurately discriminated due to their similar presentation from an accelerometer (i.e., standing vs. sitting); however, it is desirable to separate these states to better inform the risk of developing a Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).
