The workflow engine accesses the node group database for the group of work nodes when the generic node is to be executed so as to allow dynamic composition and modification of the workflow process. Work nodes can be added to or removed from the node group without requiring that the workflow process be redefined.

This paper presents eFlow, a model and system that provides a flexible, configurable and open approach to service composition. In fact, eFlow has an adaptive and dynamic process model that allows processes to transparently adapt to changes in the environment, to customize service execution according to the customers' needs, and to cope with exceptional situations.

Surprisingly, today, most of the supply-chain activities are carried out manually, and IT support is often limited to having a set of (disconnected) data repositories. In addition, business-to-business (B2B) communications are performed via phone, fax or e-mail. Increasing the operational efficiency of the supply chain results in huge savings and is the key to remaining competitive or even gaining a competitive advantage. Furthermore, a more efficient supply chain also enables revenue growth, which is often impossible to sustain with the current manual operations. In this paper, we discuss the requirements and challenges for e-business applications that support supply-chain management. Then, we propose an architecture that meets the requirements and enables solutions that deliver results quickly and that evolve with the business and IT environment\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "36\n", "authors": ["1173"]}

{"title": "Process automation as the foundation for e-business\n", "abstract": " E-business is becoming the trademark of the 2000s. Companies are using the Web to communicate with their partners, connect with their back-end systems, and perform e-commerce transactions. However, the transition from traditional business to e-business requires a fundamental re-implementation of their business operational systems. Many companies have focused their transitions on developing webbased interfaces to their legacy applications. However, the backend infrastructure is often inadequate to support the offering, not only for established corporations but also, surprisingly, for many newly formed dotcoms. On the other hand, successful e-business companies have identified workflow as the key technology for connecting front-end and backend applications, for integrating, automating, and monitoring business and e-commerce processes, and for providing on-line service delivery. In this paper we discuss the benefits of workflow automation and we show why workflow is a key technology for building the foundation for ebusiness.

Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym (for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gym without social interaction.Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age= 71, sd= 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.

On the other hand, in most World Wide Web applications, and in particular, within organizations, the type of information provided in a Web site is based on organizational data, in many cases already stored in an existing information system or at least available on paper. When designing the computer supported information system of an organization, the use of a systematic approach is quite established, yet in the case of Web sites, such an approach is not a common practice. The result of a lack of a systematic approach to designing World Wide Web sites is the well-known difficulty in retrieving the required information, and one of the consequences is the mostly navigational and\" surfing\" approach to the use of the Web. This problem is particularly critical in long-distance courses, where the user typically needs to visit the site for a long period of time, and with great attention. In this chapter, we advocate the use of a methodological approach to the design of a long distance education application.

The current approach encourages authors to write many (possibly incremental) papers to get more \u201ctokens of credit\u201d, generating often unnecessary dissemination overhead for themselves and for the community of reviewers. Furthermore, it does not encourage or support reuse and evolution of publications: whenever a (possibly small) progress is made on a certain subject, a new paper is written, reviewed, and published, often after several months. We propose a paradigm shift in the way scientific knowledge is created, disseminated, evaluated and maintained. This shift is enabled by the notion of Liquid publications, which are evolutionary, collaborative, and composable scientific contributions. Many Liquid Publication concepts in this document are based on a parallel between scientific knowledge artifacts and software artifacts, and hence on lessons learned in (agile, collaborative, open source) software development. Liquid Publications concepts are reified by a model based on i) Scientific Knowledge Objects (SKOs), which are the digital instantiation of liquid publications, by ii) the processes involved in their creation, evolution, and quality assessment, and by iii) the people and roles that contribute to knowledge creation (authors, reviewers, bloggers..).

We explore the historical reasons behind the current journal model, and we show that this model is essentially the same today, even if the Web has made dissemination essentially free. We propose a notion of liquid and personal journals that evolve continuously in time and that are targeted to serve individuals or communities of arbitrarily small or large scales. The liquid journals provide \"interesting\" content, in the form of \"scientific contributions\" that are \"related\" to a certain paper, topic, or area, and that are posted (on their web site, repositories, traditional journals) by \"inspiring\" researchers. As such, the liquid journal separates the notion of \"publishing\" (which can be achieved by submitting to traditional peer review journals or just by posting content on the Web) from the appearance of contributions into the journals, which are essentially collections of content. In this paper we introduce the liquid journal model, and demonstrate through some examples its value to individuals and communities. Finally, we describe an architecture and a working prototype that implements the proposed model.", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["1173"]}

Scientific excellence has different meaning across communities [Lamont2009], and it is not easy to determine what are the more relevant characteristics that influence it. The most common approach to simplify the evaluation process is the use of bibliometric indicators such as the h-index [Hirsch2005]. Scientific impact, however, is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be adequately measured by any single indicator [Bollen2009][Lehmann2006][Martin1996] and the advent of the web era brought a whole new set of challenges that support this argument. While nothing is essentially wrong with using bibliometrics, we have come to understand that is not enough to measure the full scope of scientific impact [Adler 2009].The social web opened new ways for disseminating scientific knowledge, thus suggesting that the social dimension can be an important component of scientific reputation. The altmetrics initiative is on the right track to lead this development by analyzing research impact in terms of web and social attention alternative metrics. One use of social metrics is as an extension to bibliometric impact measures (eg article download statistics, number of bookmarks on Connotea or Mendeley).

Finding the valuable information hidden in the data is essential to the success of business.

The basic idea of a pixel bar chart is to present all data values directly instead of aggregating them into a few data values. Pixel bar charts provide data distribution and exceptions besides aggregated data. The approach is to represent each data item (e.g. a business transaction) by a single pixel in the bar chart. The attribute of each data item is encoded into the pixel color and can be accessed and drilled down to the detail information as needed.

When designing the computer supported information system of an organization, the use of a systematic approach is quite established, yet in the case of Web sites, such an approach is not a common practice. The result of a lack of a systematic approach to designing World WideWeb sites is the well-known difficulty in retrieving the required information, and one of the consequences is the mostly navigational and \u201csurfing\u201d approach to the use of the Web.

We concluded that realistic research evaluation is more complex than assumed by those indicators and, hence, may require the specification of even complex evaluation algorithms. While the reconstruction (or reverse engineering) of those algorithms from publicly available data is one of our research goals, in this paper we show how can we enable users to develop their own algorithms with Reseval, our mashup-based research evaluation platform, and how doing so requires dealing with a variety of data management issues that are specific to the domain of research evaluation.

{"title": "Composition patterns in data flow based mashups\n", "abstract": " Recently, mashup tools have emerged as popular end-user development platform. Composition languages used in mashup tools provide ways (drag-and-drop based visual metaphor for programming) to integrate data from multiple data sources in order to develop situational applications. However this integration task often requires substantial technical expertise from the developers in order to use basic composition blocks properly in their composition logic. Reusing of existing composition knowledge is one of the possible solutions to ease mashup development process. This reusable composition knowledge can be harvested from composition patterns that have occurred frequently in previously developed mashup. In order to understand composition patterns in mashups, particularly in data flow based mashups, in this paper, we have analyzed the composition language used by one of the most popular data-flow based mashup tools, Yahoo! Pipes. Based upon our analysis we have identified six composition patterns, which represent most commonly used composition steps during mashup application development.

To this end, we run a set of crowdsourcing experiments on the widely used IAPS dataset, using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) emotion collection instrument, in order to rate pictures on valence, arousal and dominance, and explore the consistency of crowdsourced results across multiple runs (reliability) and the level of agreement with the gold labels (quality). In doing so, we explored the impact of targeting populations of different level of reputation (and cost) and collecting varying numbers of ratings per picture. The results tell us that crowdsourcing can be a reliable method, reaching excellent levels of reliability and agreement with only 3 ratings per picture for valence and 8 per arousal, with only marginal difference between target populations. Results for dominance were very poor, echoing previous studies on the data collection instrument used. We also observed that specific types of content generate diverging opinions in participants (leading to higher variability or multimodal distributions), which remain consistent across pictures of the same theme.

{"title": "Detecting and preventing confused labels in crowdsourced data\n", "abstract": " Crowdsourcing is a challenging activity for many reasons, from task design to workers' training, identification of low-quality annotators, and many more. A particularly subtle form of error is due to confusion of observations, that is, crowd workers (including diligent ones) that confuse items of a class i with items of a class j, either because they are similar or because the task description has failed to explain the differences. In this paper we show that confusion of observations can be a frequent occurrence in many tasks, and that such confusions cause a significant loss in accuracy. As a consequence, confusion detection is of primary importance for crowdsourced data labeling and classification. To address this problem we introduce an algorithm for confusion detection that leverages an inference procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We evaluate the algorithm via both synthetic datasets and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1173"]}

The main reason is two-fold: it can create interest and attract people to the museum, and it can help people who for various cognitive or physical limitations cannot attend the visit, to still enjoy it. We conducted couple of surveys and we designed a possible platform for facilitating sharing, for which we report the preliminary results in this paper. Our findings show that i) although visitors claim that they would like to share their visit, the number of the actual sharing visitors is significantly low, ii) most of the visitors use only verbal narrations in order to share their experience with friends and families, and iii) visitors do not share emotions \u201cvirtually\u201d(eg, facebook or twitter) during the visit. Guided by these results we developed a potential solution through which sharing can be facilitated.

{"title": "Discovering and analyzing scientific communities using conference network\n", "abstract": " The increase number of scientific publications has made digital scientific literature search a difficult task and highly dependent of the researcher ability to search, filter and classify content. Most used scientific literature search engines and portals, such as Google Scholar, Citeseer and ACM, use only simple text-base and citation-base score to rank the query result, and the rank is barely useful. The number of references that a scientific publication has received (known as citations) determines the impact that the contribution has made to the community. Many methods (known as index) to measure or rank researchers are citation based. A fair index for these is important because it is used to evaluate and compare researchers for different purpose, such as university recruitment, faculty advancement, award of grants, among others. The world of science has many fields (Human, Social, Computer Science, etc.). Each field has different structures and publication dynamics. %\\ale{Cite newman2001 and Structure and Dyna..}. An example is the number of citations in the top-20 most cited journals in Computer Science is 4 times higher than the top-20 most cited journals in Social Science. Therefore, it is unfair to compare researchers using citation-based metrics without a context, in other words, the community they belong to. Different sizes of communities make currently most used metrics that measure the productivity or impact of researchers an unfair evaluation when comparing researchers from different communities since those with higher productivity are likely to produce more citations than communities with lower productivity.

{"title": "Engineering service-oriented systems: Modeling, discovery and quality\n", "abstract": " Service-oriented computing changes the face of modern software by decomposing its application logic. Now business systems can be assembled from loosely-coupled service components developed by various organizations and spread across the world. Service-Oriented Systems (SOSs) incorporate services running on different platforms and hosted by service providers outside of enterprise boundaries. This conceptually new approach to software development poses multiple questions to software engineers. The behaviour of incorporated web services may vary over time, as well as business rules underlying the system. The SOSs should be reactive to any changes in external services, such as service failures or performance decrease. Therefore, discovery of relevant service components and selection of business partners that guarantee good Quality of Service (QoS) are among the prime issues.In this thesis we investigate the problem of developing dependable SOSs from available web services. Firstly, we introduce an approach for conceptual modeling of SOSs, which prescribes a sequence of activities for transforming abstract business processes into service-based workflows. The approach is an extension of the Eriksson-Penker business process modeling framework. Service discovery, risk analysis and QoS-aware selection are parts of the design process. A case study is given to analyze the use of the proposed modeling method.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1173"]}

The next generation of applications will be developed in the form of services that are offered over a network, either a company's intranet or the Internet. Service-based architectures depend on an infrastructure that allows service providers to describe and advertise their services and service consumers to discover and select the services that best fulfill their requirements. Frameworks and messaging protocols for e-services in stationary and mobile environments are being developed and standardized, metadata and ontologies are being defined, and mechanisms are under development for service composition, delivery, monitoring, and payment. End-to-end security and quality of service guarantees will be essential for the acceptance of e-services. As e-services become pervasive, e-service management will play a central role. The workshop's objective is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present new developments and experience reports. The goal of the TES workshop is to identify the technical issues, models, and infrastructures that enable enterprises to provide e-services to other businesses and individual customers.

{"title": "Healthcare Business Processes Risks Identification and Management-Approach for Medication Administration Processes Re-engineering.\n", "abstract": " Medication administration in healthcare institutions is one of the critical processes that need to be carefully considered from the risk management point of view. Medical administration errors are costly from several perspectives as they lead to injuries, illness or even death and finally, significantly increase hospital expense. In this article, we argue that efficient risk management approaches for medication administration business processes are needed. Risks should be identified and mitigated well before critical error occurs. The presented work describes issues of healthcare business process risk individuation and propose a methodology for business process re-engineering to mitigate the identified risks. To show the potential impact of the approach, we illustrate the functioning of the methodology on the scenario derived from the application domain of the Nursy Rolly\u2122 industrial R&D project.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1173"]}

{"title": "A probabilistic-based approach to process model discovery\n", "abstract": " Process discovery is crucial for understanding how business operations are performed and how to improve them. The opportunity to discover process models exists given that many systems underlying the execution of process steps log their execution times. However, there are many challenges to discover the actual processes particularly complex ones and without making unrealistic assumptions. In this paper we present a novel probabilistic-based approach to discover high quality process models of any complexity. The approach has a series of steps to discover links between nodes corresponding to execution dependencies between tasks and at the end it ranks these links according to their probabilities of actually existing and classifies them according to their type. In this paper we formulate the process discovery problem, describe the challenges and describe our solution.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1173"]}
{"title": "On development practices for end users\n", "abstract": " The paper discusses some trends in end user programming (EUP) and takes inspiration from the discussions in a panel and in a vertical session on research evaluation within the second Search Computing workshop. We discuss the controversial successes and failures in this field and we elaborate on which facilities could foster adoption of end user programming. We discuss various dimensions of end user programming, including vertical versus horizontal language definition, declarative versus imperative approaches. We exemplify our discussion in the realistic scenario of research evaluation by comparing the Search Computing and ResEval approaches.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1173"]}

{"title": "Conceptual Modeling-ER 2009: 28th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, Gramado, Brazil, November 9-12, 2009, Proceedings\n", "abstract": " Conceptual modeling has long been recognized as the primary means to enable software development in information systems and data engineering. Conceptual modeling provides languages, methods and tools to understand and represent the application domain; to elicit, conceptualize and formalize system requirements and user needs; to communicate systems designs to all stakeholders; and to formally verify and validate systems design on high levels of abstraction. Recently, ontologies added an important tool to conceptualize and formalize system specification. The International Conference on Conceptual Modeling\u2013ER\u2013provides the premiere forum for presenting and discussing current research and applications in which the major emphasis is centered on conceptual modeling. Topics of interest span the entire spectrum of conceptual modeling, including research and practice in areas such as theories of concepts and ontologies underlying conceptual modeling, methods and tools for developing and communicating conceptual models, and techniques for transforming conceptual models into effective implementations. The scientific program of ER 2009 features several activities running in parallel.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1173"]}

{"title": "Idea Management in Social Networks\n", "abstract": " Idea Management (IM) has increasingly been adopted by organizations and companies to innovate their products and services. While the software systems that instrument IM definitely help in managing this practice, we have discovered that IM organizers are having problems to establish, inside these platforms, communities able to support IM initiatives; either they cannot attract enough participants or the participating people are simply not the right ones.Acknowledging that most organizations have today a presence in Facebook and are striving to grow active communities inside this social network, we propose to harness the creativity of their already established Facebook communities instead of starting innovation communities inside IM platforms. Facebook can benefit IM with large and diverse pools of active communities who may be more interested in helping tied persons or organizations.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1173"]}
