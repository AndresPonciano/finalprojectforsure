It is a well known fact that interlocking systems, due to their inherent complexity related to the high number of variables involved, are not amenable to automatic verification, typically incurring in state space explosion problems. The literature is however quite scarce on data concerning the size of interlocking systems that have been successfully proved with model checking techniques. In this paper we attempt a systematic study of the applicability bounds for general purpose model checkers on this class of systems, by studying the typical characteristics of control tables and their size parameters. The results confirm that, although small scale interlocking systems can be addressed by model checking, interlockings that control medium or large railway yards can not, asking for specialized verification techniques.", "num_citations": "86\n", "authors": ["1512"]}

Their relevance is essential when dealing with code generation in the safety-critical domain. This article presents the experience of a railway signaling systems manufacturer on this issue. Introduction of Model-Based Development (MBD) and code generation in the industrial safety-critical sector created a crucial paradigm shift in the development process of dependable systems. While traditional software development focuses on the code, with MBD practices the focus shifts to model abstractions. The change has fundamental implications for safety-critical systems, which still need to guarantee a high degree of confidence also at code level. Usage of the Simulink/Stateflow platform for modeling, which is a de facto standard in control software development, does not ensure by itself production of high-quality dependable code. This issue has been addressed by companies through the definition of modeling rules imposing restrictions on the usage of design tools components, in order to enable production of qualified code. The MAAB Control Algorithm Modeling Guidelines (MathWorks Automotive Advisory Board)[3] is a well established set of publicly available rules for modeling with Simulink/Stateflow. This set of recommendations has been developed by a group of OEMs and suppliers of the automotive sector with the objective of enforcing and easing the usage of the MathWorks tools within the automotive industry.

{"title": "Compositional verification of interlocking systems for large stations\n", "abstract": " Railway interlocking systems are responsible to grant exclusive access to a route, that is a sequence of track elements, through a station or a network. Formal verification that basic safety rules regarding exclusive access to routes are satisfied by an implementation is still a challenge for networks of large size due to the exponential computation time and resources needed.               Some recent attempts to address this challenge adopt a compositional approach, targeted to track layouts that are easily decomposable into sub-networks such that a route is almost fully contained in a sub-network: in this way granting the access to a route is essentially a decision local to the sub-network, and the interfaces with the rest of the network easily abstract away less interesting details related to the external world.

The evaluation has been carried out by comparing the automatically generated code with the manually implemented code, both compliant to the same SDL specification: this comparison is based on a selection of metrics measured on both codes by means of commercial static analysis tools. Notwithstanding the different structure of the two codes, we appropriately selected and aggregated the obtained results in order to use them as indicators of code size, control flow complexity and integration flow complexity. For a better comparison of the two codes, we have also introduced a novel complexity metric, which compares the control flow complexity with the integration flow of the two different software architectures.

{"title": "Safety interlocking as a distributed mutual exclusion problem\n", "abstract": " In several large scale systems (e.g. robotic plants or transportation systems) safety is guaranteed by granting to some process or physical object an exclusive access to a particular set of physical areas or objects before starting its own action: some mechanism should in this case interlock the action of the former with the availability of the latter. A typical example is the railway interlocking problem, in which a train is granted the authorisation to move only if the tracks in front of the train are free. Although centralised control solutions have been implemented since decades, the current quest for autonomy and the possibility of distributing computational elements without wired connection for communication or energy supply has raised the interest in distributed solutions, that have to take into account the physical topology of the controlled areas and guarantee the same level of safety.

These rules depend on the topology of the station and hence every single delivered system obeys a particular set of rules.

Part of these costs are due to the fact that testing has to be repeated for each delivered product, moreover, due to the complexity of such topologies, the test suites may be very large, and different for each product. In this paper we show how the problem has been addressed at the final validation stage of production interlocking systems, by extracting a model of the implemented interlocking logic from the on-target description of the topology.

{"title": "Validating the design of dependable systems\n", "abstract": " The paper presents an approach for the specification and verification of the correctness of dependable system designs achieved by the application of fault tolerant techniques based on equivalence relations and model checking techniques. The behaviour of the system in absence of faults is formally specified and faults are assumed as random events which interfere with the system by modifying its behaviour. The fault tolerant technique is formalized by a context, which specifies how replicas of the system cooperate to deal with faults. The system design is proved to satisfy the correctness property under a given fault hypothesis, by proving the observational equivalence between the system design specification and the fault free system specification. Additionally, model checking of a temporal logic formula which gives an abstract notion of correct behaviour can be applied to verify the correctness of the design.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1512"]}

Industrial systems are nowadays complex systems, i.e. they are characterized by a large number of components. This characteristic generally makes the analytical analysis unfeasible.

The reliability analysis performed using the MTBF is generally accurate for time intervals close to the commissioning and to the end-of-life but tends to be inaccurate otherwise. We propose a novel bottom-up layered approach to obtain the reliability curve.
