Several countries already meet or come close to achieving this goal. Iceland, for example, supplies 100% of its electricity needs with either geothermal or hydropower. Other countries that have electric grids with high fractions of renewables based on hydropower include Norway (97%), Costa Rica (93%), Brazil (76%), and Canada (62%). Hydropower plants have been used for decades to create a relatively inexpensive, renewable form of energy, but these systems are limited by natural rainfall and geographic topology. Around the world, most good sites for large hydropower resources have already been developed. So how do other areas achieve 100% renewable grids?

{"title": "The impact of the output power fluctuation of a wind farm on a power grid\n", "abstract": " In an offshore wind farm, a large number of wind turbines feed power into the power grid at the point of common coupling. The power fluctuation at each wind turbine is affected by the type of turbine, the control algorithm, the wind speed fluctuation, and the tower shadow effect. The power measurement from a single wind turbine usually shows a large fluctuation of output power. Because many turbines are connected in a wind farm, the power fluctuation from one turbine may cancel the power fluctuation of another turbine, effectively rectifying the power fluctuation of the overall wind farm. As wind energy technologies progress, wind turbines are getting larger. Wind turbine manufacturers are currently producing multimegawatt wind turbines. As wind turbines get larger, fewer turbines are needed to deliver the same power. Thus, the power fluctuation of an individual wind turbine will have a greater impact on the power network. The impact will be even greater on a weak grid. This paper explores the effects of wind farm power fluctuations on the power network. Utility companies are concerned about the effects of the power generated by a wind farm. Utilities need to ensure that the voltage variation, current harmonics, and voltage flicker stay within acceptable limits. Current harmonics issues will not be discussed in this paper, as present converters generate a very sinusoidal output current.

The integration of renewable energy continued to grow in 2014 against a backdrop of increasing global energy consumption and a dramatic decline in oil prices during the second half of the year. As renewable generation has become less expensive during recent decades, and it becomes more accepted by the global population, the focus on renewable generation has expanded from primarily wind and solar to include new types with promising future applications, such as hydropower generation, including river and tidal generation. Today, hydropower is considered one of the most important renewable energy sources. In river and tidal generation, the input resource flow is slower but also steadier than it is in wind or solar generation, yet the level of water turbulent flow may vary from one place to another.

As a result, wind turbine dynamometer facilities were developed to provide a more cost-effective alternative to field testing. New turbine designs were tested and the design models were validated using dynamometers to drive the turbines in a controlled environment. Over the years, both wind turbine dynamometer testing and computer technology have matured and improved, and the two are now being joined to provide hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing. This type of testing uses a computer to simulate the items that are missing from a dynamometer test, such as grid stiffness, voltage, frequency, rotor, and hub. Furthermore, wind input and changing electric grid conditions can now be simulated in real time.

This decline may continue due to increasing penetrations of inverter-coupled generation and the planned retirements of conventional thermal plants. Inverter-coupled variable wind generation is capable of contributing to PFR and inertia with a response that is different from that of conventional generation.

Adequate primary frequency response and secondary frequency response are the primary forces to correct an energy imbalance at the second-to-minute level. As wind energy becomes a larger portion of the world's energy portfolio, there is an increased need for wind to provide frequency response. This paper addresses one of the major concerns about using wind for frequency regulation: the unknown factor of the interaction between primary and secondary reserves. The lack of a commercially available tool to model this has limited the energy industry's understanding of when the depletion of primary reserves will impact the performance of secondary response or vice versa. This paper investigates the issue by developing a multi-area frequency response integration tool with combined primary and secondary capabilities. The simulation is conducted in close coordination with economical energy scheduling scenarios to ensure credible simulation results.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1051"]}

One of such requirement is for wind turbine to provide ancillary service in the form of inertial response. Such service requires wind turbine generators (WTGs) to inject additional energy to the grid when the grid frequency drops to help arrest the frequency decline. Inertial response will understandably impose additional dynamic loads on the wind turbine drivetrain, which have not been given much attention so far. To bridge this gap, this paper utilizes holistic models of both fixed-speed and variable-speed WTGs that integrate the aero-elastic wind turbine model in FAST, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, with a detailed electro-mechanical drivetrain model developed in SimDriveline and SimPowerSystems.

Because such oscillations result from interactions among slower control loops of wind turbines regulating the phasor quantities\u2014such as active power, reactive power, and the magnitude of voltages at the point of interconnection (POI)\u2014we propose a new type of admittance called power-domain admittance for the analysis. The power-domain admittance of a wind turbine gives the transfer function from the frequency and magnitude of the voltages at the POI to the active and reactive power outputs of the turbine. The power-domain admittance responses of the 4-MW wind turbine are measured using a 13.8-kV/7-MVA grid simulator to identify the source of the reactive power oscillations. The power-domain impedance analysis and PHIL experiments are performed to explain how a resonant mode inside the wind turbine manifests as turbine-to-turbine and plant-to-grid reactive power oscillations. It is discovered that higher grid impedance during weak grid conditions improves damping of reactive power oscillations between a wind power plant and the grid; however, a higher grid impedance also increases coupling among wind turbines and the risk of turbine-to-turbine reactive power oscillations. The efficacy of a simple droop-based solution in mitigating reactive power oscillations is demonstrated using power-domain impedance measurements and PHIL experiments.

Because power converters are not intrinsically sensitive to frequency transients, the frequency response of these grids might deteriorate. To lessen large frequency excursions, this paper proposes a method to counteract load-generation imbalances by commanding ultra-fast frequency-responding converter-based assets such as wind and battery energy storage. The set points derive from the amount of the imbalance, which is estimated using phasor measurement units (PMUs). Because the proposed technique depends on communications networks, local converter frequency control using an aggressive frequency droop function is also proposed to mitigate negative impacts by communications failures and/or cyberattacks. The benefits of the technique are demonstrated on a modified version of the IEEE 39-bus test power system, which incorporates optimally located PMUs as well as wind, solar, and battery energy storage assets.

In some countries that have developed renewable energy sources and systems, grid codes have been revised to require wind power plants (WPPs) to provide ancillary services to support the power system frequency in case of severe grid events. To do this, wind turbine generators (WTGs) should be deloaded to reserve a certain amount of active power for primary frequency response; however, deloading curtails annual energy production, and the market for this type of service needs to be further developed. In this report, we focus on the temporary frequency support provided by WTGs through inertial response. WTGs have potential to provide inertial response, but appropriate control methods should be implemented. With the implemented inertial control methods, wind turbines are capable of increasing their active power output by releasing some of their stored kinetic energy when a frequency excursion occurs. Active power can be temporarily boosted above the maximum power points, after which the rotor speed decelerates, and subsequently an active power output reduction restores the kinetic energy.

In this paper, we assess the properties of coupled machine-inverter systems by studying an elementary system comprised of a synchronous generator, three-phase inverter, and a load. Furthermore, the inverter model is formulated such that its power rating can be scaled continuously across power levels while preserving its closed-loop response. Accordingly, the properties of the machine-inverter system can be assessed for varying ratios of machine-to-inverter power ratings and, hence, differing levels of inertia. After linearizing the model and assessing its eigenvalues, we show that system stability is highly dependent on the interaction between the inverter current controller and machine exciter, thus uncovering a key concern with mixed machine-inverter systems and motivating the need for next-generation grid-stabilizing inverter controls.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1051"]}
{"title": "Novel Control Strategy for Multiple Run-of-the-River Hydro Power Plants to Provide Grid Ancillary Services\n", "abstract": " Electricity generated by Hydropower Plants (HPPs) contributes a considerable portion of bulk electricity generation and delivers it with a low carbon footprint. In fact, HPP electricity generation provides the largest share from renewable energy resources, which includes solar and wind energy. The increasing penetration of wind and solar penetration leads to a lowered inertia in the grid and hence poses stability challenges. In recent years, breakthrough in energy storage technologies have demonstrated the economic and technical feasibility of extensive deployments in power grids. Multiple ROR HPPs if integrated with scalable, multi time-step energy storage so that the total output can be controlled. Although, the size of a single energy storage is far smaller than that of a typical reservoir, cohesively managing multiple sets of energy storage distributed in different locations is proposed. The ratings of storages and multiple ROR HPPs approximately equals the rating of a large, conventional HPP. The challenges associated with the system architecture and operation are described. Energy storage technologies such as supercapacitors, flywheels, batteries etc. can function as a dispatchable synthetic reservoir with a scalable size of energy storage will be integrated. Supercapacitors, flywheels, and battery are chosen to provide fast, medium, and slow responses to more\u00bb", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1051"]}
{"title": "Distributed real-time simulations for electric power engineering\n", "abstract": " Real-Time Simulations (RTS) are increasingly being used to understand the complex device and system level interactions in power grids. RTS provides the capability to create detailed, highly accurate, and diverse set of power and control system components at low time steps (order of microseconds) that are based on \u201creal-world clock-time.\u201d RT simulator is a unique architecture with specialized processors and communication boards that allow time synchronization of simulations and the clocktime. Lean operating systems, specialized processors, faster communications, etc. are the typical attributes of RT simulators. RT simulators provide a unique capability of interfacing with power and control components via analog and digital interfaces. However, RT simulators have limited computational capability that constrains the size of power and control systems that can be simulated. Multiple simulators connected locally is typically used to increase the computation capability, however this is not always economical. Additionally, RT simulators are used at facilities with unique test infrastructure in the form of grid emulators, inverters, photovoltaic, wind turbine, microgrids, etc. Performing distributed RTS via Internet can augment simulation capacity and leverage unique infrastructure that is dispersed in academia and research laboratories. Research related to distributed RTS and its application in electric power engineering is discussed in this chapter.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1051"]}

The WPP is connected to a high-voltage direct-current voltage source converter HVDC-VSC to deliver the power to the onshore substation. The wind turbine generator (WTG) used is a doubly-fed induction generator (Type 3 WTG).

{"title": "Dynamic braking system of a tidal generator\n", "abstract": " Renewable energy generation has experienced significant cost reductions during the past decades, and it has become more accepted by the global population. In the beginning, wind generation dominated the development and deployment of renewable energy; however, during recent decades, photovoltaic (PV) generation has grown at a very significant pace due to the tremendous decrease in the cost of PV modules. The focus on renewable energy generation has now expanded to include new types with promising future applications, such as river and tidal generation. The input water flow to these types of resources is more predictable than wind or solar generation. The data used in this paper is representative of a typical river or tidal generator. The analysis is based on a generator with a power rating of 40 kW. The tidal generator under consideration is driven by two sets of helical turbines connected to each\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1051"]}
{"title": "Estimating the Economic Potential of Offshore Wind in the United States\n", "abstract": " The potential for cost reduction and market deployment for offshore wind varies considerably within the United States. This analysis estimates the future economic viability of offshore wind at more than 7,000 sites under a variety of electric sector and cost reduction scenarios. Identifying the economic potential of offshore wind at a high geospatial resolution can capture the significant variation in local offshore resource quality, costs, and revenue potential. In estimating economic potential, this article applies a method initially developed in Brown et al.(2015) to offshore wind and estimates the sensitivity of results under a variety of most likely electric sector scenarios. For the purposes of this analysis, a theoretical framework is developed introducing a novel offshore resource classification system that is analogous to established resource classifications from the oil and gas sector. Analyzing economic potential within this framework can help establish a refined understanding across industries of the technology and site-specific risks and opportunities associated with future offshore wind development. The results of this analysis are intended to inform the development of the US Department of Energy's offshore wind strategy.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1051"]}
{"title": "Investigating Power System Primary and Secondary Reserve Interaction under High Wind Penetration Using Frequency Response Model\n", "abstract": " Power system frequency needs to be maintained close to its nominal value at all times to avoid machine damage, under-frequency load-shedding and even blackouts. Adequate primary frequency response and secondary frequency response are the primary forces to correct an energy imbalance at the second to minute level. As wind energy becomes a larger portion of the world's energy portfolio, there are greater oppotunities for wind to provide frequency response services. This paper addresses one area of frequency control that has been missing in previous work-the reliabilty impacts and interactions between primary and secondary frequency control. The lack of a commercially available tools to simulate the interaction of these two responses has limited the energy industry's understanding of when the depletion of primary control reserve will impact the performance of secondary conrol response or vice versa. To investigate this issue, in this paper we develop a multi-area frequency response integration model with combined primary and secondary frequency control capabilities.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1051"]}
{"title": "Simulation tool to assess mechanical and electrical stresses on wind turbine generators\n", "abstract": " Wind turbine generators (WTGs) consist of many different components to convert kinetic energy of the wind into electrical energy for end users. Wind energy is accessed to provide mechanical torque for driving the shaft of the electrical generator. The conversion from wind power to mechanical power is governed by the aerodynamic conversion. The aerodynamic-electrical-conversion efficiency of a WTG is influenced by the efficiency of the blades, the gearbox, the generator, and the power converter. This paper describes the use of MATLAB/Simulink to simulate the electrical and grid-related aspects of a WTG coupled with the FAST aeroelastic wind turbine computer-aided engineering tool to simulate the aerodynamic and mechanical aspects of a WTG. The combination of the two enables studies involving both electrical and mechanical aspects of a WTG.

{"title": "Market designs for the primary frequency response ancillary service\n", "abstract": " The first part of this two-paper series discusses the motivation of implementing a primary frequency response (PFR) market in restructured pool-based power markets, as well as the market design that would create the right incentives to provide the response reliably. PFR is the immediate, autonomous response of generation and demand to system frequency deviations. It is the critical response required to avoid triggering under- and over-frequency relays or instability that could lead to machine damage, load-shedding, and in the extreme case, blackouts. Currently, in many restructured power systems throughout the world, ancillary services markets have been developed to incent technologies to provide the services to support power system reliability. However, few ancillary services markets include a market explicitly incentivizing the provision of PFR. Historically, PFR was an inherent feature available in conventional generating technologies, and in most systems, more was available than needed. Yet, recent trends in declining frequency response, the introduction of emerging technologies, and market behavior may soon require innovative market designs to incent resources to provide this valuable service.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1051"]}
