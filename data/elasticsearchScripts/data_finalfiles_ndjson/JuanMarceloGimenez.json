The main objective of this paper is to present and to validate a computational modeling approach to accurately predict the mean wind pressure coefficient on the surfaces of flat-, gable- and hip-roofed rectangular buildings.

Three separate ANN models were developed, one for each roof type, and trained using an experimental database.

In this context, a new method is proposed to simplify the coupling at the interface based on the construction of a simplified supermesh. Here, a supermesh is not completely defined, instead, the interface faces are logically duplicated (or multiplied) to generate a one-to-one connectivity between them. The simplified supermesh named pseudo-supermesh eliminates the interpolations and assures the conservation of fluxes based on the trivial connectivity.

Thanks to the recent advances in hardware, in particular the possibility of using graphic processors (GPGPU), high performance computing is now available if and only if software development gives an important jump to incorporate this technology. Due to the complexity in programming over such a platform the best way to take advantage of its performance rests on the design of numerical methods able to be viewed as cellular automata. In this sense explicit methods seem to be an attractive choice. However it is well known that explicit methods have a severe stability limitation. On the other hand, the spatial discretization of particle methods offers some advantages against others like finite elements or finite volumes in terms of computational costs. The main reasons of this rest on the low dimensionality of this method (particle methods are a zero dimensional representation of the solution of a given set of PDE\u2019s while finite elements are 3D and finite volume are part 2D and part 3D). In addition particle methods are generally written in Lagrangian formulation avoiding the necessity of defining a spatial stabilization in convection dominated flows. Finite elements and finite volume are generally designed using an Eulerian formulation with some extra diffusion in the solution due to this stabilization requirement.

In order to reduce the long history of this method here the starting point begins with the reformulation of the method to solve academic and real problems in real time or at least in drastically reduced computational times. The main topics involved in this paper are around the stability and the accuracy of Lagrangian formulations against its Eulerian counterpart shown through several academic benchmarks and a deep analysis of the efficiency revealing that the original method needs some new\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1847"]}
{"title": "The Pseudo-Direct Numerical Simulation method for multi-scale problems in mechanics\n", "abstract": " We present an overview of the Pseudo-Direct Numerical Simulation (P-DNS in short) method for the solution of multi-scale phenomena. The method can be seen as an adaptation of the variational multi-scale (VMS) method, where the fine solution is solved numerically instead of analytically. Also, from the point of view of homogenization methods it can be seen as an evolution of Finite Element square (FE 2) methods, where the most expensive part of the computations is performed offline. The name of P-DNS arises from the premise that in all multi-scale simulations the numerical result obtained with a very fine discretization is correct without the need to introduce any additional model (ie turbulence models) or stabilization procedures for transport equation terms (as in residual-based VMS methods). What is intended here is that the P-DNS solution tends to the DNS solution of the problem, accepting as a premise\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1847"]}
{"title": "Advances in the Pseudo-DNS Methodology: Database Construction for the Averaged Inertial Stresses on the Internal RVE\n", "abstract": " Pseudo Direct Numerical Simulation (pseudo-DNS) is a novel concurrent multiscale methodology which splits the numerical solution into two: the coarse and the fine parts. Here, the coarse scale solution is computed as usual using a relatively coarse mesh but including the pre-computed inertial stresses from the fine-scale solution. To introduce the basis of the method, in this work the pseudo-DNS model is first applied to the classical convection-diffusion problem. Secondly, in the context of Navier-Stokes solutions far from walls, a database for the fine-scale response is constructed. Several DNSsimulations varying the dimensionless tensor Id, which can be reduced to two parameters, are carried out on a Representative Volume Element (internal RVE) to obtain the averaged internal stresses. Numerical results reveal that some critic Id magnitude, named Idc, can be found. The latter allows distinguishing two kinds of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1847"]}
{"title": "Development of a parallelised fluid solver for problems with mesh interfaces and deforming domains\n", "abstract": " Numerical simulation of piston\u2013cylinder problems such as internal combustion engines suffers from two difficulties related to discretization: the non-matching interfaces between cylinder and ports and the large deformation of the cylinder region. In this context, this paper presents a parallelized computational strategy, based on the Finite Volume method, where the mentioned issues are overcome. The non-matching discretization between regions is addressed with a new methodology which integrates the Arbitrary Coupled Mesh Interface (ACMI) method with the pseudo-supermesh approach to couple conservatively mesh interfaces with partial overlapping. For the large cylinder deformations, a layer addition/removal strategy is enhanced with mesh deformation to improve the handling of the mesh resolution.

{"title": "OpenFOAM DNS for Constructing a Boundary Layer Database for the Pseudo-DNS MODEL\n", "abstract": " This paper presents advances in the development of pseudo-DNS, a new turbulence modelbased on precomputed inertial stresses and a concurrent multiscale approach. The model relies on solving a \u201ccoarse\u201d subproblem by computing, on a relatively coarse grid, the flow of a pseudofluid, using a database of sub-grid inertial stresses precomputed in separate \u201cfine\u201d subproblem simulations. These inertial stresses are assumed to depend only on a dimensionless tensor, namely Id, related to the kinematic viscosity of the real fluid and the local velocity gradient and local coarse mesh size. Databases are assembled using DNS simulations of a set of fine problems in hexahedral domains with structured meshes, using \u201cjump\u201d boundary conditions to impose the desired velocity gradients. Each fine subproblem is simulated until a statistically steady state is achieved. The results are post-processed to obtain time-mean inertial stresses averaged in a subdomain, called Representative Volume Element or RVE. The RVE simulation results are stored in the database. A distinction is made between a \u201cboundary layer RVE\u201d (or \u201cwall RVE\u201d, characterized by having one of its faces in contact with a solid wall), and an \u201cinternal RVE\u201d otherwise. Pseudo-DNS requires a database to be built for each one of these two types. For the wall RVE, fortunately, the tensorial Id may be reduced to a scalar one. The present work focuseson the construction of the wall RVE database, using DNS simulations of incompressible turbulent flow between parallel moving plates with null imposed pressure gradient. We present a mesh convergence analysis and the resulting wall RVE\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1847"]}

{"title": "Applying the volume of fluid technique on atomization simulations\n", "abstract": " Atomization is a complex phenomenon, particularly difficult to simulate due to its physical characteristics, such as its long range of scales and discontinuous nature of the interphase. There are several alternatives to represent the interphase. The Volume of Fluid (VoF) is a widely adopted technique that employs a phase volume fraction function to distinguish between the fluids involved. An open-source implementation is available on the the OpenFoam FVM suite for incompressible immiscible flows, called interFoam. This application solves the color function advection equation using High Resolution Schemes limited with a Flux Corrected Transport in conjunction with a compression flux in order to reduce diffuses errors.
