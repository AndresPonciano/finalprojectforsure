Sq? 1 based upon a roll-to-roll compatible post-processing technique\n", "abstract": " A report of transparent and conducting silver nanowires (AgNWs) that produce remarkable electrical performance, surface planarity and environmental stability is given. This research presents an innovative process that relies on three sequential steps, which are roll-to-roll (R2R) compatible: thermal embossing, infrared sintering and plasma treatment. This process leads to the demonstration of a conductive film with a sheet resistance of 2.5 \u03a9 sq\u22121 and high transmittance, thus demonstrating the highest reported figure-of-merit in AgNWs to date (FoM = 933). A further benefit of the process is that the surface roughness is substantially reduced compared to traditional AgNW processing techniques. The consideration of the long-term stability is given by developing an accelerated life test process that simultaneously stresses the applied bias and temperature. Regression line fitting shows that a \u223c150-times improvement in stability is achieved under \u2018normal operational conditions\u2019 when compared to traditionally deposited AgNW films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is used to understand the root cause of the improvement in long-term stability, which is related to reduced chemical changes in the AgNWs.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["831"]}

{"title": "ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF GINGER CULTIVATION IN HASSAN DISTRICT OF KARNATAKA\n", "abstract": " Ginger is one of the earliest known oriental spices and is being cultivated in India for both as fresh vegetable and as a dried spice, since time immemorial. Present study was undertaken to examine the land use and lease pattern in ginger cultivation. Primary data was collected from 40 Owner cultivated and 40 leased-in cultivated ginger farmers in Hassan district of Karnataka. Costs and returns concept and Cobb-Douglas analysis were employed to analyze the economics and resource use efficiency. Sustainability of ginger cultivation was assessed by using sustainability index. Constraints in ginger cultivation were documented and analyzed using Garrett's ranking technique. In the study area majority of the farmers who leased out lands were marginal farmers (75%) and those who have leased-in lands were large farmers (47.24%). Leased-in ginger farmers incurred relatively higher cost of cultivation per hectare (Rs. 4, 03,258) compared with owner cultivated ginger farmers (Rs. 3, 67,339). It is found that the ginger is a highly capital intensive crop. However, net returns per hectare realized with also higher with leased-in farms (Rs. 3, 34,004) compared with owner cultivated farms (Rs. 2, 92,556) per hectare. Input use intensity reveals that leased-in farmers were found to use fertilizer more than the recommended dosage (173%) compared to owner cultivated ginger farmers (122.5%). Sustainability analysis indicated that ginger cultivation was unsustainable as indicated by the indices. The major constraints expressed by the ginger farmers were high incidence of disease, high rhizome cost, non availability of varieties, low quality rhizome, high input\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["831"]}

The experiment consisted twelve treatment combinations comprising four water regimes 0.6 (w1), 0.8 (w2) and 1.0 (w3) volume of water through drip, respectively given at alternate day interval and another one 1.0 (w4) volume of water by surface irrigation method given on every seventh day interval. For fertilization, Three RDF levels of NPK viz. 75%(F1), 100%(F2) and 125%(F4) were taken. Fertilizer applied as fertigation (ten split doses) under drip irrigation treatments at fifteen days interval and in surface irrigation treatment apply whole dose of recommended fertilizer as basal in the starting of experiment. The experiment was laid out in splitplot design with four replications. The interaction effect of 0.8 volume of water through drip+ fertigation of 100 per cent RDF recorded significantly higher fruit yield, B: C ratio, P and K content in leaf whereas maximum N content in leaf found under same volume of water with fertigation of 125% RDF.The ascorbic acid content in fruit was found highest under 0.8 volume of water through drip+ fertigation of 100 per cent RDF but it was at par with 0.8 volume of water through drip+ fertigation of 125 per cent RDF. Further, the significantly higher available N, P and K content in soil were found under 0.6 volume of water through along with fertigation of 100 per cent RDF whereas it remains at par with same volume of water+ fertigation of 125 per cent RDF.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["831"]}

{"title": "A position space renormalisation group approach to the compressible Ising model\n", "abstract": " A position space renormalisation group procedure is developed for the compressible Ising model. The procedure is essentially a generalisation of the cell variable approach of Niemeijer and Van Leeuwen (1974) in that vibrational cell variables are introduced in addition to spin cell variables. The procedure is applied to the two-dimensional triangular lattice, the shearless square lattice. In both cases the rigid Ising fixed point is stable to spin-lattice coupling as long as the latter is small. Beyond a critical strength of the spin-lattice coupling, the system develops instability leading to, presumably, a first-order transition. For the shearless square lattice the conclusion is at variance with the exact result of Baker and Essam (1971), so the approximation is regarded as unreliable for larger values of the spin-lattice coupling (1971).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["831"]}
{"title": "Theory of substitutionally disordered Heisenberg ferromagnets\n", "abstract": " A calculation of the spin-wave spectra of a disordered Heisenberg ferromagnet in which two species of spins are randomly distributed is presented. The theory is developed within a cluster coherent potential approximation in which a cluster of spins consisting of a central spin and the shell of its Z nearest neighbours is embedded in an effective medium and its scattering is considered with respect to the medium. For simplicity it is assumed that scattering due to the cluster depends only on the number of the different types of atoms constituting the shell rather than on their detailed configurations on the shell. Correlated site and bond disorder, an important feature of the magnetic problem, is handled in a relatively simple manner.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["831"]}

In group I, the fractures were immobilised by internal fixation with Veterinary Cuttable Plate (VCP) and in group II, the fractures were immobilised by polypropylene mesh impregnated PMMA plates and evaluated based on weight bearing and radiographic evaluation to study the healing of fracture with both plates. In group I, the animal showed mild to moderate weight bearing by 0 to 15th day and group II, the animals showed mild to moderate weight bearing by 7th to 15th day. Both the groups showed good to very good weight bearing by 30 to 60th day. Upon radiography, the group I showed minimal callus at the fracture site where as, the group II showed more callus formation on the far cortex side. It could be concluded from study that The polypropylene mesh impregnated PMMA plates has sufficient strength to provide stability of fracture site The veterinary cuttable plate provide slightly better stability at fracture site compared to polypropylene mesh PMMA plates as evidenced by radiographic study.

{"title": "DO Modelling and Water Quality analysis of River Brahmaputra in Guwahati, Assam\n", "abstract": " Water quality of Brahmaputra River has been deteriorating at a rapid rate as a result of frequent floods, soil erosion and effluent disposal. This piece of work deals with research, experimentation and analysis of the cause and impact of pollution on river water mainly due to effluent disposal. In the present work, water samples are collected from three different points along the river Brahmaputra in Guwahati city during monsoon (August 2016) and water quality assessment is carried out. Water quality assessment parameters like pH, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen and Fluoride content values are determined using laboratory tests at BITS-Pilani to identify the highly correlated and interrelated parameters. Modelling of Dissolved Oxygen is done using Streeter Phelps model to analytically arrive at the DO sag curve. Calculated Dissolved Oxygen values are compared with the observed values to obtain a fair idea about the variation of Dissolved Oxygen consequent to the impact of nonpoint/unregulated sources of pollution along the river. Higher pH value was obtained from the water sample collected at site-2 (Fancy Bazar, Guwahati), sample obtained from site-1 (Narangi, Guwahati) is least turbid, sample obtained from site-3 (Saraighat, Guwahati) has maximum amount of dissolved oxygen but there is no fluoride content in any of the samples. The mean values of all the measured physicochemical parameters of Brahmaputra river water are compared with the desirable limit set by WHO Considerable variations of DO values of predicted and tested levels have been observed and subsequent conclusions have been derived with appropriate suggestions\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["831"]}
