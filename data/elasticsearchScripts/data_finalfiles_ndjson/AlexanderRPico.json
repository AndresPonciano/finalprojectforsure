To better define these regulatory cues, we modified the H9 hESC line to allow selection of pluripotent hESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns. Splice events for these groups corresponded to the pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control as well as genes with serine/threonine kinase and helicase activity. Using a new program named AltAnalyze (http://www.AltAnalyze.org), we identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and that promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. By combining genome-wide predictions of alternative splicing with new functional annotations, our data suggest potential mechanisms that may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation.", "num_citations": "96\n", "authors": ["832"]}

The semantic web provides a standard to facilitate knowledge integration using statements built as triples describing a relation between two objects.

Having biological pathways in the semantic web allows rapid integration with data from other resources that contain information about elements present in pathways using SPARQL queries. In order to convert WikiPathways content into meaningful triples we developed two new vocabularies that capture the graphical representation and the pathway logic, respectively. Each gene, protein, and metabolite in a given pathway is defined with a standard set of identifiers to support linking to several other biological resources in the semantic web. WikiPathways triples were loaded into the Open PHACTS discovery platform and are available through its Web API (https://dev.openphacts.org/docs) to be used in various tools for drug development.

This score can then be visualized on the complex nodes using the visualization options provided by the plugin. Using the merged collection of curated and converted Reactome pathways, we demonstrate improved pathway coverage of relevant biological processes for the analysis of a previously described polycystic ovary syndrome gene expression dataset.

{"title": "Proteomic analysis of heart failure hospitalization among patients with chronic kidney disease: The Heart and Soul Study\n", "abstract": " Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for heart failure (HF). We aimed to investigate differences in proteins associated with HF hospitalizations among patients with and without CKD in the Heart and Soul Study.   Methods and results We measured 1068 unique plasma proteins from baseline samples of 974 participants in The Heart and Soul Study who were followed for HF hospitalization over a median of 7 years. We sequentially applied forest regression and Cox survival analyses to select prognostic proteins. Among participants with CKD, four proteins were associated with HF at Bonferroni-level significance (p<2.5x10-4): Angiopoietin-2 (HR[95%CI] 1.45[1.33, 1.59]), Spondin-1 (HR[95%CI] 1.13 [1.06, 1.20]), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (HR[95%CI] 0.65[0.53, 0.78]) and neurogenis locus notch homolog protein 1 (NOTCH1) (HR[95%CI] 0.67[0.55, 0.80]). These associations persisted at p<0.01 after adjustment for age, estimated glomerular filtration and history of HF. CKD was a significant interaction term in the associations of NOTCH1 and Spondin-1 with HF. Pathway analysis showed a trend for higher representation of the Cardiac Hypertrophy and Complement/Coagulation pathways among proteins prognostic of HF in the CKD sub-group.   Conclusions These results suggest that markers of heart failure differ between patients with and without CKD. Further research is needed to validate novel markers in cohorts of patients with CKD and adjudicated HF events.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["832"]}

Background Novel biomarkers for sudden death risk stratification are needed in patients with CHD to more precisely target preventive therapies, such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. miRNAs have been implicated in regulating inflammation and cardiac fibrosis in cells, and plasma miRNAs have been shown to predict cardiovascular death in patients with CHD.

Previous data suggest that platelet gene expression is associated with key cardiometabolic phenotypes, including body mass index but stable in healthy individuals over time. However, modulation of gene expression in platelets in response to metabolic shifts (eg, weight reduction) is unknown and may be important to defining mechanism.   Approach and Results: Platelet RNA sequencing and aggregation were performed from 21 individuals with massive weight loss (>45 kg) following bariatric surgery. Based on RNA sequencing data, we measured the expression of 67 genes from isolated platelet RNA using high-throughput quantitative reverse transcription quantitative PCR in 1864 FHS (Framingham Heart Study) participants.

{"title": "Identifying genes in published pathway figure images\n", "abstract": " BACKGROUND Pathway figures are commonly found in the biomedical literature providing intuitive models of complex processes in a visually concise format. The contents of a pathway figure often reflect the key findings and relevant context of an article. Unfortunately, the vast majority of pathway figures are drawn as one-off static images despite freely available pathway tools and resources, thus rendering their contents inaccessible to search, data mining and downstream analysis.APPROACH Leveraging advances in optical character recognition and domain expertise in pathway modeling, we devised an approach to identify genes in published pathway figures. The approach was optimized against a set of figure images obtained from PubMed Central and tested against a set of 400 curated pathways with known content from WikiPathways (F-measure 95.2%).RESULTS Applied to 3982 published pathway figures spanning a four year period, our approach identified 29,189 gene symbols representing 4159 unique gene identifiers. The gene content unlocked from just this small sample of published figures includes novel and diverse pathway associations unmatched by any pathway database. Our approach over doubled the number of genes associated with the articles containing these figures as compared to combined annotations available from PubMed and PubTator. Encouraged by these initial results, we plan to scale the approach to make the molecular contents of the continuing stream of published pathway figures more accessible.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["832"]}
