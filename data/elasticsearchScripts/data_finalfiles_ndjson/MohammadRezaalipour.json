{"title": "Arselda: An Improvement on Adaptive Random Testing by Adaptive Region Selection\n", "abstract": " Distance-aware Forgetting Fixed Size Candidate Set (DF-FSCS) is an Adaptive Random Testing (ART) technique, which lowers the computational overhead of Fixed Size Candidate Set ART (FSCS-ART), using a forgetting strategy. DF-FSCS partitions the input domain into regions, and while computing the distance of a candidate test case from executed test cases, as a vector in the input domain, it only considers test cases that are in the same region as the candidate. Although being a lightweight technique, there are two issues with DF-FSCS. First, it does not attempt to generate test cases in low-density regions, which if done, could result in a more even spread of test cases. Second, the regions it defines are smaller at the lower or upper boundaries of input domains, which declines the quality of test cases produced in these regions. We propose Arselda, an APR technique that improves DF-FSCS. By generating\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2134"]}
{"title": "AxMAP: Making Approximate Adders Aware of Input Patterns\n", "abstract": " Making approximate computing specific to user requirements is crucial to system performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability. However, developing hardware for such optimization becomes a significant challenge due to the high cost of examining all potential choices while exploring a large design space. One determinant aspect of exploring a design space is the efficiency of evaluating error metrics, such as the Mean Error Distance (MED) and the Error Probability (EP), for each possible choice within the search space. Since computing these error-metrics is quite time-consuming, efficient calculation approaches are essential. This article proposes a novel formal approach to accurately compute the EP and MED of approximate adders for any input pattern at a linear time and space complexity. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can accurately compute the error-metrics of large\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["2134"]}
{"title": "An Approach to Generate Effective Fault Localization Methods for Programs\n", "abstract": " Software Debugging is a tedious and costly task in software development life-cycle. Thus, various automated fault localization approaches have been proposed to address this problem, among which, spectrum-based fault localization has attracted a lot of attention. Using various formulas, known as ranking metrics, spectrum-based fault localization techniques assign scores to the entities of programs (e.g., statements) based on their suspiciousness of being the root cause of failures. Despite the obvious advantages of spectrum-based fault localization techniques, such as being lightweight, they cannot effectively locate faults in every program owing to the fact that they do not consider the characteristics of the programs. We believe that program characteristics can be helpful at finding the right ranking metrics for programs, and they can assist at combining several existing ones to produce a customized\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2134"]}
