{"title": "Towards specifying reactive autonomic systems with a categorical approach: a case study\n", "abstract": " Software complexity is the main obstacle to further progress in the IT industry. One solution is the autonomic system with self-* properties. Formal methods are proven approaches to ensuring the correct operation of complex interacting systems. However, the current formal methods do not adequately address the problem of verifying two of the most important features of auto-nomic systems, namely emergent behavior and evolving behavior. Category Theory (CT) has recently been proposed as a formal framework to provide a structure for isolating the management of evolving specifications and the analysis of changes. We propose a formal framework based on CT in this paper to specify reactive autonomic systems. Our approach is illustrated with a NASA case study.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["2016"]}
{"title": "Towards a tool support for specifying complex software systems by Categorical Modeling Language\n", "abstract": " Formal methods are proven approaches to ensure the correct operation of complex interacting systems. However, current formal methods do not address well problems of verifying emergent behavior and evolution, which are two of the most important characteristics of complex software systems. A subset of the Category Theory has been proposed in this paper to specify such systems. The categorical modeling language depicted here is the first step towards a powerful modeling paradigm capable of modeling emerging and evolving behavior of complex software. The approach is illustrated with a case study of Prospecting Asteroid Mission (PAM) from the NASA.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["2016"]}
{"title": "Towards Specifying Swarm-Based Systems using Categorical Modeling Language: A Case Study\n", "abstract": " One of the solutions to the software complexity crisis of this era is the proposition of self-managing systems like autonomous and autonomic systems. The idea has gained wide acceptance in the IT industry but it has also introduced the challenge of specification and development of such systems. Swarm intelligence is finding its applications in research and design of self-managing systems because of the coincidental resemblance between the two domains. However, specification of a swarm-based self-managing system is faced with the difficulty of specifying the complex evolving behavior.  This thesis presents an adaptation of a mathematical technique known as Category Theory to serve as a \u2018reasoning and modeling\u2019 paradigm for specifying high-level behavioral patterns of a swarm-based self-managing systems. The crux of this paradigm is the formal categorical modeling language (CML). CML syntax and semantics have been defined using an EBNF-based context-free grammar. The language helps to generate a formal specification of different scenarios/behavioral patterns of a swarm-based system. Moreover, a prototype tool has been implemented as part of this research work to serve as a modeling tool based on CML. In this thesis, NASA\u2019s ANTS-based Prospecting Asteroid Mission (PAM) serves as a case study to analyze the applicability and usability of CML as a formal method of choice.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2016"]}
