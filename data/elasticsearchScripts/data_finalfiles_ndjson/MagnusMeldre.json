{"title": "Using Impact Mapping in Agile Software Product Management\n", "abstract": " The author of this thesis has over 10 years of experience working with software products and is currently working as product owner (PO) and agile coach in a technology company. During the years industry trends have shifted towards Lean and Agile practices. The role of the PO defined by Scrum framework has emerged but the responsibilities for the role have not been unambiguously defined. To succeed with products and businesses from various backgrounds PO needs to vastly adapt and master different techniques. In this work, an inquiry on a strategic planning technique called Impact Mapping is performed and a unique combination of initial and follow-up materials is introduced to the reader. The technique is then analyzed through the problems that a PO faces in 2016, and conclusions are made on its compliance with the role and environment constraints.", "num_citations": "0\n", "authors": ["1546"]}
