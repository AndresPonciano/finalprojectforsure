The results reveal that, in identifying brand extensions, consumers take into account not only information about the product-level feature similarity between the new product and the products already associated with the brand, but also the concept consistency between the brand concept and the extension. For both function-oriented and prestige-oriented brand names, the most favorable reactions occur when brand extensions are made with high brand concept consistency and high product feature similarity. In addition, the relative impact of these two factors differs to some extent, depending on the nature of the brand-name concept.

We argue that by properly managing discretization bias and variance, we can effectively reduce naive-Bayes classification error. In particular, we propose proportional k-interval discretization and equal size discretization, two efficient heuristic discretization methods that are able to effectively manage discretization bias and variance by tuning discretized interval size and interval number. We empirically evaluate our new techniques against five key discretization methods for naive-Bayes classifiers.

One of the most-touted features of Web services is their capability to recursively construct a Web service as a workflow of other existing Web services. The quality of service (QoS) of Web-services-based workflows may be an essential determinant when selecting constituent Web services and determining the service-level agreement with users. To make such a selection possible, it is essential to estimate the QoS of a WS workflow based on the QoSs of its constituent WSs. In the context of WS workflow, this estimation can be made by a method called QoS aggregation. While most of the existing work on QoS aggregation treats the QoS as a deterministic value, we argue that due to some uncertainty related to a WS, it is more realistic to model its QoS as a random variable, and estimate the QoS of a WS workflow probabilistically.

Existing algorithms for mining associations, such as Apriori, will only discover itemsets that have support above a user-defined threshold. Any itemsets with support below the minimum support requirement are filtered out. We believe that an infrequent pair of items can be useful if the items are related indirectly via some other set of items. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for deriving indirectly associated itempairs and demonstrate the potential application of these patterns in the retail, textual and stock market domains.", "num_citations": "120\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

In such systems, it is essential to decluster database les into fragments and spread them across multiple disks so that the DBMS software can exploit the I/O bandwidth reading and writing the disks in parallel. In this paper, we consider the problem of declustering multidimensional data on a parallel disk system. Since the multidimensional range query is the main work-horse for applications accessing such data, our aim is to provide e cient support for it. A new declustering method for parallel disk systems, called coordinate modulo distribution (CMD), is proposed. Our analysis shows that the method achieves optimum parallelism for a very high percentage of range queries on multidimensional data, if the distribution of data on each dimension is stationary. We have derived the exact conditions under which optimality is achieved. Also provided are the worst and average case bounds on multidimensional range query performance. Experimental results show that the method achieves near optimum performance in almost all cases even when the stationarity assumption does not hold. Details of the parallel algorithms for range query processing and data maintenance are also provided.", "num_citations": "116\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

However, all these methods suffer from blocking which refers to documents wrongly rejected by the classifiers at higher-levels and cannot be passed to the classifiers at lower-levels. We propose a classifier-centric performance measure known as blocking factor to determine the extent of the blocking. Three methods are proposed to address the blocking problem, namely, threshold reduction, restricted voting, and extended multiplicative. Our experiments using support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on the Reuters collection have shown that they all could reduce blocking and improve the classification accuracy.

To model this behavior we include two latent psychological states of preference for items-sensitization and boredom. In the sensitization state the user is highly engaged with the item, while in the boredom state the user is disinterested.

A search heuristic that breaks the cycle by constructing the plan tree layer by layer in a bottom-up manner is proposed. To select nodes at the next level, the lower and upper bounds on the execution time for plans consistent with the decisions made so far are estimated and are used to guide the search.

{"title": "Correlations between community structure and link formation in complex networks\n", "abstract": " Background Links in complex networks commonly represent specific ties between pairs of nodes, such as protein-protein interactions in biological networks or friendships in social networks. However, understanding the mechanism of link formation in complex networks is a long standing challenge for network analysis and data mining.  Methodology/Principal Findings Links in complex networks have a tendency to cluster locally and form so-called communities. This widely existed phenomenon reflects some underlying mechanism of link formation. To study the correlations between community structure and link formation, we present a general computational framework including a theory for network partitioning and link probability estimation. Our approach enables us to accurately identify missing links in partially observed networks in an efficient way. The links having high connection likelihoods in the communities reveal that links are formed preferentially to create cliques and accordingly promote the clustering level of the communities. The experimental results verify that such a mechanism can be well captured by our approach.  Conclusions/Significance Our findings provide a new insight into understanding how links are created in the communities. The computational framework opens a wide range of possibilities to develop new approaches and applications, such as community detection and missing link prediction.", "num_citations": "61\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

It is very important not just to determine the veracity of information but also the authenticity of the users who spread the information, especially in time-critical situations like real-world emergencies, where urgent measures have to be taken for stopping the spread of fake information. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based approach for automatic identification of the users spreading rumorous information by leveraging the concept of believability, ie, the extent to which the propagated information is likely to be perceived as truthful, based on the trust measures of users in Twitter's retweet network. We hypothesize that the believability between two users is proportional to the trustingness of the retweeter and the trustworthiness of the tweeter, which are two\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "58\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

{"title": "Network size estimation in a peer-to-peer network\n", "abstract": " The emergence of peer-to-peer networks over the last decade has changed user's perspective about information available on the Web. But, with thousand of nodes joining and leaving a peer-to-peer network within a short span of time, it has become practically impossible for a node (or peer) to keep track of complete network. Often times, however, a node needs to at least have an estimate of number of nodes in such a network. For example, in determining time-to-live for a search query packet, a node must have a good estimate of network size. Previous deterministic approaches require a complete walk on the network, since such networks usually lack a central authority. Such approaches hence do not scale well to large networks. A few approaches, which collect partial information about the network, have been proposed as an alternative to address the scalability issues. This paper presents a novel approach for size estimation of a peer-to-peer network. The basic idea is to sample nodes in the network and then using this partial information about the network, an estimate of the network size is obtained using capture-recapture method. The capture-recapture method is a statistical method, which has been widely used for estimation of size of a closed population in oceanography and epidemiology. For a better estimate, the capture-recapture method requires two or more random (independent) samplings (sets of detected nodes) of the network. In our case, for independent sampling, we use random walks on the peer-to-peer network, since a random walk can achieve same statistical properties as independent samplings for a peer-to-peer network\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "49\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

{"title": "Pattern Directed Mining of Sequence Data.\n", "abstract": " Sequence data arise naturally in many applications, and can be viewed as an ordering of events, where each event has an associated time of occurrence. An important characteristic of event sequences is the occurrence of episodes, ie a collection of events occurring in a certain pattern. Of special interest are frequent episodes, ie episodes occurring with a frequency above a certain threshold. In this paper, we study the problem of mining for frequent episodes in sequence data. We present a framework for efficient mining of frequent episodes which goes beyond previous work in a number of ways. First, we present a language for specifying episodes of interest. Second, we describe a novel data structure, called the sequential pattern tree (SP Tree), which captures the relationships specified in the pattern language in a very compact manner. Third, we show how this data structure can be used by a standard bottom-up mining algorithm to generate frequent episodes in an efficient manner. Finally, we show how the SP Tree can be optimized by sharing common conditions, and evaluating each such expression only once. We present the results of an evaluation of the proposed techniques.", "num_citations": "40\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Therefore, in the case of a graph containing natural clusters, these algorithms do not differentiate between inter-cluster edges and intra-cluster edges. Based on this parameter, we propose a weighted inter-cluster edge ranking for clustered graphs that weighs edges (based on whether it is an inter-cluster or an intra-cluster edge) and nodes (based on the number of clusters it connects).

{"title": "Development of Trust Scores in Social Media (TSM) algorithm and application to advertising practice and research\n", "abstract": " Trust is an important factor, particularly in viral/social advertising, and computing trust scores for individual users of a social network is crucial for several applications in the advertising research and practice. However, research on trust in the advertising field has been limited, and the application of computational trust to advertising research using big data is rare. Addressing the gap in the research literature, this study proposed and empirically tested a new social media analytics method, the Trust Scores in Social Media (TSM) algorithm, for measuring individual users' trust levels in a social network. TSM proposes the concept of negatively reinforced trust scores and introduces two complementary measures of trust, trustingness, and trustworthiness. Another unique and important element in the TSM algorithm is the incorporation of trust-decision involvement to adjust trust scores depending on the level of trust-decision\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

There is an enormous incentive for development of a field through suitable EOR methods aimed at recovering some portion of the remaining oil.In recent years there has been an increasing interest in water alternating-gas (WAG) processes. For the fields reviewed, a common trend for the successful injections is an increased oil recovery in the range of 5 to 10% of the oil initially in place (OIIP). WAG injection is an oil recovery method initially aimed to improve sweep efficiency during gas injection. In some recent applications produced hydrocarbon gas has been reinjected in water injection wells with the aim of improving oil recovery and pressure maintenance. Oil recovery by WAG injection has been attributed to contact of upswept zones, especially recovery of attic or cellar oil by exploiting the segregation of gas to the top or the accumulating of water toward the bottom. Because the residual oil after gas flooding is normally lower than the residual oil after water flooding, and threephase zones may obtain lower remaining oil saturation, WAG injection has the potential for increased microscopic displacement efficiency. Thus, WAG injection can lead to improved oil recovery by combining better mobility control and contacting upswept zones, and by leading to improved microscopic displacement.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Now more than ever, it has become paramount to push the limits of online learning in every manner to keep flourishing the education system. One crucial component of online learning is Knowledge Tracing (KT). The aim of KT is to model student's knowledge level based on their answers to a sequence of exercises referred as interactions. Students acquire their skills while solving exercises and each such interaction has a distinct impact on student ability to solve a future exercise. This impact is characterized by 1) the relation between exercises involved in the interactions and 2) student forget behavior. Traditional studies on knowledge tracing do not explicitly model both the components jointly to estimate the impact of these interactions.

Though the relationship between sleep and physical activity is known to be important, it is not yet fully understood. The explosion in popularity of actigraphy and wearable devices, provides a unique opportunity to understand this relationship. Leveraging this information source requires new tools to be developed to facilitate data-driven research for sleep and activity patient-recommendations. In this paper we explore the use of deep learning to build sleep quality prediction models based on actigraphy data. We first use deep learning as a pure model building device by performing human activity recognition (HAR) on raw sensor data, and using deep learning to build sleep prediction models. We compare the deep learning models with those build using classical approaches, i.e. logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and adaboost. Secondly, we employ the advantage of deep learning with its ability to handle high dimensional datasets. We explore several deep learning models on the raw wearable sensor output without performing HAR or any other feature extraction. Our results show that using a convolutional neural network on the raw wearables output improves the predictive value of sleep quality from physical activity, by an additional 8% compared to state-of-the-art non-deep learning approaches, which itself shows a 15% improvement over current practice. Moreover, utilizing deep learning on raw data eliminates the need for data pre-processing and simplifies the overall workflow to analyze actigraphy data for sleep and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "26\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

{"title": "Distortion-free predictive streaming time-series matching\n", "abstract": " Efficient processing of streaming time-series generated by remote sensors and mobile devices has become an important research area. As in traditional time-series applications, similarity matching on streaming time-series is also an essential research issue. To obtain more accurate similarity search results in many time-series applications, preprocessing is performed on the time-series before they are compared. The preprocessing removes distortions such as offset translation, amplitude scaling, linear trends, and noise inherent in time-series. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for distortion-free predictive streaming time-series matching. Similarity matching on streaming time-series is saliently different from traditional time-series in that it is not feasible to directly apply the traditional algorithms for streaming time-series. Our algorithm is distortion-free in the sense that it performs preprocessing on streaming time\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Various kinds of parallelism possible in production systems are classified. Parallel execution of production systems leads to some subtle problems which, if not handled carefully, can cause altered execution semantics. The precise conditions that any parallel implementation of production systems must fulfil in order to be semantically consistent are identified. A mechanism that guarantees the semantic consistency of parallel execution and proves its correctness is presented. It is based on a novel locking mechanism that provides more parallelism than conventional two-phase locking. The various factors that can affect the actual speedup of a database production system are discussed.< >", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

In this work the problem of predicting collaborations is addressed while modeling the collaboration network as a hypergraph network. The problem of predicting future multi-actor collaboration is mapped to hyperedge prediction problem. Given that the higher order edge prediction is an inherently hard problem, in this work we restrict to the task of predicting edges (collaborations) that have already been observed in past. In this work, we propose a novel use of hyperincidence temporal tensors to capture time varying hypergraphs and provides a tensor decomposition based prediction algorithm. We quantitatively compare the performance of the hypergraphs based approach with the conventional dyadic graph based approach. Our hypothesis that hypergraphs preserve the information that simple graphs destroy is corroborated by experiments using author collaboration network from the DBLP dataset. Our results demonstrate the strength of hypergraph based approach to predict higher order collaborations (size>4) which is very difficult using dyadic graph based approach. Moreover, while predicting collaborations of size>2 hypergraphs in most cases provide better results with an average increase of approx. 45% in F-Score for different sizes = {3,4,5,6,7}.", "num_citations": "17\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Experimental results on the KDDCup\u201999 data set have demonstrated that our rare class predictive models are much more efficient in the detection of intrusive behavior than standard classification techniques. Experimental results on the DARPA 1998 data set, as well as on live network traffic at the University of Minnesota, show that the new techniques show great promise in detecting novel intrusions. In particular, during the past few months our techniques have been successful in automatically identifying several novel intrusions that could not be detected using state-of-the-art tools such as SNORT. In fact, many of these have been on the CERT/CC list of recent advisories and incident notes.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "Web mining\n", "abstract": " The ease and speed with which business transactions can be carried out over the Web has been a key driving force in the rapid growth of electronic commerce. In addition, customer interactions, including personalized content, e-mail campaigns, online customer service, and online surveys provide new channels of communication that were not previously available or were very inefficient. The Web is revolutionizing the way businesses interact with each other (B2B) and with each customer (B2C). It has introduced entirely new ways of doing commerce, including auctions and reverse auctions, micro-segmented offers, dynamic pricing, and up-to-date content. It also made it imperative for organizations and companies to optimize their electronic business.Knowledge about the customer is fundamental for the establishment of viable e-commerce solutions. As described by Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. com, and mentioned by Joseph Pine in his book The Experience Economy (Pine et al.), customer experience is the key to building customer loyalty in an on-line store because leaving the store is only one click away. Web mining for e-commerce is the application of mining techniques to acquire this knowledge for improving e-commerce. The use of mining techniques in e-commerce can help improve cross-sells, up-sells, assortments shown, ads shown. In addition, clickstream collection allows for unprecedented measurement of site activities, conversion rates, and the effect of action (Kohavi, 2001).", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

However, the Internet was not originally, designed for such isochronous traffic, and it is not clear that it is fully capable of providing the desired quality of service (QoS) for this application. We describe a number of QoS parameters to measure the perceptual quality of audio, including measures of delay, rate and loss. We investigate the factors influencing the QoS of Internet voice, such as packet period and packet size, threshold delay, buffer delay, time slots and Internet sites. We present results from our experiments on how these factors influence the QoS of Internet voice. Based on the results of our experiments, we propose a QoS driven dynamic scheduling algorithm for the real-time transmission of Internet voice packets.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

A detailed performance evaluation is carried out to see how various declustering schemes perform under a wide range of query and database scenarios (both relative to each other and to the optimal). Parameters that are varied include shape and size of queries, database size, number of attributes and the number of disks. The results show that information about common queries on a relation is very important and ought to be used in deciding the declustering for it, and that this is especially crucial for small queries. Also, there is no clear winner, and as such parallel database systems must support a number of declustering methods.< >", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Hence, predicting the condition of patients during their ICU stay can help provide better acute care and plan the hospital's resources. There has been continuous progress in machine learning research for ICU management, and most of this work has focused on using time series signals recorded by ICU instruments. In our work, we show that adding clinical notes as another modality improves the performance of the model for three benchmark tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, modeling decompensation, and length of stay forecasting that play an important role in ICU management. While the time-series data is measured at regular intervals, doctor notes are charted at irregular times, making it challenging to model them together.

As bot players can obtain unjustified assets without corresponding efforts, the gaming community does not allow players to use game bots. However, the task of identifying game bots is not an easy one because of the velocity and variety of their evolution in mimicking human behavior.

{"title": "Usage Aware PageRank.\n", "abstract": " Traditional link analysis approaches assume equal weights assigned to different links and pages. In original PageRank formulation, the user model assumes that the user has equal probability to follow each link from a given page, thus the score of a page equally affects all of the pages it points to. It also assumes that the probability for a user to go to a URL directly without following a link is the same for all URLs. In this paper, we investigate different weighting schemes that take into account the probability to go to a page directly (by typing or using bookmarks), as well as the relative probability to follow a link from a given page. Both of these probabilities can be approximated from usage logs if they are available. We introduce a natural extension to the original PageRank formulation that we will call Usage aware PageRank (UPR). The new formulation combines static link structure graph with the usage graph that will be obtained via web logs or other means. It is also quite general; how much emphasis will be given to the graphs is controlled by a parameter. If the parameter is set to zero, the algorithm becomes equivalent to the original PageRank, if it is set to one, the emphasis shifts to the usage graph, and for values in between, both of the graphs will be used with weights specified by the parameter. UPR is also quite inexpensive. After a onetime precalculation step, an iteration of UPR takes about the same time as a PageRank iteration.", "num_citations": "15\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "A web proxy server with an intelligent prefetcher for dynamic pages using association rules\n", "abstract": " The growth of the World Wide Web has emphasized the need for improved user latency. Primarily, two techniques, ie, caching and prefetching are being used for improving user latency. Several studies have been conducted on cache replacement policies for improving the cache hit ratio. On the prefetching side, studies have been conducted on prefetching models based on decision tree, Markov chain, and path analysis. Increasing use of dynamic pages, frequent changes in site structure, and user access patterns on the Internet have limited the efficacy of caching techniques and emphasized the need for prefetching with a predictive model which is easier to build and update and which has improved predictive performance. In this paper, we studied the existing caching and prefetching techniques and explored as to how the knowledge of user access patterns discovered through web mining and information on site structure can be used to predict future requests by user. In a web site, certain sets of pages exhibit strong correlations with each other, which manifest in user access patterns. Such sets of correlations can be discovered in the form of association rules by web mining of server logs. We accordingly propose a prefetching model based on association rules. We also present a predictive model based on site structure where a certain number of children of the current page are prefetched. In addition, we also present a design and prototype implementation of a proxy server which uses these models for prefetching as well as results of experiments to evaluate the performance of these two models.

The language based upon our model contains just three primitives for temporal specification of these relations. Using them we can express the temporal relations of the sixteen models studied, and we can further express several relations that cannot be specified by these models.

Sleep disorders like sleep apnea are increasing in prevalence, with the rapid increase in factors like obesity. Sleep apnea is most commonly treated with Continuous Positive Air Pressure (CPAP) therapy. Presently, however, there is no mechanism to monitor a patient's progress with CPAP. Accurate detection of sleep stages from CPAP flow signal is crucial for such a mechanism. We propose, for the first time, an automated sleep staging model based only on the flow signal.

The recent growth of Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data which enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2 game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious barrier of requiring goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "Social capital: the power of influencers in networks\n", "abstract": " The problem of finding the influencers in social networks has been traditionally dealt in an optimization setting by finding the top-k nodes that has the maximum information spread in the network. These methods aim to find the influencers in a network through the process of information diffusion. However, none of these approaches model the individual social value generated by collaborations in these networks. Such social value is often the real motivation for which the nodes connect to each other. In this work, we propose a framework to compute this network social value using the concept of social capital, namely the amount of bonding and bridging connections in the network. We first compute the social capital value of the network and then allocate this network value to the nodes of the network. We establish the fairness of our allocation using several axioms of fairness. Our experiments on the real data sets show that the computed social capital is an excellent proxy for finding influencers and our approach outperforms several popular baselines.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

The former approach assumes statistical independence of individual components, while the latter assumes substantial global systemic correlation. As a compromise between these two epistemological extremes, we present a data-mining approach hybridizing existing statistical techniques with theorem-proving methods to create a novel algorithm for anomaly detection, diagnosis and control in complex systems. Our algorithm takes sensor inputs from physical sensors providing system subcomponent performance data and outputs (i) a global systemic risk indicator and (ii) possible diagnosis hypotheses. We present results on three different systems, and in comparison with current state-of-the-art fault detection algorithms to demonstrate the viability of our approach. We find that our algorithm proves robust towards increased data dimensionality in contrast with existing clustering-based fault detection methods and can also detect contextual faults that are undetectable using existing statistical techniques.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

While these approaches were separately pursued, we show their connection to each other in this paper. We begin by describing the affordance of absence, inspired by insights on affordances arising from a lack of resources. For example, in the absence of specialized tools, more general tools are used to accomplish similar tasks. Such absence clarifies how other tools could be modified to add relevant features and identifies critical features of the absent tool. In addition, the temporary removal of physical features and objects enables user interaction in ways that may not emerge in their presence. Affordance of absence has the potential to more fully specify affordances for a given object and to help overcome functional fixedness\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

This paper presents dSENSE: a  data-driven approach for energy management in sensor platforms. dSENSE is a node-level power  management approach that utilizes knowledge of the underlying data streams as well as application data quality requirements to conserve energy on a sensor node. dSENSE employs sense-on-change---a sampling strategy that aggressively conserves power by reducing sensing activity on the sensor node. Unlike most existing energy management techniques, this strategy enables explicit control of the sensor along with the CPU and the radio. Our approach uses an efficient statistical data stream model to predict future sensor readings. These predictions are coupled with a stochastic scheduling algorithm to dynamically control the operating modes of the sensor node components.  Using experimental results obtained on PowerTOSSIM with a real-world data trace, we demonstrate that our approach reduces energy consumption by 29-36% while providing strong statistical guarantees on data quality.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "Estimation of false negatives in classification\n", "abstract": " In many classification problems such as spam detection and network intrusion, a large number of unlabeled test instances are predicted negative by the classifier However, the high costs as well as time constraints on an expert's time prevent further analysis of the \"predicted false\" class instances in order to segregate the false negatives from the true negatives. A systematic method is thus required to obtain an estimate of the number of false negatives. A capture-recapture based method can be used to obtain an ML-estimate of false negatives when two or more independent classifiers are available. In the case for which independence does not hold, we can apply log-linear models to obtain an estimate of false negatives. However, as shown in this paper, lesser the dependencies among the classifiers, better is the estimate obtained for false negatives. Thus, ideally independent classifiers should be used to estimate\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

The rst phase focuses on assisting users to construct a consistent temporal relationship speci cation. The second phase ensures that the actual presentation proceeds according to the consistent temporal relationship speci cation despite dynamic factors such as resource contention. The use of Synchronization Relation Tree (SRT) as a formal temporal relationship speci cation to capture the temporal information is proposed. Consistency checks can be performed on the SRT during the speci cation phase.

The recent growth of Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs) has provided unprecedented access to large-scale data which enables us to study such complex human behavior in a more systematic manner. In this paper, we consider three different networks in the EverQuest2 game: chat, trade, and trust. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious barrier of requiring more goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier for such connections because they require faith in the players that are granted such high access. In general, we observe that reciprocation rate is inversely related to the barrier level in these networks. We also note that reciprocation has connections across the heterogeneous networks. Our experiments indicate that players make use of the medium-barrier reciprocations to strengthen a relationship. We hypothesize that lower-barrier interactions are an important component to predicting higher-barrier ones. We verify our hypothesis using predictive models for trust reciprocations using features from trade interactions.

The reaction shows first order kinetics with respect to NBS and Rh(III) in the oxidation of both the amino acids. The first order kinetics with respect to amino acid obtained at its lower concentration changes to zero order at its higher concentration. Inverse fractional order with respect to [H+] was obtained in Rh(III)-catalysed oxidation of gly and val. Variation in [Hg(II)], [NHS], [Cl-], ionic strength and dielectric constant of the medium has no effect on the rate of oxidation of both the amino acids. NBS itself and [RhCl5(H2O)]2- have been postulated as the reactive species of NBS and Rh(III) chloride in acidic medium, respectively. Various activation parameters have been calculated with the pseudo-first-order rate constant values observed at four different temperatures.

However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy tags from the set of candidate new tags.

{"title": "Community detection with prior knowledge\n", "abstract": " The problem of community detection is a challenging one because of the presence of hubs and noisy links, which tend to create highly imbalanced graph clusters. Often, these resulting clusters are not very intuitive and difficult to interpret. With the growing availability of network information, there is a significant amount of prior knowledge available about the communities in social, communication and several other networks. These community labels may be noisy and very limited, though they do help in community detection. In this paper, we explore the use of such noisy labeled information for finding high quality communities. We will present an adaptive density-based clustering which allows flexible incorporation of prior knowledge in to the community detection process.

{"title": "An empirical study of applying ensembles of heterogeneous classifiers on imperfect data\n", "abstract": " Two factors that slow down the deployment of classification or supervised learning in real-world situations. One is the reality that data are not perfect in practice, while the other is the fact that every technique has its own limits. Although there have been techniques developed to resolve issues about imperfectness of real-world data, there is no single one that outperforms all others and each such technique focuses on some types of imperfectness. Furthermore, quite a few works apply ensembles of heterogeneous classifiers to such situations. In this paper, we report a work on progress that studies the impact of heterogeneity on ensemble, especially focusing on the following aspects: diversity and classification quality for imbalanced data. Our goal is to evaluate how introducing heterogeneity into ensemble influences its behavior and performance.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

This paper proposes a novel approach to expand the Web graph to incorporate conceptual information encoded by links (anchor text) between Web pages. Using Web graph link structure and conceptual information associated with each Web page (automatically extracted from anchor text of Minks), a new graph is defined where each node represents a unique pair of a Web page and concept associated with that Web page, and an edge represents an explicit or implicit link between two such nodes. This graph captures inter-concept relationships, which is then utilized by ranking algorithms.

In this paper, we present a 2-step entity identification process in which attributes for matching tuples may be missing in certain tuples, and thus need to be derived prior to the matching. To match tuples, we require identity rules which specify the conditions to be satisfied by a pair of tuples, from different databases, before they can be considered as modeling the same real-world entity. We also introduce ILFD's (instance-level functional dependencies) as a form of inference rules which derive the missing identifying attributes. In order to provide more interesting integrated results to the users, we allow both identity rules and ILFD's to contain indefiniteness represented as necessary and possible support information.

The first generation of DM research and development has yielded several commercially available systems, both stand-alone and integrated with database systems; produced scalable versions of algorithms for many classical DM problems; and introduced novel pattern discovery problems. In recent years, research has tended to be fragmented into several distinct pockets without a comprehensive framework. Researchers have continued to work largely within the parameters of their parent disciplines, building upon existing and distinct research methodologies. Even when they address a common problem (for example, how to cluster a dataset) they apply different techniques, different perspectives on what the important issues are, and different evaluation criteria. While different approaches can be complementary, and such a diversity is ultimately a strength of the field, better communication across disciplines is required if DM is to forge a distinct identity with a core set of principles, perspectives, and challenges that differentiate it from each of the parent disciplines. Further, while the amount and complexity of data continues to grow rapidly, and the task of distilling useful insight continues to be central, serious concerns have emerged about social implications of DM. Addressing these concerns will require advances in our theoretical understanding of the principles that underlie DM algorithms, as well as an integrated approach to security and privacy in all phases of data management and analysis.

{"title": "Streams\n", "abstract": " With the growing popularity of the Internet, there is increasing interest in using it for audio and video transmission. Periodic network overloads, leading to bursty packet losses, have always been a key problem for network researchers. In a long-haul, heterogeneous network like the Internet, handling such an error becomes especially difficult. Perceptual studies of audio and video viewing have shown that bursty losses have the most annoying effect on people, and hence are critical issues to be addressed for applications such as Internet phone, video conferencing, distance learning, etc. Classical error handling techniques have focused on applications like FTP, and are geared towards ensuring that the transmission is correct, with no attention to timeliness. For isochronous traffic like audio and video, timeliness is a key criterion, and given the high degree of content redundancy, some loss of content is quite acceptable. In this paper we introduce the concept of error spreading, which is a transformation technique that takes the input sequence of packets (from an audio or video stream) and scrambles its packet before transmission. The packets are unscrambled at the receiving end. The transformation is designed to ensure that bursty losses in the transformed domain get spread all over the sequence in the original domain. Perceptual studies have shown that users are much more tolerant of a uniformly distributed loss of low magnitude. We next describe a continuous media transmission protocol based on this idea, and validate its performance through an experiment performed on the Internet. 1", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Using our policy, we could increase the number of simultaneously running clients that could be supported and could ensure a good response ratio and better resource utilization under heavy traffic requirements.

{"title": "Retrieval techniques for compressed video streams\n", "abstract": " A number of applications require audio and video data. Access to such data requires continuous real-time stream flow during playback (recording). This requires scheduling access to storage devices for such data. The high volume of such streams, especially video, makes it necessary to store them using compression schemes like JPEG and MPEG. However, doing so introduces playback data rate variability which in turn leads to poor storage system utilization if playback guarantees are to be maintained. Not all applications require perfect playback, and some tardiness and discontinuity during playback, within limits of acceptable Quality of Service (QoS), is tolerated. In this paper we briefly describe solutions to two problems that arise in scheduling the retrieval of compressed streams from secondary storage. Firstly, we propose QBSCAN, a scheme which reserves I/O bandwidth based on statistical estimates of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Moreover, the magic word QoS (Quality of Service) causes other difficulties. Most of the QoS metrics known so far assume that the communication channel is lossless.

Here, we explore this phenol-water system to get crucial information on ionic liquids (ILs). Comparative studies on the effect of high melting salts, micelles and ionic liquids (ILs) reveal interesting facts: while normal high melting salts such as KCl, CsCl and ionic surfactants (above and below critical micelle concentration (CMC)) show only an enhancement of critical solution temperature (CST) along with no substantial change in the shape of phase diagram, TX-100 shows an interesting trend. Below CMC, TX-100 shows normal trend while complete deviation is observed above CMC. When IL is added at various concentrations in the phenol-water system, the concentration-dependent effect on the phase diagram is observed. While at the low concentration, it follows the normal trend, at higher concentration phase diagram deviates drastically. The concentration at which this deviation is observed is termed here as Critical Ionic Liquid Aggregation Concentration (CILAC). Above CILAC, ILs exert an effect that resembles the effect of TX-100 micelles in the phenol-water phase diagram. Viscosity measurements of the system substantiate these data. Based on our observations, we propose that imidazolium chloride ILs constitute elliptical aggregates similar to TX-100 (having\u223c 300 \u00c5 length) in solution above CILAC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the possible shape and size of ILs aggregation in solution.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Especially with the web corpus deluged with digital documents, automation of this task is of prime importance. Keyword assignment is a broad topic of research which refers to tagging of document with keywords, key-phrases or topics. For text documents, the keyword assignment techniques have been developed under two sub-topics: automatic keyword extraction (AKE) and automatic key-phrase abstraction. However, the approaches developed in the literature for full text documents cannot be used to assign keywords to low text content documents like twitter feeds, news clips, product reviews or even short scholarly text. In this work, we point out several practical challenges encountered in tagging such low text content documents. As a solution to these challenges, we show that the proposed approaches which leverage knowledge from several open source web resources enhance the quality of the tags (keywords) assigned to the low text content documents. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on real world corpus consisting of scholarly documents with text content ranging from only the text in the title of the document (5-10 words) to the summary text/abstract (100- 150 words). We find that the proposed approach not just improves the accuracy of keyword assignment but offer a computationally efficient solution which can be used in real world applications.", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

In case of Pusa isolate of T. viride, T. harzianum and T. virens, the radial growth of C. gloeosporioides were 19.7, 19.3 and 20.7 mm, respectively whereas New Delhi isolates T. viride, T. harzianum and T. virens produced 28.7 mm, 24.7 mm and 22.3 mm radial growth, of the test fungus, respectively. T. harzianum (RAU, Pusa isolate) was found to be best to inhibit the radial growth (19.3 mm) of C. gloeosporioides. It was closely followed by T. viride (19.7 mm) of RAU, Pusa isolate.

{"title": "Modeling Trust in Online Social Networks to Improve Adolescent Health Behavior\n", "abstract": " One of the major public health findings in recent years has been the discovery of the strong impact of an individual's social network on the individual's health as well as habits. A number of studies have shown that physical health factors such as obesity, emotional health factors such as happiness, and habits such as smoking and exercise are significantly impacted by the individual's social network. Based on this, there has been increasing interest in the application of network theory and system dynamics to the study of public health. Among a range of public health issues, adolescent health is particularly important for a number of reasons. First, given their developmental stage, adolescents are particularly sensitive to, and impacted by, their social networks. Second, many lifelong health habits or risk behaviors are established during adolescence (eg cigarette smoking, alcohol use). Third, adolescents represent the future workforce of the nation, thus their long-term health is critically important for the economy. This makes it especially important to study the impact of social networks on adolescent health. While the invention of the Internet, Web, mobile phones and personal digital assistants have revolutionized many walks of life, the most relevant to our present discussion is the creation of various online social networking sites (eg Facebook, MySpace, Twitter). These sites allow new forms of person-to-person interactions, with negligible cost, low latency, and high bandwidth; with the overall effect being one of dramatically increasing the intensity and continuity of communication between people.

Increasing use of dynamic pages, frequent changes in site structure, and user access patterns on the Internet have limited the efficacy of caching techniques and emphasized the need for prefetching. Since prefetching increases bandwidth, it is important that the prediction model be highly accurate and computationally feasible. It has been observed that in a web environment, certain sets of pages exhibit stronger correlations than others, a fact which can be used to predict future requests. In the past, studies have been conducted on predictive models based on TOP-N and pairwise interactions. In this paper we study a prefetching model based on association rules of data mining where page interactions of higher order are used to determine set relationships among pages.

In this paper, since we use UDP for CM data transmission, we adopt a new QoS metric that is applicable to lossy streams to evaluate the performance of our CM server. To reduce QoS loss factors and drift factors, we adopt a new strategy, called the QoS-driven dropping mechanism, for the CM server.

Therefore, there has been an increasing demand for ubiquitous computing environments to support a certain degree of quality of service (QoS) to meet various service requirements from different computing and networking applications, and to better utilize the computing resources. However, supporting QoS in the ubiquitous computing environments has also raised great concerns regarding the applicability of any QoS solution. Management of such ubiquitous multimedia applications requires new mechanisms, i.e., Soft-QoS framework, to be developed for admission control, negotiation, allocation, and scheduling.

{"title": "A comparative study of anomaly detection schemes in network intrusion detection\n", "abstract": " Intrusion detection corresponds to a suite of techniques that can be used to identify attacks against computers and network infrastructures. Anomaly detection is a key element of intrusion detection systems in which perturbations of normal behavior suggest the presence of intentionally or unintentionally induced attacks, faults, defects, etc. Several recently developed anomaly and outlier detection schemes have been proposed for detecting novel attacks whose nature is unknown. To benefit the anomaly detection framework, a procedure for extracting additional useful features is also implemented. In addition, evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms is performed using standard metrics as well as specific metrics that are especially suitable in detecting intrusions that involve multiple network connections. The detailed comparison of anomaly detection algorithms applied to DARPA 1998 Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data demonstrate that depending on the attack type some anomaly detection schemes are more successful in detecting novel anomalies than others. However, during the past few months the most prominent techniques have also been applied to real network data, and they have been very successful in automatically identifying several novel intrusions, which were at the same time reported by CERT(Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center) for additional investigation, since state-of-the-art intrusion detection techniques could not detect them.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

The emergence of parallel I/O architectures has made the problem of data declustering, ie fragmenting a le of records and allocating the pieces to different disks, one of prime importance. This is evident from the growing activity in this area. In this study we focus only on multi-attribute declustering methods which are based on some type of grid-based partitioning of the data space. Since the multidimensional range query is the main workhorse for applications accessing such data, the focus is to provide e cient support for it. We rst show that there exists no declustering method that is strictly optimal for range queries if the number of disks is greater than 5. Thus the focus is on using declustering methods which provides good average case performance and are also optimal for a large class of queries. A class of multidimensional declustering methods, called Latin Hypercubes, is proposed. Conditions under which this class is optimal are derived. Also provided are the worst case and average case bounds on multidimensional range query performance. A detailed experimental evaluation is carried out to see how the class compares with other declustering methods. Parameters that are varied are shape and size of queries, database size, number of attributes and the number of disks.

The hill is approached from Parasnath railway station by two routes, one via Madhuban on the northern side of the hill and the other via Nimiaghat on the eastern side of the hill. The first route is fre quented by a large number of pilgrims who come during the winter from all over India, halt in the dharamshalas at Madhuban, and from there climb up the hill. The other route is used by the government officers, tourists, etc., who want to stay in the dak-bungalows at Nimiaghat and at the top (please see the attached map). The climb up the hill is about 6 miles from either side, the path being fairly steep by the Madhuban route. After a climb of about 4 miles by this route, the path bifurcates, one goes due south to Jal-Mandir where the devotees bathe before visiting the shrines, the second one goes south-west to the dak-bungalow.

It is not a trivial task to understand their impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic health records (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid increase in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant new data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-time through web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider, potentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g., sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This is a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare decision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a new opportunity to overcome this barrier. To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a major fraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose a novel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning technique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account the co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity patterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost the performance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, since many disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as co-morbidity, we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared structure of disorder inducing life-style choices partially captured in the wearables data.

Overall, the most highly predictive, interpretable model has an f-measure of 0.94 and suggests the primary character gender and number of male and female characters a player has provide the most prediction value, with players choosing characters to match their own gender. The results also suggest that female players craft, scribe recipes, and harvest items more than male players. While the strength of these\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

{"title": "A multi-step framework for detecting attack scenarios\n", "abstract": " With growing dependence upon interconnected networks, defending these networks against intrusions is becoming increasingly important. In the case of attacks that are composed of multiple steps, detecting the entire attack scenario is of vital importance. In this paper, we propose an analysis framework that is able to detect these scenarios with little predefined information. The core of the system is the decomposition of the analysis into two steps: first detecting a few events in the attack with high confidence, and second, expanding from these events to determine the remainder of the events in the scenario. Our experiments show that we can accurately identify the majority of the steps contained within the attack scenario with relatively few false positives. Our framework can handle sophisticated attacks that are highly distributed, try to avoid standard pre-defined attack patterns, use cover traffic or \"noisy\" attacks to distract analysts and draw attention away from the true attack, and attempt to avoid detection by signature-based schemes through the use of novel exploits or mutation engines.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "Estimating missed actual positives using independent classifiers\n", "abstract": " Data mining is increasingly being applied in environments having very high rate of data generation like network intrusion detection [7], where routers generate about 300,000--500,000 connections every minute. In such rare class data domains, the cost of missing a rare-class instance is much higher than that of other classes. However, the high cost for manual labeling of instances, the high rate at which data is collected as well as real-time response constraints do not always allow one to determine the actual classes for the collected unlabeled datasets. In our previous work [9], this problem of missed false negatives was explained in context of two different domains--\" network intrusion detection\" and\" business opportunity classification\". In such cases, an estimate for the number of such missed high-cost, rare instances will aid in the evaluation of the performance of the modeling technique (eg classification) used.

The ore was predominantly made up of spahlerite and pyrite in association with subordinate amounts of galena, minor amounts of pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Dolomite was the main gangue. The modal analysis showed the probability of fair liberation of sulphides from gangues around 60 mesh but the locking of galena with sphalerite and other sulphides continued to finer sizes. The effects of various parameters like granulomery for rougher and cleaner flotation, pH of the pulp, dosage of collector, depressant and activator were studied in detail.

However, both representation schemes have a critical problem in that they represent each icon object of an original image as a point.

{"title": "Parametric Evaluation of Performance Behavior in Hierarchical Storage Architecture\n", "abstract": " In this article, we investigate lhe performance behavior of a hierarchical storage architecture. Considering both the size of video files and the skewed file access patterns over the available files, it is not cost-effective to store all video files on secondary storage such as disk arrays, since most users may access only a small subset of the available video files. Using tertiary storage, such as a tape library, is a promising solution for achieving the desired cost effectiveness. Though a hierarchical storage structure is desirable, an unbalanced configuration of the storage hierarchy may result in waste of resources and thus degrade overall server throughput. Our effort is focused on investigating the effect of the various system parameters to obtain an optimal configuration of the hierarchical storage. Throughput of the server is defined along with two orthogonal performance metrics, namely expected service rime and system congestion and blocking probability. We establish an analytical formulation for the given performance metrics. Hierarchical storage performance is governed by several factors such as user-access pattern, number of tape drives, capacity of secondary storage, transfer rate of tape drives, and transfer rate of disks. It is observed that speeding up the rate of data transfer may in some cases increase the blocking probability and hence degrade overall server performance. We use a queuing model to obtain an analytical formulation of the server's performance. This enables us to investigate the effects of different configurations of the storage hierarchy and different data access patterns; it also provides a framework to determine the optimal\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Our approach starts by transforming a query tree, such as might be generated by a sequential optimizer, into an operator tree which is then partitioned into a forest of linear chains of pipelined operators. We present an algorithm for scheduling these chains in conformance to their precedence ordering on a parallel machine. The aim of the scheduling is to achieve some objective like minimum response time or maximum speedup, etc. We provide a set of experiments to demonstrate the quality of the allocation plans generated by the method. A major benefit of the method is that it uses inter-operator, intra-operator and pipelining methods of parallelizing relational query operators simultaneously. Our experiments show that the heuristic scheduling method creates schedules that are close to optimal while being very easy to compute.

{"title": "Designing an I/O Scheduler for Continuous Media\n", "abstract": " A growing set of multi-media applications require continuous ow of high volume data, eg video and audio, that can wholly reside only in secondary (and possibly tertiary) storage devices. Additionally, data accessed by such applications have temporal relationships that must be maintained at storage and retrieval time. In order to provide such high volume data in real-time large investment in secondary storage devices and mechanisms is necessary. In order to provide economical access to such data specialized storage servers called Continuous Media (CM) servers must be shared by a large community of users. In this paper we discuss the design of an I/O scheduler that schedules synchronized access to continuous media in realtime from secondary storage devices. To schedule multiple accesses to the storage server, we describe a control system model for a class of cyclical schedulers for continuous media that guarantee data rate. This model is then used to explore di erent trade-o s like the bu er space and slack time. Con guration issues like main memory requirements and control policies like admission control are then quantitatively analyzed. In addition to simultaneously accessing data, users will execute operations like Play and FastPlay that require data at varying rates, and FastForward and FastReverse operations that require data in a sequence that is di erent from the original recording. In order to implement such VCR-like operations without a ecting data rate guarantees requires a gradual build up of data until a time when it is safe enough to e ect them.

The reaction shows first order kinetics with respect to [IO4\u2013],[D-xylose] and [OH\u2013] at their low concentrations and tends towards zero order kinetics at their higher concentrations. A direct proportionality between the rate and concentration of Ir (III) chloride was observed throughout its 10-fold variation. Negligible effects of [Cl\u2013] and ionic strength (\u00b5) of the medium were observed on pseudo-first order rate constant. Pseudo-first order rate constants measured at different temperatures in the oxidation of D-xylose were used to calculate entropy of activation and other relevant activation parameters.

{"title": "Predictive overlapping co-clustering\n", "abstract": " In the past few years co-clustering has emerged as an important data mining tool for two way data analysis. Coclustering is more advantageous over traditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as, ability to find highly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of the overlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract meaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. For example, building predictive models with high dimensional data and heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such data, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more accurate predictive model building. Several applications such as finding patient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in recommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from co-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to generate co-clusters for improved data analysis.In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping Co-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and improved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by maximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on the number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and f-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters.

{"title": "Role of Computational Trust Models in Service Science\n", "abstract": " With the proliferation of online communities and Person-to-Person (P2P) online service markets, the deployment of knowledge, skills, experiences and user generated contents services are generally facilitated among service users and service providers. In online service markets where well-established intermediaries are often eliminated, the success of social interactions for service exchange among completely unknown users depends on'trust'of a service user for a service provider. Therefore, providing a satisfactory trust model to evaluate the quality of services and to recommend personalized trustworthy service providers is vital for a successful online community and P2P online service market. However, finding trustworthy service providers for each individual user is challenging because of the lack of direct experiences and the subjective property of trust. In order to resolve the challenges, current research on trust prediction strongly relies on a web of trust, which is directly collected from users. However, the web of trust is not always available in online communities and, even when it is available, it is often too sparse to accurately predict the trust value between two unacquainted people. In this paper, we propose a computational trust model to predict trust connectivity based on service providers' expertise (local trust from direct experiences and a reputation) and service users' affinity for certain contexts (topics). The approach used item rating data that is available and much more dense than direct trust data. In experiments with a real-world dataset, we show that our model can predict trust connectivity with a high degree of accuracy. The proposed\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

The large scale of such graphs in real world, such as the World Wide Web has given rise to computing challenges of such measures. In this paper, we address the challenges of computing such First-order Markov measure, considering PageRank as the example of such a measure. We address two challenging computational scenarios for PageRank: (a) computation for a large single graph at a given time instance and (b) incremental computation for large evolving graphs. We achieve efficiency by reducing the problem size and reducing the number of iterations to compute. For (a) we bin the nodes in different partitions and for the subgraph formed by each of these partitions we use the nature of the firstorder Markov model to break down the problem of computation. For (b) we propose a method to accommodate the changed edges and nodes into new partitions and existing partitions and identify the subset of partitions for which recomputation is necessary. For each identified partition we use an incremental approach to compute the measure in expedited manner. Our results show significant reduction in time for computing for our approaches to both these problems.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

This paper presents PSS an energy-efficient stochastic sensing framework for wireless sensor platforms. PSS is a node-level framework that utilizes knowledge of the underlying data streams as well as application data quality requirements to conserve energy on a sensor node. PSS employs a stochastic scheduling algorithm to dynamically control the operating modes of the sensor node components. This scheduling algorithm enables an adaptive sampling strategy that aggressively conserves power by adjusting sensing activity to the application requirements. Using experimental results obtained on Power-TOSSIM with a real-world data trace, we demonstrate that our approach reduces energy consumption by 29-36 while providing strong statistical guarantees on data quality.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Particularly, convergence of various technological factors, namely in network access and in video coding and transmission, have recently brought a rapid growth of interest in on-line access to multimedia services. The problem of largescale provision of services has several implications for the design of a storage server. Voluminous nature of a multimedia file is one of the primary reasons which makes the design of the server non trivial. With MPEG-2 compression technique a movie file of 110 min length requires more than 3 G bytes of storage space. Storing thousands of files of this size on a disk subsystem requires huge amounts of disk space. According to user surveys [7], file-access frequency is strictly biased in favor of a small number of popular titles, while the rest of the files are rarely accessed in commercial video rental. This characteristic of the user-access pattern enables the storage architecture designer to exploit the hierarchical storage structure in managing a large volume of information. The advantage of using hierarchical storage architecture is to exploit the popularity or hotness of a file and assign space the appropriate storage hierarchy to each file, thereby maximizing the cost-performance ratio. The efficiency of hierarchical storage architecture is maximized when the capacity of each hierarchy is well balanced and the behavior of each storage hierarchy is well harmonized.

{"title": "A Tree-Decomposition Approach to Parallel Query Optimization\n", "abstract": " In this paper we present an approach for transforming a relational join tree into a detailed execution plan with resource allocation information, for execution on a parallel machine. Our approach starts by transforming a query tree, such as might be generated by a sequential optimizer, into an operator tree which is then partitioned into a forest of linear chains of pipelined operators. We present an algorithm for scheduling these chains in conformance to their precedence ordering on a parallel machine. The aim of the scheduling is to achieve some objective like minimum response time or maximum speedup, etc. We provide a set of experiments to demonstrate the quality of the allocation plans generated by the method. A major benefit of the method is that it uses inter-operator, intra-operator and pipelining methods of parallelizing relational query operators simultaneously. Our experiments show that the heuristic scheduling method creates schedules that are close to optimal while being very easy to compute. We also propose a new way to calculate speedup that takes into account the amount of work that is done.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "Efficient rule matching in large scale rule based systems\n", "abstract": " The paper presents an efficient rule matching algorithm for a large scale production system. The matching algorithm is state saving and does incremental evaluation. Implementation details are presented which include optimization of join tests, and efficient buffering of data blocks. A cost analysis, both in terms of matching evaluation cost and storage cost for the saved state is presented. Results from the performance study show that substantial savings in matching cost are obtained with little space overhead for the saving state. Matching becomes computationally intensive in a secondary memory environment, and efficient algorithms are a must for successful integration of production systems and databases. The authors show how the OPS5 and relational model are compatible, and thus implementation techniques in one domain are applicable to the other.< >", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

{"title": "Precision-time tradeoffs: A paradigm for processing statistical queries on databases\n", "abstract": " Conventional query processing techniques are aimed at queries which access small amounts of data, and require each data item for the answer. In case the database is used for statistical analysis as well as operational purposes, for some types of queries a large part of the database may be required to compute the answer. This may lead to a data access bottleneck, caused by the excessive number of disk accesses needed to get the data into primary memory. An example is computation of statistical parameters, such as count, average, median, and standard deviation, which are useful for statistical analysis of the database. Yet another example that faces this bottleneck is the verification of the truth of a set of predicates (goals), based on the current database state, for the purposes of intelligent decision making.

Here we show a methodology to predict, at individual-level, future therapy adherence for patients receiving daily injections of growth hormone (GH) therapy for GH deficiency. Our proposed model is able to generate predictions of future adherence using a recurrent neural network with adherence data recorded by easypodTM, a connected autoinjection device. The model was trained with a multi-year long dataset with 2500 patients, from January 2007 to June 2019. When testing, the model reached an average sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.88 per patient when predicting non-adherence (< 85%) periods. When evaluated with thousands of therapy segments extracted from a test set, our model reached an AUC-PR score of 0.79 and AUC-ROC of 0.90; both metrics were consistently better than traditional approaches, such as simple average model. Using this model, we can perform precise early identification of patients who are likely to become non-adherent patients.

With their increasing popularity, researchers are realizing that video games can be a means to fully observe an entire isolated universe. Each action is logged, and the level of granularity and completeness with which information is collected is unmatched by any real-life experimental setup. They serve as unprecedented tools to theorize and empirically model the social and behavioral dynamics of individuals, groups, and networks within large communities.    Virtual world applications usually have a thin-client architecture, practically all user actions are captured in the click-stream logged at the server. This dataset contains a comprehensive record of every user's in-network activities, accomplishments, interactions, economic status, etc. A brief record of the user's side information (i.e. profile data) is also stored. It is common for popular social networking and collaborative systems to have hundreds of thousands of users generating copious amounts of data based on the many different activities they are participating in at any given time. The data also has a temporal component which is often an integral part of the analysis and introduces further relationships that must be accounted for.

Third, we introduce cost-sensitive learning to the classification algorithms and show that the inclusion of cost-sensitive learning leads to improved prediction accuracy. The built predictive models can be used to allocate health care resources to individuals. It is expected to help reduce the cost of health care resource allocation and provisioning and thereby allow countries and communities lacking the ability to afford high health care cost to provide health indices (coverage), provide individuals with health index which takes into consideration their overall health and thereby improve quality of individual health assessment (quality), and improve reliability of decision making by focusing on a set of objective criteria for all individuals (reliability).", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

Increasing use of dynamic pages, frequent changes in site structure, and user access patterns on the internet have limited the efficacy of caching techniques and emphasized the need for prefetching. Since prefetching increases bandwidth, it is important that the prediction model is highly accurate and computationally feasible. It has been observed that in a web environment, certain sets of pages exhibit stronger correlations than others, a fact which can be used to predict future requests. Previous studies on predictive models are mainly based on pair interactions of pages and TOP-N approaches. In this paper we study a model based on page interactions of higher order where we exploit set relationships among the pages of a web site. We also compare the performance of this approach with the models based on pairwise interaction and the server log and five synthetic logs with varying page frequency distributions to simulate different real life web sites and identified dominance zones for each of these models.

{"title": "Error Spreading: A Perception-Driven Approach Orthogonal to Error Handling in Continuous Media Streaming\n", "abstract": " With the growing popularity of the Internet, there is increasing interest in using it for audio and video transmission. Periodic network overloads, leading to bursty packet losses, have always been a key problem for network researchers. In a long-haul, heterogeneous network like the Internet, handling such an error becomes especially difficult. Perceptual studies of  audio and video viewing have shown that bursty losses have the most annoying effect on people, and hence are critical issues to be addressed for  applications such as Internet phone, video conferencing,  distance learning, etc.  Classical error handling techniques have focused on applications like FTP, and are geared towards ensuring that the transmission is correct, with no attention to timeliness. For isochronous traffic like audio and video, timeliness is a key criterion, and given the high degree of content redundancy, some loss of content is quite acceptable. In this paper we introduce the concept of error spreading, which is a transformation technique that takes the input sequence of packets (from an audio or video stream) and scrambles its packets before transmission. The packets are unscrambled at the receiving end. The transformation is designed to ensure that bursty losses in the transformed domain get spread all over the sequence in the original domain.  Our error spreading idea deals with either cases where the stream has or does not have inter-frame dependencies.  Perceptual studies have shown that users are much more tolerant of a uniformly distributed loss of low magnitude. We next describe a continuous media transmission protocol based on this idea.

In order to achieve this Multiple Query Optimization (MQO) identifies common task (s)(eg common subexpressions, joins, etc.) among a set of query plans and creates a single unified plan (multi-plan) which can be executed to obtain the required outputs for all queries at once. In this paper a new heuristic function (hc), dynamic query ordering heuristics, and Depth-First Branch-and-Bound (DFBB) are defined and experimentally evaluated, and compared with existing methods which use A* and static query ordering.

{"title": "E cient Storage for Synchronized Digital Audio and Video\n", "abstract": " An increasing set of applications require access to stored digital audio and video data. Applications like Video {on {Demand and multi {media browsing typically access stored compositions of such data and require that they be reproduced at the time of retrieval. An important feature of such accesses is their continuous and real {time nature in addition to their synchronous reproduction of compositions. It has been previously documented (Jai92]) that such requirements of multi {media applications require new solutions to managing digital audio and video data in storage devices.The key to providing such accesses is expected to emerge from a synergy of solutions to two problems. One is of designing strategies to schedule accesses to the storage system especially to when dynamic changes in playback of digitized video and audio by applications are allowed. The other problem is that of managing the storage of such data in the storage system. The solution to the later problem includes approaches to deriving placement in storage systems by anticipating composition (synchronization) and play {out rate during application playback. Besides providing synchronized retrieval, many applications require that the components of such composition (eg, pure audio or video) be stored in distinct homogeneous, ie only audio or video data (but not both), blocks in the storage system. Maintaining this separation in the storage system allows subsequent re {compositions without having to re {organize una ected components and allows independent retrievals of components.

{"title": "A QoS Based Scheduling Algorithm for Continuous Media Servers\n", "abstract": " A growing set of applications require digital audio and video data, commonly referred to as continuous media (CM). These applications require continuous real {time data ow during playback and recording. Scheduling strategies to service accesses by multiple concurrent applications at CM data servers (CMS) must provide timely access to storage devices. Besides real {time access, such data is characterized by its large size and high transmission bandwidth and must be compressed to elimiate temporal and spatial redundancy. However, by compressing data, data rate variability is introduced which creates problems to the scheduling strategy like low resource and bandwidth utilization. In this paper we present a scheduling strategy at the CMS for compressed streams called QBSCAN which exploits clients' concessions in playback quality to achieve higher utilization of the CMS. By stating the needed Quality of Service (QoS), clients declare their level of acceptance of tardiness and smoothness during playback. QBSCAN uses clients' QoS speci cations to allocate I/O bandwidth and consequently increases the resource utilization. Simultaneously, the total capacity (the number of concurrent streams supported) of the CMS is enhanced.

Our analysis shows that the method achieves maximum parallelism for a very high percentage of array operations. We have derived the exact conditions under which optimality is achieved. Also provided are the worst and average case bounds on array operation performance.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "Specification and Use of of Approximate Synchronization in Multimedia Presentations\n", "abstract": " Emergence of multimedia computing have brought forth new horizons and challenges to traditional computing. New notions of synchronization requirements is one such novelty of multimedia computations, which forms the subject matter of this publication. Up until the emergence of multimedia, all synchronizations were strict in the sense that simultaneaty, parallelism or sequencing of two streams of activity was describable by specifying time points in their execution histories. In the domain of multimedia, due to the grossness of human perception such stringent requirements can be relaxed. We investigate consequences of this new notion of synchrony and develop a hierarchical speci cation model for multimedia compositions. Relaxing synchronization points to time intervals make other known synchronization models a special cases ours. Algorithms to compile such multimedia speci cations in to service requirements have been developed. The end result of this translation is an assignment of a range of time stamps to every sample in parallel media streams. Our time stamping algorithm extends existing algorithms in this area.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1167"]}

{"title": "A TRANSACTION MODEL FOR PARALLEL PRODUCTION SYSTEMS PART II: MODEL AND EVALUATION\n", "abstract": " Parallel-rule firing approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of production systems. However, few models have been developed to measure the performance of parallel-rule firing approaches. There are three approaches to evaluating system performance, namely, analytical modeling, simulation, and system prototyping or implementation. Analytical modeling has its advantage in being cost effective and providing a powerful tool for studying various aspects of system performance by varying system parameters. Since analytical modeling has been very successfully used in evaluating database system performance, we develop such a model for parallel production systems, where rule firing is modeled as a transaction. Both resource contention and data contention are modeled in detail and the performance of locking, timestamp and optimistic approaches is analyzed. We show that significant\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
{"title": "A TRANSACTION MODEL FOR PARALLEL RULE EXECUTION PART I: MODEL AND ALGORITHMS\n", "abstract": " This paper introduces a transaction model for parallel production systems, where rules can be fired in a completely asynchronous parallel manner. A model is developed to describe two properties of a serial production system execution, namely, conditional dependence (a rule firing removes another from the conflict set) and prioritization (by the conflict resolution mechanism). These are used as the basis to define the correctness criteria for parallel production execution, namely, conditional serializability, prioritized serializability, and prioritized conditional serializability. A graph model is used to represent production system execution which provides a means of expressing correctness as graph acyclicity, which in turn is used as a basis to develop practical schedulers that manage the concurrent asynchronous production execution and ensure correctness. Two practical schedulers, namely, conditional strict two-phase\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1167"]}
