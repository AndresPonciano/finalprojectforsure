Methods: Stabilized HOCl is in the form of a physiologically balanced solution in 0.9% saline at a pH range of 3.5 to 4.0. Chlorine species distribution in solution is a function of pH. In aqueous solution, HOCl is the predominant species at the pH range of 3 to 6. At pH values less than 3.5, the solution exists as a mixture of chlorine in aqueous phase, chlorine gas, trichloride (Cl 3\u0393\u00ea\u00c6), and HOCl.

Unlike adult tumors, recurrent somatic mutations in NB, such as tumor protein 53 (p53) mutations, occur with relative paucity. In addition, p53 downstream function is intact in NB cells with wild-type p53, suggesting that reactivation of p53 may be a viable therapeutic strategy for NB treatment.

{"title": "A small-molecule inhibitor of UBE2N induces neuroblastoma cell death via activation of p53 and JNK pathways\n", "abstract": " Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial neoplasm in children. In NB, loss of p53 function is largely due to cytoplasmic sequestration rather than mutation. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N), also known as Ubc13, is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that promotes formation of monomeric p53 that results in its cytoplasmic translocation and subsequent loss of function. Therefore, inhibition of UBE2N may reactivate p53 by promoting its nuclear accumulation. Here, we show that NSC697923, a novel UBE2N inhibitor, exhibits potent cytotoxicity in a panel of NB cell lines evidenced by its ability to induce apoptosis. In p53 wild-type NB cells, NSC697923 induced nuclear accumulation of p53, which led to its increased transcriptional activity and tumor suppressor function. Interestingly, in p53 mutant NB cells, NSC697923 induced cell death by activating JNK pathway.

{"title": "Four rice genes encoding NADP malic enzyme exhibit distinct expression profiles\n", "abstract": " In plants, the NADP malic enzymes (NADP-MEs) are encoded by small gene families. These NADP-ME gene families are relatively well described in C4 plants but not well studied in C3 plants. In this study, we investigated the NADP-ME gene family in a model C3 monocot plant (rice, Oryza sativa) based on its recently released genomic DNA sequence. We found that the rice NADP-ME family is composed of four members, one plastidic NADP-ME and three cytosolic versions. Although the rice NADP-ME genes identified share a high degree of similarity with one another, one cytosolic NADP-ME (OscytME3) contains several unique amino acid substitutions within highly conserved amino acid regions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OscytME3 might be derived from a different evolutionary branch than the other three rice genes. Expression analysis of the four rice NADP-ME genes indicated that each had a different tissue-specific and developmental profile, although all four responded to stress stimuli.", "num_citations": "80\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Mechanical behavior of carbon fiber composite lattice core sandwich panels fabricated by laser cutting\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a novel method for rapid fabrication and prototyping of low-density carbon fiber sandwich panel cores based on laser beam cutting (LBC). Using LCB, sandwich panels with lattice core constructions with oblique and vertical strut morphologies were fabricated from two fiber-orientation architectures. Scanning electron microscopy images illustrate the relatively small extent of damage from laser cutting. The shear strength of the lattice cores was improved by eliminating core-to-face sheet bond failures. Crushing and shear responses of fabricated truss cores were measured, and analytical models are presented to predict the stiffness, strength and dominant failure modes under each loading condition. The sandwich-panel cores investigated appear to be promising candidates for lightweight systems and multifunctional applications.", "num_citations": "69\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Consequently, several new ideas have been proposed; among them a key technique is focused crawling which is able to crawl particular topical portions of the World Wide Web quickly without having to explore all Web pages. In this paper, we present an intelligent focused crawler algorithm in which we embed ontology to evaluate the page's relevance to the topic. Compared with other algorithms using domain knowledge, our algorithm can evolve the ontology automatically during crawl process. Considering the instinct characteristics of the ontology, propagation has also been imported to accelerate the evolution of the ontology.

{"title": "Phonon mean free path of graphite along the c-axis\n", "abstract": " Phonon transport in the c-axis direction of graphite thin films has been studied using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The simulation results show that the c-axis thermal conductivities for films of thickness ranging from 20 to 500 atomic layers are significantly lower than the bulk value. Based on the MD data, a method is developed to construct the c-axis thermal conductivity as an accumulation function of phonon mean free path (MFP), from which we show that phonons with MFPs from 2 to 2000\u0393\u00c7\u00ebnm contribute \u0393\u00ea\u255d80% of the graphite c-axis thermal conductivity at room temperature, and phonons with MFPs larger than 100\u0393\u00c7\u00ebnm contribute over 40% to the c-axis thermal conductivity.

{"title": "Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) mediates the prostate cancer-induced formation of new bone\n", "abstract": " The tendency of prostate cancer to produce osteoblastic bone metastases suggests that cancer cells and osteoblasts interact in ways that contribute to cancer progression. To identify factors that mediate these interactions, we compared gene expression patterns between two bone-derived prostate cancer cell lines that produce osteoblastic (MDA PCa 2b) or osteolytic lesions (PC-3). Both cell lines expressed Wnt ligands, including WNT7b, a canonical Wnt implicated in osteogenesis. PC-3 cells expressed 50 times more Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of Wnt pathways, than did MDA PCa 2b cells. Evaluation of the functional role of these factors (in cocultures of prostate cancer cells with primary mouse osteoblasts (PMOs) or in bone organ cultures) showed that MDA PCa 2b cells activated Wnt canonical signaling in PMOs and that DKK1 blocked osteoblast proliferation and new bone formation induced by MDA PCa\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "66\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Biological control is a promising method to protect plants as chemical pesticides may cause environment pollution. Pseudomonas fluorescens 2P24 had strong inhibitory on Rastonia solanacearum, Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani, etc., and was isolated from the wheat rhizosphere take-all decline soils in Shandong province, China. However, its potential effect on soil fungal community was still unknown. In this study, the gfp-labeled P. fluorescens 2P24 was inoculated into cucumber rhizosphere, and the survival of 2P24 was monitored weekly. The amount decreased from 108 to 105 CFU/g dry soils. The effect of 2P24 on soil fungal community in cucumber rhizosphere was investigated using T-RFLP and DGGE. In T-RFLP analysis, principle component analysis showed that the soil fungal community was greatly influenced at first, digested with restriction enzyme Hinf I and Taq I. However, there was little difference as digested by different enzymes. DGGE results demonstrated that the soil fungal community was greatly shocked at the beginning, but it recovered slowly with the decline of P. fluorescens 2P24. Four weeks later, there was little difference between the treatment and control. Generally speaking, the effect of P. fluorescens 2P24 on soil fungal community in cucumber rhizosphere was just transient.", "num_citations": "65\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Efficiency degradation behaviors of current/thermal co-stressed GaN-based blue light emitting diodes with vertical-structure\n", "abstract": " With this work, we demonstrate a three-stage degradation behavior of GaN based LED chips under current/thermal co-stressing. The three stages in sequence are the initial improvement stage, the platform stage, and the rapid degradation stage, indicating that current/thermal co-stressing activates positive effects and negative ones simultaneously, and the dominant degradation mechanisms evolve with aging time. Degradation mechanisms are discussed. Electric current stress has dual characters: damaging the active layers by generating defects and at the same time improving the p-type conductivity by activating the Mg-dopant. High temperature stresses will promote the effects from electric current stresses. The activation of the Mg-dopant will saturate, whereas the generation of defects is carried on in a progressive way.

Palladium-copper nanoparticles were prepared in BCF by immersing BCF in a mixture solution of PdCl2 and CuCl2 in water and followed reduction of absorbed metallic ion inside of BCF to the metallic Pd-Cu nanoparticles using potassium borohydride. The bare BCF and the composites were characterized by a range of analytical techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results reveal that the Pd-Cu nanoparticles were homogeneously precipitated on the BCF surface.

Four spatial interpolation methods including Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Spline, Kriging, and Cokriging were tested to interpolate LST in southern New England using ground temperatures measured at national weather stations (NWS) in summer 2001. The performance of each interpolation method was evaluated using field measurements collected in a mixed forest in Connecticut during the study period. Kriging is recommended for LST interpolation when surface emissivity data are not available. By analyzing the field data, we found that the maximum daily interpolation error occurred in the early morning and the minimum error occurred at around hour 18: 00. Validation result shows that the accuracy of spatial interpolation of LST was much improved after being calibrated by satellite-derived surface emissivity. The average interpolation error reduced from 10 oC before calibration to 1.56 oC after calibration.", "num_citations": "59\n", "authors": ["19"]}

H2S precursor inhibited catecholamine stimulated lipolysis. Thus, we hypothesized that CSE/H2S system regulates lipolysis which contributed to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.  Methods We treated rat adipocyte with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, a CSE inhibitor), L-cysteine (an H2S precursor) plus pyridoxial phosphate (co-enzyme) or the H2S chronic release donor GYY4137, then the glycerol level was assayed for assessing the lipolysis. Then, the effects of PAG and GYY4137 on insulin resistance in high fatty diet (HFD) induced obese mice were investigated.  Results Here, we found that PAG time-dependently increased basal or isoproterenol stimulated lipolysis. However, L-cysteine plus pyridoxial phosphate or GYY4137 significantly reduced it. PAG increased phosphorylated protein kinase A substrate, perilipin 1 and hormone sensitive lipase, but L-cysteine and GYY4137 decreased the parameters. In HFD induced obese mice, PAG increased adipose basal lipolysis, thus blunted fat mass increase, resulting in lowering insulin resistance evidenced by reduction of fasting glucose, insulin level, HOMA index, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) curve area and elevating the insulin tolerance test (ITT) response. GYY4137 inhibited lipolysis in vivo without increasing fat mass, but also ameliorated the insulin resistance in HFD mice.

{"title": "Alteration of the intestinal barrier and GLP2 secretion in Berberine-treated type 2 diabetic rats\n", "abstract": " For centuries, Berberine has been used in the treatment of enteritis in China, and it is also known to have anti-hyperglycemic effects in type 2 diabetic patients. However, as Berberine is insoluble and rarely absorbed in gastrointestinal tract, the mechanism by which it works is unclear. We hypothesized that it may act locally by ameliorating intestinal barrier abnormalities and endotoxemia. A high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin was used to induce type 2 diabetes in male Sprague Dawley rats. Berberine (100 mg/kg) was administered by lavage to diabetic rats for 2 weeks and saline was given to controls. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance improved in the Berberine group, although there was no significant decrease in blood glucose. Berberine treatment also led to a notable restoration of intestinal villi/mucosa structure and less infiltration of inflammatory cells, along with a decrease in plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level. Tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) was also decreased in diabetic rats but was restored by Berberine treatment. Glutamine-induced glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP2) secretion from ileal tissue decreased dramatically in the diabetic group but was restored by Berberine treatment. Fasting insulin, insulin resistance index, plasma LPS level, and ZO1 expression were significantly correlated with GLP2 level. In type 2 diabetic rats, Berberine treatment not only augments GLP2 secretion and improves diabetes but is also effective in repairing the damaged intestinal mucosa, restoring intestinal permeability, and improving endotoxemia. Whether these effects are mechanistically related will require further\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "52\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The mechanism of LFA-1 activation involves both affinity and avidity regulation, but the role of each in T cell activation remains unclear. We have identified antibodies that recognize and block different affinity states of the mouse LFA-1 I-domain. Monoclonal antibody 2D7 preferentially binds to the low affinity conformation, and this specific binding is abolished when LFA-1 is locked in the high affinity conformation. In contrast, M17/4 can bind both the locked high and low affinity forms of LFA-1. Although both 2D7 and M17/4 are blocking antibodies, 2D7 is significantly less potent than M17/4 in blocking LFA-1-mediated adhesion; thus, blocking high affinity LFA-1 is critical for preventing LFA-1-mediated adhesion.

The proposed model accommodates assumptions of s-dependence among degradation processes and allows for different marginal distributions. This flexibility makes the model more attractive compared with the multivariate distribution model, which lay on the limitation of the homogeneous marginal distribution and can only describe linear correlation. Marginal degradation process is modeled by the inverse Gaussian (IG) process with time scale transformation. Furthermore, we incorporate random drift to account for the possible heterogeneity in population. This paper also develops the statistical inference method using EM algorithm with two-stage procedure. The comparison results of the reliability estimation under both s-dependent and s-independent assumptions are illustrated in the illustrative example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.", "num_citations": "46\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Given that ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced renal injury is featured by the excessive immune response; the current study is therefore designed to address the impact of dexamethasone on IR-induced renal injury, a common disorder in the clinical settings. Precondition of mice with 4 mg/kg of dexamethasone significantly attenuated IR-induced injury as manifested by the improved renal function along with ameliorated pathological changes and suppressed inflammatory infiltration. Mechanistic studies revealed that dexamethasone promotes GR activation, and by which it attenuates the signals for PI3K/AKT activation. Attenuated PI3K/AKT signaling thus suppresses inflammatory response which then protects kidneys from IR-induced injury. All\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "43\n", "authors": ["19"]}

TWR image formation is reformulated as a compressed sensing (CS) problem, seeking a sparse representation in the spatial domain. In traditional CS-based through-the-wall radar imaging (TWRI) methods, the measurement matrix is vectorized so that a single measurement vector (SMV) model is applied to generate a sparse solution, which represents a scene comprising point-like targets. For multiple measurement TWRI problems, the SMV model may produce a sub-optimum sparse solution. On the other hand, the proposed MMV model for TWRI generates a more sparse scene by processing all the measurements simultaneously. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to fuse multiple polarization data to form the radar image\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "42\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Thermal conductivity is simulated over the temperature range of 20\u0393\u00c7\u00f480 K.

Since neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes (M) often respond reciprocally to pathologic stimuli, experiments were designed to investigate whether increments in PMN and M per se could influence NK cell function. Peripheral blood NK cells obtained by Percoll gradient centrifugation were either cocultured with various concentrations of autologous PMN or M or they were exposed to diffusates of these granulocytes in Millipore chambers.

In all cases the maximal increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis was 8-9-fold. In contrast to normal intracellular signaling, however, the mutant receptor with all three threonines changed to alanines (Ala550,553,554) failed to undergo normal down-regulation in response to carbachol.

{"title": "Molecular dynamics study of DNA translocation through graphene nanopores\n", "abstract": " A molecular dynamics simulation method is used to study the translocation of a single strand DNA through nanopores opened on graphene membranes. Simulation results uncover that the translocation time for four DNA strands (20G, 20A, 20T, and 20C) is proportional to the size of the four DNA bases. However, the change of the ionic current is caused not only by the physical blockade of the DNA, but also induced by the change of the ion distribution once the negatively charged DNA enters the nanopore. An electric double layer will be formed and causes higher cation and lower anion concentration near the DNA strand surface, which makes the ionic current blockade not sensitive to the base size for a single-layer graphene nanopore. Increasing the graphene membrane thickness can enhance the DNA physical blockage effect on ionic current and improve the nanopore sensitivity to the four DNA bases.", "num_citations": "37\n", "authors": ["19"]}

In many cancers, it has been shown that the high levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and/or MMP-9 are associated with the invasive phenotypes of cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of cantharidin, a derivative of blister beetles which is one of the traditional Chinese medicines, on the adhesion, migration, and invasion of human bladder cancer TSGH-8301 cells. Cantharidin effectively suppressed TSGH-8301 cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner. Results from Western blotting, RT-PCR, and gelatin zymography assays indicated that cantharidin blocked the protein levels, gene expression (mRNA), and activities of MMP-2 and -9 in TSGH-8301 cells. Cantharidin also significantly suppressed the protein expressions of p-p38 and p-JNK1/2 in TSGH-8301 cells.

At 1 day APISE, mGluR8 immunoreactivity was up-regulated in the entire molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. At 7 days APISE, mGluR8 immunoreactive cells began to appear in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA1, and by day 31, they were seen in all layers of CA1. By electron microscopy and double labelling study, the mGluR8 immunoreactive cells were identified as astrocytes. The present novel finding of induced expression of mGluR8 in astrocytes APISE suggests that it may be linked to gliosis.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The calculation of the temperature dependence of FR at 633 and 1150 nm wavelengths is presented as well. The Faraday effect contributed by the Ce 3+ ions is caused mainly by the intraionic electrical dipole transitions between the 4f and 5d configurations. The effect of the crystal field (CF), superexchange interaction, and spin-orbit coupling on the magneto-optical (MO) effect has been discussed. The energy differences between the lowest and second CF-split 5d levels and the lowest CF-split 4f level are 1.36 and 3.10 eV, respectively. Therefore there are anomalous rotatory dispersions at about 1.36 and 3.10 eV.

P.gingivalis fimbriae act as an important virulence factor in AS. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) may play a crucial role in autoimmune response during this process. However, whether P.gingivalis infection is associated with Tregs dysregulation during AS is still unknown and the prevalence of different P.gingivalis FimA genotypes during this process is unclear. Here we analyzed the distribution of Tregs and in P.gingivalis-infected atherosclerotic patients to reveal the relationship between P.gingivalis infection and Tregs reduction/dysfunction and to elucidate their role in periodontitis-AS interaction. FimA genotype was also examined to determine the prevalence of fimbriae. Our results showed that P.gingivalis infection reduced Tregs in atherosclerotic patients compared with non-atherosclerotic patients and health controls. Concentration of TGF-\u256c\u25931, which plays an important role in the development of Tregs, also decreased in P.gingivalis infected patients. Furthermore, type II FimA seems to show higher prevalence than the other five detected types. The population of Tregs further decreased in patients with type II FimA compared with the other types. P.gingivlias FimA genotype II was the dominant type associated with decreased Treg population. These results indicate that P.gingivalis infection may be associated with Tregs dysregulation in AS; type II FimA may be a predominant genotype in this process.", "num_citations": "32\n", "authors": ["19"]}

This is identified on-line using the forgetting factor recursive least square (FFRLS) technique. In order to handle input amplitude constraints, the Lagrange Multiplier method is implemented in GPC while the optimal control sequence is obtained by minimizing a multistage objective function.

{"title": "Orexin-A Promotes Cell Migration in Cultured Rat Astrocytes via Ca2+-Dependent PKC\u256c\u2592 and ERK1/2 Signals\n", "abstract": " Orexin-A is an important neuropeptide involved in the regulation of feeding, arousal, energy consuming, and reward seeking in the body. The effects of orexin-A have widely studied in neurons but not in astrocytes. Here, we report that OX1R and OX2R are expressed in cultured rat astrocytes. Orexin-A stimulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and then induced the migration of astrocytes via its receptor OX1R but not OX2R. Orexin-A-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and astrocytes migration are Ca2+-dependent, since they could be inhibited by either chelating the extracellular Ca2+ or blocking the pathway of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Furthermore, both non-selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor and PKC\u256c\u2592 selective inhibitor, but not PKC\u256c\u2524 inhibitor, prevented the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the migration of astrocytes, indicating that the Ca2+-dependent PKC\u256c\u2592 acts as the downstream of the OX1R activation and mediates the orexin-A-induced increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell migration. In conclusion, these results suggest that orexin-A can stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation and then facilitate the migration of astrocytes via PLC-PKC\u256c\u2592 signal pathway, providing new knowledge about the functions of the OX1R in astrocytes.", "num_citations": "30\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Recent studies have shown that antioxidants can extend the lifespan of rotifers. In this paper, we analyzed changes in the mRNA expression level of genes encoding the antioxidants manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper and zinc SOD (CuZnSOD) and catalase (CAT) during rotifer aging to clarify the function of these enzymes in this process. We also investigated the effects of common life-prolonging methods [dietary restriction (DR) and resveratrol] on the mRNA expression level of these genes. The results showed that the mRNA expression level of MnSOD decreased with aging, whereas that of CuZnSOD increased. The mRNA expression of CAT did not change significantly. This suggests that the ability to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria reduces with aging, thus aggravating the damaging effect of ROS on the mitochondria. DR significantly increased the mRNA expression level of MnSOD, CuZnSOD and CAT, which might explain why DR is able to extend rotifer lifespan. Although resveratrol also increased the mRNA expression level of MnSOD, it had significant inhibitory effects on the mRNA expression of CuZnSOD and CAT. In short, mRNA expression levels of CAT, MnSOD and CuZnSOD are likely to reflect the ability of mitochondria to eliminate ROS and delay the aging process.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["19"]}

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 178 patients with stable warfarin dose requirements and an international normalized ratio (INR) of the prothrombin time within the target range (1.5-3.0). Polymorphisms for VKORC1 (1173C> T), CYP2C9, venous INR, and plasma concentration and unbound concentration of warfarin were analyzed. RESULTS: VKORC1 (1173C> T) genotyping showed that 154 patients were homozygous TT, 23 were heterozygous CT, and one was homozygous for the CC genotype. Patients with the VKORC1 (1173CC+ CT) genotype required a significantly higher warfarin dose (3.33\u252c\u25921.04 mg/day) than those with 1173TT (1.81\u252c\u25920.63 mg/day; p< 0.001).

With polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a hydrophilic polymer matrix and ketoprofen (KET) as a model drug, polymer-drug composites in the form of nanoparticles were prepared and characterized. The surface morphologies, the physical status of the drug, and the drug-polymer interactions were studied using FESEM, DSC, XRD, and ATR-FTIR. FESEM observations demonstrated that the nanoparticles gradually decreased in size from 640 \u252c\u2592 350, to 530 \u252c\u2592 320, 460 \u252c\u2592 200 and 320 \u252c\u2592 160 nm as the KET content increased from 0, to 9.1%, 16.7% and 33.3% w/w, respectively. Results from DSC and XRD suggested that KET was distributed in the PVP matrix in an amorphous manner at the molecular level. This is thought to be due to their compatibility, arising through hydrogen bonding as demonstrated by ATR- FTIR spectra. In vitro dissolution tests showed that the nanoparticles released the incorporated KET within 1 min, evidencing markedly improved dissolution over pure KET and a KET-PVP physical mixture. Electrospraying can hence offer a facile route to develop new polymer composites for biomedical applications, in particular for improving dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble drugs.", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The main difference between our work and the existing techniques is that the proposed method can locate the sparse topology while training. In contrast, most of the traditional methods need to train the model before finding the sparse support vectors.

{"title": "Southeast University\n", "abstract": " In multi-label learning, each training example is associated with a set of labels and the task is to predict the proper label set for the unseen example. Due to the tremendous (exponential) number of possible label sets, the task of learning from multi-label examples is rather challenging. Therefore, the key to successful multi-label learning is how to effectively exploit correlations between different labels to facilitate the learning process. In this paper, we propose to use a Bayesian network structure to efficiently encode the conditional dependencies of the labels as well as the feature set, with the feature set as the common parent of all labels. To make it practical, we give an approximate yet efficient procedure to find such a network structure.

Their cells are divided by a lipidic intracytoplasmic membrane and they share a number of eukaryote-like molecular characteristics. However, their genomic structures, potential abilities, and evolutionary status are still unknown. In this study, we searched for common protein families and a core genome/pan genome based on 11 sequenced species in family Planctomycetaceae. Then, we constructed phylogenetic tree based on their 832 common protein families. We also annotated the 11 genomes using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups database. Moreover, we predicted and reconstructed their core/pan metabolic pathways using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) orthology system. Subsequently, we identified genomic islands (GIs) and structural variations (SVs) among the five complete genomes and we specifically investigated the integration of two Planctomycetaceae plasmids in all 11 genomes. The results indicate that Planctomycetaceae species share diverse genomic variations and unique genomic characteristics, as well as have huge potential for human applications.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "The contribution of sound intensity in vocal emotion perception: behavioral and electrophysiological evidence\n", "abstract": " Although its role is frequently stressed in acoustic profile for vocal emotion, sound intensity is frequently regarded as a control parameter in neurocognitive studies of vocal emotion, leaving its role and neural underpinnings unclear. To investigate these issues, we asked participants to rate the angry level of neutral and angry prosodies before and after sound intensity modification in Experiment 1, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) for mismatching emotional prosodies with and without sound intensity modification and for matching emotional prosodies while participants performed emotional feature or sound intensity congruity judgment in Experiment 2. It was found that sound intensity modification had significant effect on the rating of angry level for angry prosodies, but not for neutral ones. Moreover, mismatching emotional prosodies, relative to matching ones, induced enhanced N2/P3 complex and theta band synchronization irrespective of sound intensity modification and task demands. However, mismatching emotional prosodies with reduced sound intensity showed prolonged peak latency and decreased amplitude in N2/P3 complex and smaller theta band synchronization. These findings suggest that though it cannot categorically affect emotionality conveyed in emotional prosodies, sound intensity contributes to emotional significance quantitatively, implying that sound intensity should not simply be taken as a control parameter and its unique role needs to be specified in vocal emotion studies.", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "AluScan: a method for genome-wide scanning of sequence and structure variations in the human genome\n", "abstract": " To complement next-generation sequencing technologies, there is a pressing need for efficient pre-sequencing capture methods with reduced costs and DNA requirement. The Alu family of short interspersed nucleotide elements is the most abundant type of transposable elements in the human genome and a recognized source of genome instability. With over one million Alu elements distributed throughout the genome, they are well positioned to facilitate genome-wide sequence amplification and capture of regions likely to harbor genetic variation hotspots of biological relevance. Here we report on the use of inter-Alu PCR with an enhanced range of amplicons in conjunction with next-generation sequencing to generate an Alu-anchored scan, or 'AluScan', of DNA sequences between Alu transposons, where Alu consensus sequence-based 'H-type' PCR primers that elongate outward from the head of an Alu element are combined with 'T-type' primers elongating from the poly-A containing tail to achieve huge amplicon range. To illustrate the method, glioma DNA was compared with white blood cell control DNA of the same patient by means of AluScan. The over 10 Mb sequences obtained, derived from more than 8,000 genes spread over all the chromosomes, revealed a highly reproducible capture of genomic sequences enriched in genic sequences and cancer candidate gene regions. Requiring only sub-micrograms of sample DNA, the power of AluScan as a discovery tool for genetic variations was demonstrated by the identification of 357 instances of loss of heterozygosity, 341 somatic indels, 274 somatic SNVs, and seven potential somatic\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "25\n", "authors": ["19"]}

However, it is unclear whether phytoalexin production and ROS burst are involved in the disease resistance conferred by the expression of the harpinXoo protein in rice. In this article, ectopic expression of hrf1 in rice enhanced resistance to bacterial blight. Accompanying with the activation of genes related to the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway in hrf1-transformed rice, phytoalexins quickly and consistently accumulated concurrent with the limitation of bacterial growth rate. Moreover, the hrf1-transformed rice showed an increased ability for ROS scavenging and decreased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration. Furthermore, the localization and relative quantification of silicon deposition in rice leaves was detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). Finally, the transcript levels of defense response genes increased in transformed rice. These results show a correlation between Xoo resistance and phytoalexin production, H2O2, silicon deposition and defense gene expression in hrf1-transformed rice. These data are significant because they provide evidence for a better understanding the role of defense responses in the incompatible interaction between bacterial disease and hrf1-transformed plants.

Here we show that the same receptors mediate short-term plasticity manifested by frequency-dependent facilitation of evoked glutamate release at these synapses.

Evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents showed strong facilitation at relatively low frequencies (3\u0393\u00c7\u00ebHz) of activation.

{"title": "Characterization of a novel human testis-specific gene: testis developmental related gene 1 (TDRG1)\n", "abstract": " Spermatogenesis is a highly coordinated physiological process that requires the correct expression and functions of thousands of developmentally regulated genes. The regulation of spermatogenesis is not well defined, since majority of the related genes have neither been identified nor fully characterized. Hence, it is meaningful to identify and characterize these genes to reveal the mechanism underlying spermatogenesis. In this study, using digital differential display, we identified a novel human testis-specific gene, testis developmental related gene 1 (TDRG1, GenBank DQ168992), via electronic subtraction of human testis UniGene databases from those of non-reproductive tissues. The transcript of the TDRG1 gene has an open-reading frame that encodes 100 amino acids. We next prepared the anti-TDRG1 monoclonal antibody 10B6 and confirmed that it specifically recognizes an 11-kDa protein in the tissue extracts from an adult human testicular sample (age 31 years) by Western blot analysis. RT-PCR coupled with immunohistochemistry of human tissues demonstrated that TDRG1 is exclusively expressed in the testis but not in any other non-reproductive tissues. TDRG1 is mainly located in spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules of adult testis. Furthermore, TDRG1 shows the highest expression level in human post-puberty testis, with the expression levels decreasing afterwards with aging. Importantly, TDRG1 mRNA is undetectable in the fetal testis, as judged by RT-PCR. In conclusion, TDRG1 is a developmentally regulated testicular-specific gene.

In addition, a novel power supply topology based on two coupled coils, pulse generator circuit, and a fast switch, is proposed since several 100 V in voltage, 10-100 A in current, several hundred millisecond in pulse width is needed for flash LiDAR system onboard a small low-cost civilian UAV platform, and the traditional power supply had problems in efficiency and bulk. Finally, laser emitting and the power supply are assembled and tested. The size of laser footprint is 4398.031 mm x 4398.031 mm in x and y axes, respectively, when shitting from a flight height of 300 m, which is close to the theoretic size of 4.5 mx 4.5 m. The difference of 102 mm can meet the requirement of flash LiDAR data collection at a flight height of 300 m. Future work on extensive and on-going investigation and investments for a prototype of flash LiDAR system is drawn up as well.", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The energy dissipation or the friction force between the inner and outer tubes is strongly related to thermal effects and shows a minimum as temperature increases. At ultra-low temperatures, thermal lubrication, ie the reduction in the friction force because of thermal activation, plays a dominant role because energy barriers for the relative translational movement of the concentric nanotubes are so small that the thermally activated jumps effectively reduce the friction force. However, as temperature increases, the thermal jump probability saturates and when the temperature reaches a critical value the dominant phonon frequency exceeds the vibration frequency of the oscillator and more phonons will be excited by the mechanical vibration, which leads to a monotonic increase of the\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Materials and methods The proposed workflow consisted of brain extraction, rigid registration, distortion correction, artifacts rejection, spatial smoothing and tensor estimation. Rigid registration was utilized to correct misalignments. Motion artifacts were rejected by using local Pearson correlation coefficient (LPCC). The performance of LPCC in characterizing relative differences between artifacts and artifact-free images was compared with that of the conventional correlation coefficient in 10 randomly selected DKI datasets. The influence of rejected artifacts with information of gradient directions and b values for the parameter estimation was investigated by using mean square error (MSE). The variance of noise was used as the criterion for MSEs. The clinical practicality of the proposed workflow was evaluated by the image quality and measurements in regions of interest on 36 DKI datasets, including 18 artifact-free (18 pediatric subjects) and 18 motion-corrupted datasets (15 pediatric subjects and 3 essential tremor patients).  Results The relative difference between artifacts and artifact-free images calculated by LPCC was larger than that of the conventional correlation coefficient (p<0.05). It indicated that LPCC was more sensitive in detecting motion artifacts. MSEs of all derived parameters from the reserved data after the artifacts rejection were smaller than the variance of the noise. It suggested that influence of rejected artifacts was less than influence of noise on the precision of derived parameters.

Studies of the interfacial composition revealed that cosurfactants at the interface (nai) increased with the increase of R and decreased with the increase of additional water. This indicated that more cosurfactants were required to form a IL/O microemulsion than that of the traditional water/oil (W/O) microemulsion.

The Basiodiomycete, Agaricus brasiliensis Murill (ABM) is a dietary mushroom and has been known for its immuneenhancing, antitumor, antioxidation, antiviral and antimutagenesis functions. However, the exact anticancer mechanisms of ABM on human oral cancer cells are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 50% ethanol crude extracts and hot water extracts of ABM on oral cancer CAL 27 cells. We observed that 0.9 mg/ml and 0.7 mg/ml of ABM 50% ethanol crude extracts and hot water, respectively, caused morphological changes and significantly reduced cell viability after 48-h treatment. The results showed that both extracts of ABM inhibited cell proliferation, increased the Ca2+ release, reduced the mitochondria membrane potential (\u256c\u00f6\u256c\u00bfm), and caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The effects of electric field strength indicated by electric current on the electroremediation behavior, including the pH of purging solution, the conductivity, phenanthrene concentration and flow rate of effluent, were experimentally investigated, respectively. In case of an electric field of 25mA applied for 72 hours, over 90% of phenanthrene was removed from 424 g (dry weight) of kaolinite at an energy consumption of 0.148 KWh.

{"title": "Isolated speech recognition using artificial neural networks\n", "abstract": " In this project artificial neural networks are used as research tool to accomplish automated speech recognition of normal speech. A small size vocabulary containing the words YES and NO is chosen. Spectral features using cepstral analysis are extracted per frame and imported to a feed-forward neural network which uses a backpropagation with momentum training algorithm. The network is trained to recognize and classify the incoming words into the respective categories. The output from the neural network is loaded into a pattern search function, which matches the input sequence with a set of target word patterns. The level of variability in input speech patterns limits the vocabulary and affects the reliability of the network. The results from the first stage of this. work are satisfactory and thus the application of artificial neural networks in conjunction with cepstral analysis in isolated word recognition holds promise.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["19"]}

In this paper, we define a framework to find evolution patterns which are regular in dynamic networks.

In our framework, different snapshots of the dynamic network are transformed to a summary graph, and then occurrence rules are discovered for searching for evolution patterns. We also take noise into account by finding quasi-patterns instead of only precise ones. We analyze the time- and space-complexity of the approach. Experiments on synthetic dynamic networks and real-world dynamic networks show that our approach is efficient, so it can be used to find patterns in large scale networks with many snapshots.

For sparse filter design, the zero-attracting LMS (ZA-LMS) incorporates the l 1  norm penalty function into the quadratic LMS cost function to promote the sparseness during the adaptation process. The reweighted ZA-LMS (RZA-LMS) is developed using reweighted zero attractors with better performance. In this paper, we propose two new sparse LMS algorithms with segment zero attractors, referred as Segment RZA-LMS and Discrete Segment RZA-LMS. The Segment RZA-LMS outperforms RZA-LMS by using a piece-wise approximation of the reciprocal in the iterative algorithm of RZA-LMS.

This line passes through many districts that mostly covered with loess and includes many double-line loess tunnels. These loess tunnels have a cross-section area of more than 160 m2 and a span of more than 15 m. That should be defined to be super large cross-section tunnel. Due to the special property of loess and the increase of tunnel's span and area, how the wall rock pressure responds to the change in buried depth is unknown. At present, there has no unified opinion on the critical buried depth for large-span loess tunnel. To solve the problem, investigation was firstly done on 12 tunnels to find the relationship between ground surface cracks and buried depth. After analysis of the relationship, critical depth variety was given as follows: less than 11m defined to be super shallow burial; more than 60 m defined to be deep burial; and between 40 m and 60 m defined to be critical depth for shallow burial and deep burial. Shear slippage limit theory is used for check out the analytical conclusion; and a good agreement has been obtained.

{"title": "Producing mechanism of flow noise generation from perforated duct muffler element\n", "abstract": " Based on erasing effect from flow noise in the head lattice of microphones and background noise in the flow source, a method to measure the flow noise regeneration from mufflers is proposed by using two-microphone transfer function method and static transmission loss of mufflers. Flow noise regeneration from perforated pipe muffler of different dimensions is performed under flow condition, and the effects of main structure parameters on flow noise generation are analyzed. The study shows that total power of flow noise generation increases with the increase of perforated diameter, perforated rate and length of perforated part. Some acoustic mode frequencies from numerical simulation agree well with the peak frequencies of experimental flow noise generation. Flow field analysis indicates that flow noise generation is producing due to shear layer instability, and it excites muffler acoustics mode, leading to enlargement of flow noise regeneration. Producing mechanism of flow generated noise on perforated muffler element is clarified. The study provides the guidance on optimization of flow field inside the muffler, retraining flow generated noise and improvement of dynamic attenuating ability.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Although balancing requires that the model be asymptotically stable, it reduces the model depending only on the information of input to state and state to output. The stability requirement comes from the computation of the controllability and observability gramians which are used for characterizing the contribution of the states to the input-output map.

This is particularly evident in large, regular, and dense structures such as DRAMs. DRAMs are built using minimized transistors with presumably uniform speed in an organized array structure. Process variation can introduce latency disparity among different memory arrays. With the proliferation of 3D stacking technology, DRAMs become a favorable choice for stacking on top of a multicore processor as a last level cache for large capacity, high bandwidth, and low power. Hence, variations in bank speed create a unique problem of nonuniform cache accesses in 3D space.

In polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) remote sensing, the polarimetric calibration (PolCAL) is the key technique in quantitative earth parameter measurement. In general, the current PolCAL process can be separated into two parts. The first part tries to estimate the crosstalk and the cross-polarization (x-pol) channel imbalance components by the reflection symmetry and the reciprocity properties, without a CR. Then, at least one trihedral CR is required to determine the co-polarization (co-pol) channel imbalance; however, it is not always possible to deploy a CR in difficult terrain such as desert.

{"title": "Lipoxin A4 and Platelet Activating Factor Are Involved in E. coli or LPS-Induced Lung Inflammation in CFTR-Deficient Mice\n", "abstract": " CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is expressed by both neutrophils and platelets. Lack of functional CFTR could lead to severe lung infection and inflammation. Here, we found that mutation of CFTR (F508del) or inhibition of CFTR in mice led to more severe thrombocytopenia, alveolar neutrocytosis and bacteriosis, and lower lipoxin A4/MIP-2 (macrophage inhibitory protein-2) or lipoxin A4/neutrophil ratios in the BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) during acute E. coli pneumonia. In vitro, inhibition of CFTR promotes MIP-2 production in LPS-stimulated neutrophils; however, lipoxin A4 could dose-dependently suppress this effect. In LPS-induced acute lung inflammation, blockade of PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) or P-selectin, antagonism of PAF by WEB2086, or correction of mutated CFTR trafficking by KM11060 could significantly increase plasma lipoxin A4 levels in F508del relevant to wildtype mice. Concurrently, F508del mice had higher plasma platelet activating factor (PAF) levels and PAF-AH activity compared to wildtype under LPS challenge. Inhibiting hydrolysis of PAF by a specific PAF-AH (PAF-acetylhydrolase) inhibitor, MAFP, could worsen LPS-induced lung inflammation in F508del mice compared to vehicle treated F508del group. Particularly, depletion of platelets in F508del mice could significantly decrease plasma lipoxin A4 and PAF-AH activity and deteriorate LPS-induced lung inflammation compared to control F508del mice. Taken together, lipoxin A4 and PAF are involved in E. coli or LPS-induced lung inflammation in CFTR-deficient mice, suggesting that lipoxin A4 and PAF might be therapeutic\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "What is the prevalence of smoking in China\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of prevalence data sets on tobacco use so as to measure the risk of tobacco use and the impact of tobacco control in China. METHODS: Three published data sets on nation-wide survey were reviewed and compared. Two principles were applied to determine the accuracy of the data on prevalence: i) The estimated consumption of cigarettes based on the current prevalence rate on smokers should have been close to the actual cigarette consumption level; ii) change on the annual prevalence of male current smokers should be around 1% in China, since the international experience on the prevalence of current smokers tended to decrease at a rate of around 1% per year in the presence of comprehensive tobacco control strategies. RESULTS: The differences between the estimated cigarette consumption and the actual cigarette consumption for the three surveys were 51.07 billion through Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2002), 62.94 billion through the Chinese Citizen Nutrition & Health Survey (CCNHS 2002), and 217.11 billion through the China Health Service Survey (CHSS 2003). In comparison with the national tobacco use survey in 1996, the prevalence of male current smokers apparently dropped by 0.9% in BRFSS 2002, 2.2% in CCNHS 2002 and 2.0% per year in CHSS 2003. Thus, the prevalence of current smokers in BRFSS (2002) was more reliable, comparing to the results from the other two surveys.

An association between multiple CISH polymorphisms and susceptibility to infectious diseases has been reported. This study aimed to investigate the possible association of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CISH gene with different outcomes of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.  Methods 1019 unrelated Chinese Han subjects, including 240 persistent asymptomatic HBV carriers, 217 chronic hepatitis B patients, 137 HBV-related liver cirrhosis patients, and 425 cases of spontaneously recovered HBV as controls, were studied. Four SNPs (rs622502, rs2239751, rs414171 and rs6768300) in CISH gene were genotyped with the snapshot technique. Transcriptional activity of the CISH promoter was assayed in vitro using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system.  Results At position rs414171, A allele and AA genotype frequencies were significantly higher in the HBV-resolved group as compared to the persistent HBV infection group. At position rs2239751, TT genotype was further observed in the HBV-resolved group. Using asymptomatic HBV carriers as controls, our results indicated that the rs414171 and rs2239751 polymorphisms were unrelated to HBV progression. The other two SNPs (rs622502 and rs6768300) showed no association with persistent HBV infection. Haplotype analysis revealed that the GGCA haplotype was associated with spontaneous clearance of HBV in this population.

The aim of this study is to quantitatively summarize the relationship between this polymorphism and CRC risk. Materials and Methods: Two investigators independently searched the Medline, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Chinese Biomedicine databases for studies published before November 2013. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for VDR BsmI polymorphism and CRC were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. Results: This meta-analysis included 14 case-control studies, which included 10,822 CRC cases and 11,779 controls. Overall, the variant genotype (BB) of the BsmI was associated with a lower CRC risk when compared with the wild-type bb homozygote (OR= 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.88). Similarly, a decreased CRC risk was also found in the dominant and recessive models. When stratifying for ethnicity, source of controls, and study sample size, associations were observed among Caucasians, population-based studies and studies with large study sample size (> 1000 subjects). Limiting the analysis to the studies within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the results were persistent and robust. No publication bias was found in the present study.

Our purpose was to assess the knowledge of stroke risk factors and the level of perceived risk for stroke.  Methods In 2011, a population-based face-to-face interview survey was conducted in Yuzhong district, Chongqing. A total of 1500 potential participants aged \u0393\u00eb\u00d118 years old were selected using a multi-stage sampling method. The knowledge of stroke risk factors and perceived risk for stroke was surveyed.  Results A total of 941 participants completed the questionnaire survey. The respondents\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 awareness rate of stroke risk factors ranged between 53.3% and 87.2%. The community residents\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 perceived risk for stroke was only 17.7%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that 45\u0393\u00c7\u00f464 years age group, a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, and stroke were independent predictors of perceived risk for stroke. Perceived risk for stroke increased as the number of risk factors increased (P<0.001). However, even for respondents with three or more risk factors, only 41% perceived themselves to be at risk for stroke.  Conclusions In this population-based survey, few community residents perceived risk for stroke, even among those with multiple stroke risk factors, most did not perceive themselves to be at risk for stroke. Persons with 45\u0393\u00c7\u00f464 years old, a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, heart disease or stroke were more likely to perceive risk for stroke.

In this paper, after a series of pre-processing including edge enhancement and edge detection, the initial segmented small regions are merged according to the region distance defined by distance of coherence matrix of PolSAR data, and discrete points (at the position of edges) are merged into regions according to Wishart distance. We applied the new algorithm to NASA/JPL AIRSAR L band data of Flevoland, Netherlands.

Highly attenuated recombinant HIV vaccinia virus can be administered mucosally, but even high doses of immunization have been found unable to induce strong mucosal antibody responses. In order to solve this problem, we studied the interactions of recombinant HIV vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (rVTT-gagpol) in mucosal epithelial cells (specifically Caco-2 cell layers) and in BALB/c mice. We evaluated the impact of this virus on HIV antigen delivery and specific immune responses. The results demonstrated that rVTT-gagpol was able to infect Caco-2 cell layers and both the nasal and lung epithelia in BALB/c mice. The progeny viruses and expressed p24 were released mainly from apical surfaces. In BALB/c mice, the infection was limited to the respiratory system and was not observed in the blood. This showed that polarized distribution limited antigen delivery into the whole body and thus limited immune response. To see if this could be improved upon, we stimulated unpolarized budding of the virus and HIV antigens by treating both Caco-2 cells and BALB/c mice with colchicine. We found that, in BALB/c mice, the degree of infection and antigen expression in the epithelia went up. As a result, specific immune responses increased correspondingly. Together, these data suggest that polarized budding limits antigen delivery and immune responses, but unpolarized distribution can increase antigen expression and delivery and thus enhance specific immune responses. This conclusion can be used to optimize mucosal HIV vaccine strategies.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["19"]}

First ketones were converted to epoxynitriles with the Darzens reaction. Second, a Lewis acid mediated rearrangement of these epoxynitriles with lithium bromide was achieved to give homologated secondary alkanoic acids (as well as aryl-alkanoic) in good yields. The mechanism and the scope of the rearrangement reaction were investigated.

{"title": "Analysis of exergy of moist air and energy saving potential in HVAC by evaporative cooling energy recovery\n", "abstract": " Of evaporative cooling or energy recovery potential in HVAC, the conventional thermodynamic analysis is based on the enthalpy of moist air. In fact, the available energy of moist air is its exergy and the available energy saving potential ought to be the exergy. Isoexergic lines on psychometric charts associated with different ambient states persuade us that exergy and enthalpy are completely independent of each other. Thus, the enthalpy analysis is at least imperfect. Selecting the saturated state of moist air at ambient temperature (T0) and pressure (p0) as the dead-state, this paper analyses the exergy of moist air. It is broken down into three components: thermal, mechanical and chemical, so that each of them may be represented with a special devised diagram applicable to various conditions and ambient states among HVAC applications. Two guidelines for such applications are extracted from the diagrams as these: lower dead-state temperature (T0) with the same difference of the humidity ratio (\u2567\u00eb-\u2567\u00eb0S) is related with higher chemical exergy, and hence, the recovery of latent heat availability will probably be more valuable in winter than in summer; the exergy loss due to air flow resistance in a heat exchanger is usually small when compared with the potential of thermal and chemical exergy gaining. Further, the exergies of outdoor and exhaust room air are calculated and tabled for some Chinese cities and different types of air conditioning based on some statistic average parameters. Some general conclusions are drawn. For most districts on average room air parameters, the exhaust room air exergy is greater in winter than in summer.

The proposed approach starts with a large network, then selects important hidden neurons from the original structure using a forward selection criterion that minimizes the residual output error. Furthermore, the presented algorithm has no constraints on the network type. The efficiency of the proposed approach is evaluated based on several benchmark data sets.

The first module interpolates the coarse-scale solution with coarse-scale basis functions. Then the state covariance on the fine-scale mesh is obtained with less computational burden. The second module reconstructs coarse-scale basis functions when the model states have been updated. The proposed method is examined by synthetic cases.

New and more effective therapies are therefore urgently needed. Recent studies have shown that immunogenicity of whole ovarian tumor cells and subsequent T cell response were potentiated by oxidation modification with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in vitro and ex vivo. These results prompted us to investigate the protective antitumor response with an HOCl treated CT26 colorectal cancer cell vaccine in an in vivo mouse model. Administration of HOCl modified vaccine triggered robust antitumor immunity to autologous tumor cells in mice and prolonged survival period significantly. In addition, increased necrosis and apoptosis were found in tumor tissue from the oxidation group. Interestingly, ELISPOT assays showed that specific T cell responses were not elicited in response to the immunizing cellular antigen, in contrast to raising sera antibody titer and antibody binding activity shown by ELISA assay and flow cytometry. Further evaluation of the mechanisms underlying HOCl modified vaccine mediated humoral immunity highlighted the role of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These results combined with previous studies suggest that HOCl oxidation modified whole cell vaccine has wide applicability as a cancer vaccine because it can target both T cell-and B cell-specific responses. It may thus represent a promising approach for the immunotherapy of colorectal cancer.", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["19"]}

This offers significant advantages in applying non-uniform grids with improved accuracy. To improve the computational efficiency, we introduce the spectral element method to replace the traditional finite element method, which leads to a diagonal mass matrix with sufficient accuracy.

However, current nano-needle fabrication is usually expensive and controling the sizes and angles is complicated. We have developed a simple and low cost silicon nano-needle fabrication method using traditional microelectromechanical system (MEMS) tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) etching techniques.

This paper deals with building a regression model for predicting concrete's compressive strength. First of all, eight process variables are identified as determinants of Concrete Compressive Strength (CCS). These variables are Cement, Blast Furnace Slag, Fly Ash, Water, Superplasticizer, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate, and Age. Further, correlation among these variables is computed and it is found that a few of them are highly correlated. Therefore, interactions among these variables are taken into account. After that, a regression model is developed by regressing CCS against all process variables and significant interactions. Finally, diagnostics are conducted to fine tune the model and a parsimonious model is obtained with 84.37% coefficient of determination.

Experimental demonstration at the Tsinghua Thomson scattering x-ray source with a time resolution better than 35 fs is reported in this paper. The experimental results are successfully used to obtain information on the possible cause of the jitter and the accompanying drifts.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The surrounding rock pressure data obtained at different loess stratum are analyzed. It is found that the surrounding rock pressure distributed over the whole cross section is relative uniform. Four theory methods, namely, Terzaghi loose surrounding rock pressure theory, deep buried surrounding rock pressure formula of railway tunnel design specification, Pu's theory and Caquot theory, are used to calculate the magnitude of the surrounding rock pressure respectively and compare with the measured value. The calculation result from Terzaghi theory is closest to the measure value. Terzaghi theory is able to provide better safe allowance to some degree, so it may become the recommended method to calculate the surrounding rock pressure for deep buried large sectional loess tunnel.

The molecules are packed in stacks running parallel to the unique b axis. The two independent molecules are arranged alternately along the stack. In principle, there are two different pairs of molecules within a stack that can undergo photodimerization, and each should form a different enantiomer.

Dynamic structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) techniques along with the emergence of the computational grid offer the potential for realistic scientific and engineering simulations of complex physical phenomena. However, the inherent dynamic nature of SAMR applications coupled with the heterogeneity and dynamism of the underlying grid environment present significant research challenges. We present proactive runtime partitioning strategies based on performance prediction functions that are experimentally formulated in terms of system parameters such as CPU load and available memory. These proactive partitioning strategies form a part of the GridARM autonomic framework which enables self-managing, self-adapting, and self-optimizing SAMR applications on the grid.

METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR-DHPLC) was used to detect the polymorphism of monoamine NQO1 gene cDNA 609 site (C--> T). The frequencies of alleles and genotypes in different PD groups were compared with those of the control group. RESULTS: It was found that the frequencies of TT genotype in the patients with PD and in the controls were 0.226 and 0.118 respectively (P= 0.004), ie, TT genotype increased the risk of PD by 2.186-fold (P= 0.005). When the patients with PD were divided into two groups by the age at onset, significant difference in the genotypic frequencies was observed only between late-onset PD group and control group (the frequencies of TT genotype being 0.260 and 0.118, P= 0.001) and TT genotype increased the risk of late-onset PD by 2.627-fold (P= 0.001). There were no significant differences in frequencies of alleles between different PD groups and control group. CONCLUSION: This study revealed significant differences in genotypic frequencies between PD group and control group. The findings supported the hypothesis about an association between NQO1 gene and PD, suggesting that the age at onset of PD might be related to the putative association, and NQO1 cDNA C609T site be a risk factor for PD.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The reflection phase shift on a mirror has been calculated employing the Transfer-Matrix Method and the values of FSR have been calculated under the condition of normal incidence of light beam. Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities have been fabricated employing bulk micromachining technology, and silicon wafers coated with multiplayer dielectric films were used as mirrors. FSR of these FP cavities have been experimentally measured. The experimental data match the calculated results very well.

METHODS: Ventricular myocytes from neonatal Wistar rats were cultured, and the transmembrane action potentials were recorded with glass microelectrodes before and after addition of DON at different concentrations. The cultured cardiomyocytes were pretreated with 0.5 mg/L selenium (as sodium selenite) to observe the protective effects of selenium against the effects of DON. RESULTS: DON at concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mg/L decreased the action potential parameters including action potential amplitude (APA), overshoot (OS), threshold potential (TP), maximum rate of depolarization (Vmax) and action potential discharging frequency (APF), and prolonged the action potential duration of 10%, 50% and 90% repolarization (APD (10), APD (50) and APD (90)). Some of the parameters, such as APA, Vmax, APD and APF, changed in a concentration-dependent manner. The cultured cardiomyocytes pretreated with 0.5 mg/L of selenium for about 16 h presented only slight changes in action potential parameters induced by 200 mg/L DON. CONCLUSIONS: DON inhibit the membrane action potentials of cardiomyocytes, suggesting DON may interfere with the transmembrane movement of Ca (2+) and K (+), and sodium selenite may decrease the toxic effect of DON on cultured cardiomyocytes.", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Behavioral and cognitive effects of electromagnetic field exposures\n", "abstract": " The human brain is comprised of more than 100 billion individual nerve cells that are functionally interconnected into systems. These systems construct our perceptions and cognitions of the world, and control how we react to the external world (Kandel et al., 2000). This chapter presents an overview of the interaction of nonionizing electromagnetic fields (EMFs) as external stimuli to the nervous systems and the behavior of humans and laboratory animals. This overview of the scientific literature specifically includes the detection of EMFs and effects of EMFs on behavioral performance and cognition. EMF detection by humans and responses of laboratory animals suggests that detection could motivate changes in behaviors. The chapter is divided into two parts, which are distinguished simply by frequency: microwave (MW) radio frequency and extremely low-frequency (ELF). This chapter extends the findings of recent reviews of the animal and human research literature (Hermann and Hossmann, 1997; D\u0393\u00c7\u00d6Andrea, 1999; Cook et al., 2002; D\u0393\u00c7\u00d6Andrea et al., 2003a, b; Hossmann and Hermann, 2003). Biological effects of MWs occur due to absorption of energy in the body. Microwave absorption by water molecules has a resonant frequency in the region of 2.45 GHz that causes heating by molecular vibration and is the result of the interaction of MWs and tissue of the body. Water is the molecular component of tissue known to have a resonant frequency that could contribute to the absorption of MW energy. Heating (absolute temperature rise) is the best understood mechanism for the effective transfer of MW energy into tissue.

The purity of Ti3SiC2 powders analyzed by XRD was determined by RIR method, which is a semi-quantitative XRD analysis. The results showed that the purity of Ti3SiC2 powders is about 96%. Cf/Ti3SiC 2-SiC composites are obtained by polymer infiltration and pyrolysis process using Ti3SiC2 powders as the inert fillers. The bending strength of Cf/Ti3SiC2-SiC composites was about 160 MPa.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Dimensionality reduction using compressed sensing and its application to a large-scale visual recognition task\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a novel algorithm for the dimensionality reduction which employs compressed sensing (CS) to improve the generalization capability of a classifier, especially for large-scale data. Compared to traditional dimensionality reduction methods, the proposed algorithm makes no use of the problem-dependent parameters, nor does it require additional computation for the eigenvalue decomposition like PCA or LDA. Mathematically, the derived algorithm regards the input features as the dictionary in CS, and selects the features that minimize the residual output error iteratively, thus the resulting features have a direct correspondence to the performance requirements of the given problem. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be regarded as a sparse classifier, which selects discriminative features and classifies the training data simultaneously. Experimentally, the CS-based algorithm is tested with a\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "Emission characteristic analysis of urban domestic pollution sources in China\n", "abstract": " Ever since china entered the period of rapid urbanization in the late eighties last century, the urban domestic pollution sources have become the major source of most urban water pollution. However, the current literature both at home and aboard rarely involves the analysis of pollution source emission characteristics. In this paper, the author chooses the consumption level and the disposable income of urban residents as the emission characteristic indicators of urban domestic pollution sources, building the statistical model of urban domestic pollution sources. Based on this, the author divided china into 5 regions and 25 categories, investigating the reasons of the urban life emission characteristic differences between these regions, providing decision support for more actively controlling the pollution and guiding the economical and social development.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Experimental Research of Glass Surface Modification Based on Wire Exploding Spray Coating Technology [J]\n", "abstract": " In order to develop an electrical conducting film onto the dielectric substrate, such as glass and ceramic, to enhance their surface performances, the Wire Exploding Spray Coating (WESC) method is applied to deposit a thick copper film onto the inner surface of a glass tube. The electrical diagram and the schematic diagram of the spray coating chamber is given. The film obtained by WESC method at the atmosphere pressure and room temperature is more uniform when a higher discharging voltage between the copper wire is used, which means more energy is deposited into the copper wire, and the wire will be destructed more efficiently. But the glass tube will fall to pieces if the voltage is above 22 kV, which will cause a strong shock wave, and a 20 kV discharging voltage is applied in this paper. A series of tests have been done to the film, the adhesive strength between the copper film and the glass substrate is 2.632 MPa by a direct pull-off test. The SEM photograph shows that the copper particle penetrates deeply into the glass substrate, which causes a strong adhesion between the film and substrate, and the thickness of the film is about 400 to 500 \u256c\u255dm after being sprayed three times. The electrical conductivity of the copper film is about 1.837\u251c\u00f9 104 \u256c\u2310-1m-1 tested by a Kelvin electric bridge, and the 50 Hz withstand voltage of the glass tube before and after the spray coating is about 40 kV and 38 kV, respectively, without obviously decrease.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The ash beds in the time-equivalent strata, even in different areas display rather similar geochemical features, whereas the ash beds in different strata even in the same areas show large chemical difference. The results suggest that these ash beds can be used for intra- and extra-basinal correlations of the Sinian- Early Cambrian interval on the Yangtze Platform. Additionally, these ash beds suggest high potentials for further U-Pb dating strategies.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["19"]}

METHODS: The polymorphisms of NQO1 and ApoE gene were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 92 SAD patients and 108 normal controls, all of Han nationality. RESULTS: The frequencies of mutant T allele and T/C+ T/T genotype at nucleotide position 609 of NQO1 gene were 56% and 89% respectively in the patients with SAD, significantly higher than those in the controls (45% and 71% respectively) with an odds ratio of 1.56 (for mutant T allele) and of 3.301 (for genotype) respectively. The frequency of the ApoE2 allele was significantly lower in the SAD patients than in the controls (chi (2)= 3.753, P< 0.05) and the frequency of ApoE4 was higher in the SAD patients, however, without a statistically significant difference (chi (2)= 1.863, P= 0.172).

METHODS: A total of 126 Chinese patients with maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility were studied, including 105 cases of ABO type and 21 cases of Rh type incompatibility. The traditional Chinese herbal medicine was used for preventative treatment in 79 cases, and 47 cases served as controls. The prescription consisted of Herba leonuri 500 g, white peony root 180 g, Banksia rose 12 g, root of Chinese angelica 150 g and Rhizomal ligustica 150 g. RESULTS: Preventative treatment with traditional Chinese herbal medicine significantly reduced the perinatal mortality rate in cases of Rh type incompatibility, from 50.0% in the control group to 7.7% in the treatment group (P< 0.05). There was no death in the cases of ABO incompatibility. The traditional Chinese herbal medicine also decreased the degree of hemolysis. The percentage of severe cases in the control group was 29.8%, while it was 15.2% in the treatment group (P= 0.05). The duration of treatment was closely related to the outcomes. In patients who used traditional Chinese herbal medicine for more than 10 weeks, the incidence of severe hemolysis was 8.2%, compared with 38.9% in those treated for less than 10 weeks (P< 0.05). The change of serum immune antibody (A and/or B) titers during the treatment was a very important predictive factor for the outcome of the pregnancy.

Variations of the S parameter with respect to incident positron energy were observed. For pure hydrocarbons PP, HDPE and oxygen-containing polymer PC, S parameter rises with increasing positron implantation depth. While for PI and fluoropolymers like PTFE, ETFE and PVF, S parameter decreases with higher positron energy.

Almost all JCNS instruments are equipped with large-area position sensitive detectors allowing for simultaneous data collection in a wide range of the momentum transfer Q, in order to achieve the maximal possible efficiency of the scattered neutrons. As it is well known that polarization analysis always results in a significant intensity penalty (practically a factor of about 10), we pay special attention to the polarization analysis of neutron beams scattered in a wide angle spanned by such large-area detectors to compensate for above-", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The main aims of this paper are trying to control the pore structure of the polymer. The emulsifier system, including an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), an anionic-nonionic mixture of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Tween 80 (T80), could be used to prepare stable, transparent microemulsion. The microemulsion phase diagrams of the system consisting of surfactants, H2O/EtOH and MMA/BA are shown. The resulting polymers were studied by SEM. The oil-absorption property of the resin was determined. The effects of emulsion system, the content of aqueous phase, ratio of monomers, the content of crosslinker and initiator on oil absorption capacity of the prepared resin were disussed. The SEM results indicated the formation of a bicontinuous structure in the high oil-absorption resin at mixture aqueous concentrations between 30 wt% and 50 wt%. The pore size or the width of the polymerized bicontinuous microemulsions increased substantially with the increase of the aqueous content (30 wt%~ 50 wt%) in precursor microemulsions. This total polymerization approach enables one to synthesize various bicontinuous nanostructures polymeric materials by simply adjusting the concentrations of aqueous in precursor bicontinuous microemulsions. The results indicated that the porous high oil-absorption resin could reach oil balance in two minutes with aqueous content 50 wt%.

As increasing ball-milling time, average particle size and crystallite size decreased and the amount of SiO2, carbon, some metal lic impurities and lattice strain increased for the ball-milled powder. The increase of SiO2 was ascribed to the mechanochemical reaction of H2O contained in the milling fluid with newly formed pow der surfaces. The source of carbon was both the milling fluid and the container. The increase of Al and Mg was explained by the wear of milling balls.

However, this interaction is difficult to observe at the atomic level. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the structural formation of polymer chains induced by the highly oriented slab or the stretched bundle of polymer chains. The results show that the surface-induced crystallization of polymer chains is greatly influenced by the foreign surface on the crystal structure and the morphology of the polymers, hence providing molecular-level support for previous experimental observations [Lotz et al.

As initialization, the Wishart H/ alpha classification result is divided into 16 classes according to the PWF result. Then after another Wishart iteration, the final result would be got. The experimental results show that the PWF result has more information that the H, alpha and A parameters don't contain.

Yet in practice, the training dataset may contain a substantial number of flows labeled as 'unknown', including both the flows from classes that are not modeled by the classifier, and the unrecognized flows from modeled classes.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised multivariate decision tree classification algorithm, based on adaptive hierarchical clustering. Rather than using Gini index or information gain relying on perfect training dataset, we use adaptive hierarchical clustering, to construct the decision tree.

METHOD: Four-year old P. quinquefolium was cultivated in water and soil cultures. Biological assays were conducted with the aqueous extracts of P. quinquefolius, Fructus Perillae and roots of Coix lacryma-jobi. P. quinquefolium was cultivated in the soil where purple Perilla frutesens and C. lacryma-jobi were grown previously. The effects of rotation were determined. RESULT: The stems, leaves and fibrous roots of Panax quinquefolium contained allelopathic substances. When the concentration of the allelopathic substances exceeded 1g per kg soil, P. quinquefolius could not grow. On the other hand, when the concentration of allelopathic substances fell below 0.2 g per kg soil, the rate of seedling growth was decreased by 25%.

{"title": "The incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in Chinese populations\n", "abstract": " OBJECTIVE: To study the ratio of ischemic to hemorrhagic stroke incidence in Chinese populations. METHODS: Fifteen populations in China, each including about 100,000 residents, were monitored from 1991 to 2000 for the occurrence of stroke. Stroke was classified as hemorrhagic, ischemic and unclassified based on the clinical data and CT scan results respectively. RESULTS: The average CT scan rate in stroke patients from 1996 to 2000 varied from 14.8% to 97.5% among the 15 population and the average ratio of ischemic to hemorrhagic stroke ranged from 0.23: 1 to 4.38: 1; the correlation coefficient between the ratio and CT scan rate is 0.7 (P= 0.003). In all the populations with CT scan rate greater than 80%, the ischemic to haemorrhagic ratios were all greater than 1.0. From 1991 to 2000 in 12 populations with complete data, the CT scan rate in stroke patients rose from 41.1% to 88.3% and the ischemic to hemorrhagic ratio rose from 1.25: 1 to 1.85: 1. The correlation coefficient between the ratio and the CT scan rate was 0.9 (P< 0.001). In patients having CT scan, the ischemic to hemorrhagic ratio was greater than 1.0 in all the years. CONCLUSION: The predominant type of stroke in Chinese population is ischemic. The low CT scan rate in some populations is the main reason for the false impression predominantly hemorrhagic stroke.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Isothermal dimensional recovery behavior was studied for the free stress state of the deformed sample. It was shown that the dimensional recovery behavior of samples drawn near T g was different from that of a sample drawn about 20\u252c\u2591C above T g, indicating that the deformation mechanisms changed when the drawing temperature rose from near T g to far above T g. Recovery curves of samples drawn near T g show two distinct steps in log time scale; the second step follows a single exponential function.

HMM is a powerful parametric model for non-stationary pattern recognition and is feasible for characterisation of a doubly stochastic process involving observable actions and a hidden decision making process. The control strategy is encoded by HMMs through a training process. The trained model is then employed to control the system. The proposed method has been investigated by simulations of a linear system and an inverted pendulum system. The HMM-based controller provides a novel way to learn control strategy and to model the human decision making process.< >", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["19"]}

STUDY DESIGN: Twelve cases of NGOC with lung metastases treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1982-2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The 12 cases included 9 pure NGOCs and 3 mixed with other germ cell tumors (mature teratoma, endodermal sinus tumor and embryonal carcinoma components, and dysgerminoma, respectively). Chemotherapy was given in all 12 cases, mainly including EMA/CO, BEP, and RESULTS: The median age for the cases was 23.9 years. Abdominal pain was the most common symptom (7/12). Follow-up was available for 11 cases, ranging from 17-174 months (median, 86.6 months). Of those, only 1 patient died of the disease, at 42 months from the disease onset. The other patient for whom follow-up was not available gave up treatment due to chemoresistance and disease progression. An overall sustained remission had been achieved in 10 cases (83.3%). CONCLUSION: Surgery combined with the appropriate chemotherapy regimen can improve therapeutic efficacy and survival in the treatment of NGOC with lung metastasis, even in recurrent or chemorefractory cases. Commencement of EMA/CO chemotherapy, which seems to be associated with better prognosis, should be considered as a good choice of treatment.

The matrix effects (MEs) in the analysis of the three compounds with the developed method were determined. The influences of matrix state and its weight on MEs were evaluated statistically. The analytes in pig liver and muscle and their corresponding freeze-dried powders were derivatized with N, O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide. Then the derivatives were determined in selected ion monitoring mode and the intensities of MEs of the three beta-agonists were obtained. Significant matrix enhancement was observed for the three analytes, and especially, the ME of ractopamine was more than 1000%. The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that MEs were significantly different for the three analytes in two matrices among different matrix weights (P< 0.05), and MEs of the three analytes increased from 1 g to 5 g with the increase of matrix weight. MEs for the three analytes were not significantly different between fresh pig tissues and its freeze-dried powder matrices (P> 0.05), indicating that the freeze-dried powder matrices might be used to conveniently prepare the matrix-matched calibration solution, which could efficiently compensate the MEs of the beta-agonists in GC-MS analysis.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "Modelling of fundamental transfer processes in crude-oil fouling\n", "abstract": " Crude-oil fouling commonly occurs at the heat transfer surfaces of oil refinery pre-heat trains, reducing the heat transfer and hydrodynamic efficiency of heat exchangers. The underlying mechanisms of this process must be understood to design effective fouling mitigation strategies. Fouling is believed to proceed via several individual steps: initiation, transportation, attachment, removal and ageing. However, the mechanisms of initiation, removal and ageing of the fouling layer are not yet fully known. Current models for crude-oil fouling are mostly based on relatively simple empirical or semi-empirical correlations that are only accurate for specific crude oils under certain conditions and have no solid chemical or physical basis. It is therefore essential to develop an accurate comprehensive numerical fouling model and to understand the underlying physical and chemical processes.

{"title": "Peak Detection for Infrared Spectrum Based on Continuous Wavelet Transform\n", "abstract": " In spectrum analysis, peak detection is an essential step for subsequent analysis. Traditionally, peak detection procedure is divided into three consequent parts: smoothing, baseline correction and peak finding. The existing peak detection method based on continuous wavelet transform can combine the baseline correction and peak finding into one part. It simplified the traditional peak detection procedure, but this method still has two parts. A method based on continuous wavelet transform which finishes the three parts at a time was proposed in this study. The baseline\u0393\u00c7\u2593 s function of original signal is monotone and linear, so after wavelet transform, there is no information of baseline in the wavelet coefficients. What we need do is deal with the coefficients. First, remove the noise in the coefficients based on Liapunov Exponent. Then, find the ridge mentioned in this study. The position of ridge is the peak\u0393\u00c7\u2593 s position. The proposed method further simplifies the peak detection procedure.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["19"]}

METHODS: Screening by maternal serum markers for Down's syndrome was offered to all 2886 pregnant women in Peking Union Medical Hospital during 1996.11-2001.3. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (free beta-HCG) were used as markers during the first year of pregnancy. Alpha-fetoprotein, free human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) were used as mid pregnancy and first-trimester markers in next three years. Amniocentesis and (CVS) were done in those defined as risk cases. RESULTS: The detection rate of Down's syndrome by maternal serum markers was 3.8%(11/2886). The proportion of false positive results in group of triple markers (alpha FP, free beta-HCG, PAPP-A) was 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The PAPP-A was a good marker to detect Down's syndrome in early pregnancy and may be used to predict the outcome during mid trimester of pregnancy. The AFP and free beta-HCG can be useful markers to detect Down's syndrome and fetal abnormality. While prenatal diagnostics can be shifted to an early pregnant period.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Effect of different water management and nitrogen forms on characteristics of iron nutrition of rice cultivated under aerobic condition\n", "abstract": " Although available iron is usually abundant for the growth of rice cultivated in waterlogged condition, but rice crop may suffer from its deficiency when cultivated in aerobic soil since the soil properties are totally different from waterlogged. Solubility of iron is very low in soils with high Eh and/or high pH. A field experiment with five different depths (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm) of groundwater, and a pot-experiment with five treatments of ammonium-nitrate ratio (100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100) were conducted to study the characteristics of iron nutrition of rice in non-full irrigation condition. Moreover, the contents of iron extracted by 1 mol. L-1 HC1 from rice plant samples of 8 cultivars from both aerobic and waterlogged cultivation were analyzed to study the effect of water regimes on iron content of rice plants. The results were as follows:(1) The average content of available Fe (2. 70 mg. kg-1) of 5 layers of the soil treated with 10-cm depth of groundwater was significantly higher than that (0. 83 mg. kg-1) with 50-cm depth of ground-water, and the iron concentration of rice plant of the former was much higher than that of the later.(2) Iron deficiency of rice became much severe when high ratio of nitrate (more than 75 percent) in nitrogen fertilizer applied at different intervals in aerobic cultivation.(3) The iron concentrations of 3 cultivars, Wuyujing 3 (99 mg. kg-1), Yangdao4 (87 mg. kg-1) and 9520 (95 mg. kg-1) of rice plants cultivated in aerobic condition were significantly less than those (195, 197 and 175 mg. kg-1 respectively) in waterlogged condition at tillering stage.

In the spontaneous state, the magneto-optical effects originate mainly from the intra-ionic electric dipole transitions between the 4 f 3 and 4 f 25d states split by the spin-orbit, crystal field, and superexchange interactions. For the excited configuration, the coupling scheme of Yanase is extended to the Nd 3+ ion. The magneto-optical resonance frequencies are mainly determined by the splitting of the 5d states induced by the crystal field. The theoretical results of both Nd magnetization and Faraday rotation are in good agreement with experiments. The observed Faraday rotation is proved to be of the paramagnetic type.

Healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: Normal control group (NC group) and HPH group (eight rats respectively), HPH+ MSCs transplantation group and HPH+ VEGF+ MSCs transplantation group (twenty-four respectively). The test employed atmospheric intermittent low oxygen method to establish the rat model of pulmonary hypertension and stem cells were transferred and transplanted. The rats' mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was observed; right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) was calculated; the morphological change of lung small artery in various groups of rats was observed under the microscope; the distribution of lung small artery and adenovirus transfection fluorescently labeled MSCs was observed under a fluorescent microscope after 7, 14 and 28 days when stem cell was transplanted. For NC group, the mPAP (mmHg) was 15.5+/-1.5 after twenty-eight days while the mPAPs for HPH, MSCs and MSCs+ VEGF were 26.1+/-1.9, 21.6+/-2.7 and 20.1+/-2.9 respectively which were apparently higher than that of NC group (P< 0.01) and compared with HPH group (P< 0.01), which declined clearly.

The purpose of this study was to obtain evidence of a genetic basis of EC in Xin-an and Xin-xiang counties in China. Familial aggregation and complex segregation analyses were performed of 79 EC families in these counties. The heritability of EC was examined using Falconer's method and complex segregation analysis was conducted with the SEGREG program in Statistical Analysis for Genetic Epidemiology (SAGE version 5.3. 1). The results showed that the distribution of EC in families did not fit well into a binomial distribution. The heritability of EC among first-degree and second-degree relatives was $67.0 {\\pm} 7.31% $ and $43.1%{\\pm} 9.80% $, respectively, and the summing up powered heritability was $53.2 {\\pm} 6.74% $. The segregation ratio was 0.045. Complex segregation analysis showed that the genetic model of EC was additive. The current results provide evidence for an inherited propensity to EC in certain high-risk groups in China, and support efforts to identify the genes that confer susceptibility to this disease.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "An approach to minimizing downtime induced by taking live snapshot of virtual cluster\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing has emerged as a new computing paradigm which is adopted by more and more application services based on cluster computing. Live snapshot technology is usually used to ensure the reliability of data and high availability of the running virtual machines. However, existing virtual machine live snapshot technologies are not enough to minimize the downtime induced by taking live snapshot for an entire virtual cluster consisting of a large number of virtual machines. An ordinary approach is taking live snapshot of all virtual machines belonging to the virtual cluster concurrently. But this approach may induce a long downtime of an entire virtual cluster which consists of a large number of virtual machines distributed in a small number of hosts. To address this challenge, this paper surveys the factors which raise the downtime of virtual machines induced by taking live snapshot, and defines five metrics\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

In this paper, a new gradient controlled proportionate adaptation technique is proposed for AEC. A time-averaging gradient estimate is assigned as the gain distribution vector to assign individual step sizes so that the filter taps are updated proportionally to the magnitude of the mean of the gradient vector. Based on this new proportionate technique, we propose the gradient-controlled improved proportionate affine projection algorithm (GC-IPAPA), and gradient-controlled improved proportionate normalized least mean square algorithm (GC-IPNLMS).

Results showed that ORYZA2000 model could present water requirements of aerobic rice for the whole growth season satisfactorily with RE relative error ranging from 13.0% to 21.5%, which mainly resulted from simulation inaccuracy at the stage of emergence to PI.

The results show that when the hydraulic loading varies from 2.4 to 6.7 m3/(m2\u252c\u2556 d), the sludge reduction and stabilization can be realized with both filter media. The sludge and VSS reduction rates in earthworm biofilter with ceramsite are 40.5% to 48.2% and 52.9% to 65.6% respectively, which are superior to those in earthworm biofilter with quartz sand. Sludge treatment in earthworm biofilter is realized when earthworms grow in the filter media. Therefore the living environment provided by filter media affects sludge treatment performance directly. The observation of the body wall tissue of earthworms by SEM indicates that the injured cuticle, epidermis and central muscle in ceramsite media are slighter than those in quartz sand. The effect of filter media on superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of earthworm was also investigated, and the results show that the SOD activity of earthworm in ceramsite media is significantly lower than that in quartz sand under any working condition.

Contrary to the prediction from the classical Reynolds\u0393\u00c7\u00d6 theory, simulation results show that the load capacity of the nanoscale bearing does not increase monotonically with the operation speed. This is attributed to the change of the local shear rate, which will decrease with the shear velocity of the bearing as the shear velocity exceeds a critical value, i.e., the local shear rate has an upper limit. A simple nonlinear dynamic model indicates that the momentum exchange between the liquid and the solid wall is reduced with the shear velocity when the shear velocity is above a critical value. The weak momentum exchange results in a decrease of the local shear rate, which in turn causes a sharp increase of the slip length.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

At each step of the wildfire simulation, the ARM decomposes the computational domain into several natural regions (e.g., burning, unburned, burned) where each region has the same temporal and special characteristics.

The swelling behavior of montmorillonite in water was studied. The effects of the mass fraction of montmorillonite, swelling time and the addition of NaCl on the rheological behavior of the suspension were investigated by a MC1 rheometer. The results show that when the solids content is lower (\u0393\u00eb\u00f1 3.0%, mass fraction, the same below), the suspension is a Newton liquid, and the suspension becomes a pre-plastic liquid when the montmorillonite content is\u0393\u00eb\u00d1 5.0%. According to the change of the content of montmorillonite in water, it takes several to tens hours for montmorillonite to realize full swelling and exfoliation. But the time for the exfoliation of montmorillonite in water can be shortened to 10 min by using ultrasonic wave dispersion treatment. The flocculation and network structure of montmorillonite layers can be formed by the addition of NaCl. The suspension liquid viscosity, especially under a low shear rate, can be increased for several times. The measurement result for the rheological behaviors of the suspension liquids with different solid fluid dispersed phase ratios indicates that there is an interaction between the double electric layers of the montmorillonite lamellar and the double electric layers of the emulsion droplets, resulting in the particular viscosity change.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

In this study, two groups of 16 subjects were presented with either visual or auditory stimuli denoting common animals (eg, dog, cat) and tools (hammer, saw) in a rapid event-related fMRI paradigm. Visual stimuli consisted of grayscale photographs and printed names; auditory stimuli consisted of representative audio clips of animal and tool sounds and spoken names. Stimuli represented 15 different objects from each category with five exemplars of each type, yielding 75 items per condition. During scanning, subjects were asked to perform category decision task or naming task. A voxel-wise mixed-effect ANOVA identified a number of brain regions showing category-related activity, including dorsal amygdala activations that were greater for identifying animals than tools in both tasks. Further analysis revealed significant differences between animals and tools in the right amygdala for each of the different stimulus formats in the naming task; most strongly for naming animal pictures and sounds. In categorization task, right amygdala showed significant category-related effects for pictures and sounds as well. In tandem with previous results showing enhanced amygdala activity for identifying faces and interpreting animate geometric shapes, these data suggest that the amygdala may be part of the neural circuitry involved in identifying any animate entity.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Transient forebrain ischemia in a duration of 15 min was induced by the sue of the 4-vessel occlusion method in rats. Single L-type calcium currents were recorded in cell-attached patches of actually dissociated hippocampal CA1 neurons. After ischemia, average total patch current of L-type Ca~(2+) channels significantly increased in CA1 neurons when compared with that of control. This ischemia-induced enhancement in channel function was due to a higher channel open probablity. Further analysis of single channel kinetics showed a prolonged open time and an increased opening frequency in postischemic channels. It is suggested that the functional enhancement in L-type calcium channels may partially account for the postischemic increase in intracellular Ca~(2+) concentration of CA1 neurons following ischemia.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Experimental results indicate that the length recovery look place in two distinct steps: a fast first step (fast relaxation) followed by a slow second step (slow relaxation). The relaxation processes were accompanied by the reversion of trans-conformers (1340 cm (-1)) to gauche, and the dichroic function of the 1340 cm (-1) band characterizing the segmental orientation along the chain direction decreased to a very low value at the end of the fast relaxation. This fact led us to assign the fast relaxation as the segmental orientation while the slow relaxation as relaxation of the global chain orientation. It was found that the slow relaxation follows a single exponential function, with relaxation times strongly dependent on the temperature resembling the glass transition process. The fast relaxation does not follow a single exponential decay, presumably a distribution of relaxation times is involved.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The compressibility equation of C 2H 5OH/H 2Owas amended, and the theory is accorded with the real. Because SBSFS is sensitive to the compressibility of binary solution, we can study the thermodynamical attribution of binary solution and conjucture intermolelar interactions and microcosmical composition.", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "An ionospheric occultation inversion technique based on epoch difference\n", "abstract": " Of the ionospheric radio occultation (IRO) electron density profile (EDP) retrievals, the Abel based calibrated TEC inversion (CTI) is the most widely used technique. In order to eliminate the contribution from the altitude above the RO satellite, it is necessary to utilize the calibrated TEC to retrieve the EDP, which introduces the error due to the coplanar assumption. In this paper, a new technique based on the epoch difference inversion (EDI) is firstly proposed to eliminate this error. The comparisons between CTI and EDI have been done, taking advantage of the simulated and real COSMIC data. The following conclusions can be drawn: the EDI technique can successfully retrieve the EDPs without non-occultation side measurements and shows better performance than the CTI method, especially for lower orbit mission; no matter which technique is used, the inversion results at the higher altitudes are better than those\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["19"]}

When hydraulic load reaches 6.7 m3/(m2 xd), the concentration of COD, BOD5, SS, NH4 (+)-N and TP in earthworm bio-filter effluent increases obviously, but the TN concentration in effluent presents descending tendency. The earthworms become rather inadaptable to the living conditions at this operating mode. As hydraulic load increasing, the earthworms' relative ingestive ability is improved at first, and then decreases. The earthworms' relative ingestive ability comes to the maximum at hydraulic load of 4.8 m3/(m2 xd), with good organic removal efficiency. The relation ships between hydraulic load and average weight, average density, unit-area biomass of the earthworms are significant negative correlation. The hydraulic load of 4.8 m3/(m2 xd) is recommended, but not over 6.7 m3/(m2 xd).", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The clay-supported initiator and the structure of PS/MMT nanocomposite were characterized by XRD, TGA, DSC, TEM and extraction method. The results indicated the successful intercalation of initiator molecules in the galleries of clay layers since the MMT-supported initiator showed increased d-spacing values and more weight loss in the temperature range of 200~ 600\u0393\u00e4\u00e2. During polymerization, the initiator intercalated in the layers of MMT decomposed to produce radicals that initiated the polymerization of styrene. The decomposition of initiator also caused the exfoliation of MMT layers. In the PS/MMT emulsion, the layers of MMT were adhered on the surface of polymer particles. The final nanocomposites were formed by coagulation and melting. In nanocomposites, the layers of MMT were uniformly dispersed in polymer matrix. Some MMT layers were fully exfoliated into individual ones, and the others dominantly existed as nano-aggregates with thickness of around 10~(20 nm.)

This article provides an analytical review of some pertinent works in HVAC application. Some general conclusions can be obtained. Exergy efficiency is more rational than energy efficiency; exergy analysis is more helpful than energy analysis for locating and evaluating available energy saving potentials, identifying opportunities for improvements in system design and establishing cost effective system mainte-nance programs. In addition, an unusual selection of dead\u0393\u00c7\u00f4states novel to HVAC applications is suggested, which simplifies the exergy analysis by eliminating the necessity of calculating the exergy of water at ambient temperature (T0).

{"title": "Model reduction of flexible manipulators\n", "abstract": " Flexible manipulators can be characterized by a dynamic model with a large number of vibration modes, and the use of the model in the model-based control schemes requires reduction of model order. Balanced truncation is an effective method for model reduction of asymptotically stable systems by transforming the states to a coordinate system in which the controllability and observability Gramians are equal and diagonal, and eliminating the states which contribute weakly to the input-output map. An elastic flexible manipulator, however, is a marginally stable system and thus the balanced truncation method can not be directly applied. In this report, we present a method of reducing the order of a marginally stable system based on the fact that translation transformations in the frequency domain preserve input-output properties of the system. We address the successful application of the method to model reduction of flexible manipulators with infinite-dimensional for finite-dimensional model. The method is also applicable for any other marginally stable model, such as elastic space trusswork and multi-dimensional space vehicle structure.Descriptors:", "num_citations": "5\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "The role of disturbance waves in nucleate boiling in annular flow\n", "abstract": " In annular two-phase gas-liquid flow, the liquid film on the wall consists of relatively quiescent substrate regions which are traversed by large amplitude, high velocity waves known as disturbance waves. The turbulent disturbance wave regions have relatively high average heat transfer coefficients (low average wall temperatures) compared to the (probably laminar) substrate regions. Nevertheless, there is evidence that nucleate boiling (necessitating a higher wall temperature) occurs first in the wave regions. This paper explores the hypothesis that wall temperature fluctuations due to turbulence in the disturbance waves are of sufficient magnitude to give localized triggering of nucleation sites and hence nucleate boiling. This hypothesis was explored using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The turbulence was modelled using wall-resolved LES.

Based on the X-Bragg rough surface scattering model, we investigate the capability of compact polarimetry, a dual-polarized system, for sea surface scattering characterization, and find that the circular-transmit-and-linear-receive (CTLR) mode has a better potential for sea surface representation. Then three parameters are used to discriminate the target scattering properties at sea. These parameters allow distinguishing oil spills from two kinds of look-a-likes, i.e., biogenic slicks and low-wind areas, and show good performance for ship detection.

METHODS: Clinical data of 91 patients with Crohn disease undergoing intestinal resection from 1990 to 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the risk factors of anastomotic leak. RESULTS: A total of 120 intestinal anastomosis were performed in 91 patients, and anastomosis leak occurred in 14 patients (11.7%). Univariate analysis showed that operative timing (emergency or elective surgery), anastomosis type (side-to-side or end to end and end-to-side), operative time (\u0393\u00eb\u00d1 3 h or< 3 h), methods of anastomosis (handsewn or stapled) were the risk factors for anastomotic leak (P< 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that emergency surgery (OR= 3.891, 95% CI: 1.332-13.692), end to end and end-to-side anastomosis (OR= 3.236, 95% CI: 1.165-11.950), handsewn anastomosis (OR= 5.715, 95% CI: 1.454-17.328) were independent risk factors of anastomotic leak.

In this study, the sinoatrial node (SAN) samples from New Zealand rabbits were prepared, and intracellular recording technique was used to elucidate the effect of AEA on the action potential (AP) of SAN pacemaker cells of rabbits and the mechanism. Different concentrations of AEA (1, 10, 100, 200, 500 nmol/L) were applied cumulatively. For some SAN samples, cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonist AM251, cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor antagonist AM630, potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) and nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-nitro-arginine methylester (L-NAME) were used before AEA treatment, respectively. We found that:(1) AEA (100, 200 and 500 nmol/L) not only shortened AP duration (APD), but also decreased AP amplitude (APA)(P< 0.05).(2) AM251, but not AM630, abolished the effect of AEA on APD shortening.(3) TEA and L-NAME had no influence on the AEA effect. These findings suggest that anandamide can decrease APA and shorten APD in SAN pacemaker cells of rabbits, which may be mediated by activation of CB1 receptors, and is related to blockade of calcium channels but not potassium channels and NO.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "Context effects on embodied representation of language concepts\n", "abstract": " Embodied theories claim that semantic representations are grounded in sensorimotor systems, but the contribution of sensorimotor brain areas in representing meaning is still controversial. One current debate is whether activity in sensorimotor areas during language comprehension is automatic. Numerous neuroimaging studies reveal activity in perception and action areas during semantic processing that is automatic and independent of context, but increasing findings show that involvement of sensorimotor areas and the connectivity between word-form areas and sensorimotor areas can be modulated by contextual information. Context Effects on Embodied Representation of Language Concepts focuses on these findings and discusses the influences from word, phrase, and sentential contexts that emphasize either dominant conceptual features or non-dominant conceptual features.

Secondly, the relationships between the slopes related to different error curves and the temperatures of key thermal points are figured out by using neural networks when concerning thermal effects.

Base on comprehensive interpretation and analyses of the geological and geophysical data, and constructed regional geological section across the basin, the Mesozoic and Cenozoic fault systems of the Sunwu-Jiayin basin were studied and the evolution of the basin discussed. The results show that the whole Sunwu-Jiayin basin is a faulted basin controlled by early Cretaceous NNE extensional faults that occurred during the deposition period of the Ningyuancun formation. The Jiayin region, which is located in the eastern part of the study area, was uplifted and suffered erosion during the early stage of the deposition period of the Taoqihe formation, while the Sunwu region in the western part remained to be a faulted basin. The Jiayin region evolved as a depression, whereas the Sunwu region was uplift and subjected to erosion during the late stage of the deposition period of the Taoqihe formation. Then the whole basin entered the depression phase due to the thermal subsidence after rifting, and received a wide deposition during the late Cretaceous. The basin suffered compression again at the end of the late Cretaceous, causing reactivation and reversion of the early faults. Since the Cenozoic, the compression stress has all along been existing in the study area, and a set of NWW-trending right-lateral transpressional strike-slip faults were thereby formed.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Effects of Puer Tea on Hyperlipidemia Prevention, Antioxidation and Vascular Endothelium Protection in SD Rats [J]\n", "abstract": " To explore the effects and mechanisms of Puer tea on hyperlipidemia prevention, antioxidation, vascular endothelium protection. Hyperlipemia was successfully induced in SD rats by high-lipid diet. Different doses of Puer tea were administered to these rats for 35 days started from the 28th day of induction. Body weights of all animals were recorded during experiment. At experimental endpoint, blood lipids levels, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), malondialchehyche (MDA) in serum were measured, as well as plasma levels of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1a (6-keto-PGF1a) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2). Aortas were collected to examine morphological changes. The comparison among fermenting and fermented Puer tea groups and model group revealed that:(1) Bodyweights were remarkably reduced in Puer tea groups;(2) Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were decreased significantly Puer tea groups;(3) Activities of SOD and GSH-PX increased significantly, however, the MDA contents decreased in Puer tea groups (the effect of fermented Puer tea was more significant than fermenting Puer tea);(4) Plasma TXB2 content decreased significantly, 6-keto-PGF1a increased in Puer tea groups. And the endothelial cells damage was reduced.(1) Puer tea can prevent high lipid diet induced hyperlipidemia, fermented Puer tea shows a stronger lipid down regulation effect than fermenting Puer tea;(2) Puer tea can protect vascular endothelial cells, and this effect may relate with increasing plasma levels of PGI2 and decreasing that of TXA2.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "Calibration of the Irradiance Responsivity of a Filter Radiometer for T Measurement at NIM\n", "abstract": " At the National Institute of Metrology of China (NIM), silicon photodiode-based narrow-band interference filter radiometers (FRs) have been designed for the radiometric determination of the thermodynamic temperature. The FR calibrations were performed on a new spectral comparator with a trap detector which was calibrated against the cryogenic radiometer at several discrete laser lines. The new spectral comparator is constructed from two grating monochromators assembled to give lower stray light and higher transmitted flux. Applying a transmittance measurement of the filter in the out-of-band region and careful control of the temperature, the irradiance responsivity of a 633\u252c\u00e1nm centered FR has been obtained over a dynamic range of nearly eight decades in the wavelength range from 450\u252c\u00e1nm to 1200\u252c\u00e1nm. The relative standard uncertainty of the responsivity is also analyzed and estimated to be less than\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "Multi-agent conflict coordination in collaborative product creative design optimization\n", "abstract": " To coordinate preference conflicts among customers and designers from different fields in the process of product collaborative creative design, the original cause of conflict was analyzed, two-tuple linguistic analysis was used to integrate agents' evaluation information with multi-granularity. Then, a multi-Agent conflict coordination model, which aiming at maximizing the satisfaction degree of agents, was constructed. Furthermore, an improved adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm was proposed to find the optimal solution to the model. In this algorithm, inertia weight was dynamically changed according to current evolution speed, diversity and iterations of the swarm, which provided the algorithm with effective dynamic adaptability.

We study the main altered mineral assemblages in the Abagogn lead-zinc deposit and ltheir reflectance spectra, and the absorptive properties of each band in the multiple spectra. Using the ASTER remote sensing data, we extract the structural, lithological and alteration information of the deposit, which are well consistent with the geological data. We make integrated analysis of information from geology, geochemical exploration and remote sensing on the GIS platform. The geochemical anomalies exhibit the character of\" surface\" and the alteration anomalies have the character of\" point\".

{"title": "Molecular cloning of a novel human testis-specific gene TDRG1\n", "abstract": " To clone a novel human testis-specific gene TDRG1. A new contig of expression sequence tags (ESTs) Hs. 180197 was identified from the testis libraries using digital differential display (DDD) to screen the novel human testis-specific gene. To validate the use of bioinformatics approaches in gene discovery, the ESTs Hs. 180197, which was predicted to be testis specific, was chosen for further study. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on different normal tissues to identify the expression of Hs. 180197 in human testis. Using bioinformatics methods and IMAGE cloning of this contig, the full-length cDNA sequence of the noval human gene was cloned. This novel gene was 1197 bp in length, located in chromosome 6p21. 1-p21. 2. The sequence of the open reading frame was 504-806 bp, as confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing in human testis. The cDNA encodes a novel protein of 100 amino acids with a theoretical molecular weight of 10 000 and isoelectric point of 6.81. The sequence shares no significant homology with any known protein in the databases. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of multiple tissues further showed that the novel gene was expressed specifically in adult human testis. Considering a possible relation of this novel gene with the function of human testis, we named this new gene TDRG1 (testis development related gene 1, GenBank accession number: DQ168992). DDD combined with laboratory validation is an efficient method for identifying new human functional genes.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Research conclusions: Combined with a special subway excavation project, this paper analyzes the guard pile stiffness as support system, support stiffness and embedded depth of guard pile for foundation pit with single-factor analysis based on the simulation analysis. It concludes:(1) The deformation of exterior-protected construction can be reduced and the stability of foundation pit can be enhanced through improving the guard pile stiffness and support stiffness. However, if the stiffness is too much, the axial force becomes big, resulting in the support unstable and damaged and increase of the construction cost.(2) The depth of guard pile should be controlled in the range from 1.2 h to 1.4 h. If the embedded depth is less, the deformation of the pile becomes large, resulting in the foundation pit damage. If the embedded depth is too much, the effect on deformation control is not obvious, resulting in increase of the construction cost.(3) After Optimization of the pile diameter, the deformation control can meet the requirement of ground subsidence and the construction cost can be lowered much under the effect of guard pile with diameter of\u03b5\u20a7\u00ea 800.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The results showed that under the condition of super high yield, the above-ground biomass and the grain yield did not reduce significantly after cutting 1/4 and 1/2 of the leaf. The nitrogen accumulation of maize plants increased after leaf-cutting. The treatments of cutting 1/4 or 1/2 leaf could improve the nitrogen harvest index; with the increase of leaf cutting, the nitrogen harvest index showed the increase trend. So breeding the maize variety with smaller leaf area was an effective way to solve the low nitrogen utilization under the condition of super high yield.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The results show that the pure perovskite KBT powders can be obtained by all three methods; however, the formation mechanism and morphology evolution of powders prepared by various processes are quite different. It was deduced that the solid diffusion mechanism was applied to sol-gel process. Due to the high-temperature treatment above 700 C, the KBT powders produced by sol-gel method had large size with serious agglomeration. The cubically shaped nanopowders were prepared by hydrothermal method, which belongs to dissolution-crystallization mechanism.

To delinate the genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1 and the association of subtypes with risk factors and location of residence in Taiwan, subtypes of HIV-1 in Taiwanese patients were identified and a phylogenetic study was performed. In addition, the accuracy of peptide-enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using serum samples from Taiwanese patients infected with HIV-1 was investigated. Peptide-EIA was used to give a preliminary subtype of HIV-1-positive serum samples collected from different areas of Taiwan. Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genetic sequencing were used to confirm the peptide-EIA results and to construct a phylogenetic tree. Among the 149 serum samples, 98 were subtype B (66%), 38 subtype E (25%), two subtype Thai-B (1.3%), one subtype G (0.7%), and one subtype C (0.7%). Comparison of risk factors for HIV-1 infection and subtype revealed that most B subtype infections (59/98) occurred in homosexual or heterosexual patients, whereas 28 of 38 E subtype infections occurred in heterosexual patients. The B/E ratio was significantly different (p< 0.05) in Taipei than in other areas of Taiwan. These results suggest that the predominant subtype of HIV-1 infection in Taiwan is B, followed by E, and that the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in Taiwan is similar to that of Thailand, although the genetic sequences are distinct.

Increasing number of studies have demonstrated the protective effect of polydatin on renal ischemia reperfusion injury. However, the possible mechanisms of this protection are not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of polydatin on ischemia-reperfusion induced expression of toll-like receptor4 (TLR4) in rat renal tubular epithelia cells (NRK-52E), and analyze the mechanism of polydatin on TLR4 signal pathway. The cultured NRK-52E cells were incubated in three gas incubators for a period of 6 h at hypoxia and 24h at reoxygenation to simulate the ischemia-reperfusion injury in vitro. TLR4 mRNA level was analyzed by real-time-PCR, and the protein expression of TLR4 and NF-\u256c\u2551B by Western blotting, while TNF-\u256c\u2592 and IL-1\u256c\u2593 proteins expressions were detected by ELISA. Polydatin downregulated I/R induced mRNA and protein expressions of TLR4, and decreased the protein expression of NF-\u256c\u2551B, TNF-\u256c\u2592 and IL-1\u256c\u2593. The TLR4 blocker partially antagonized the effect of I/R on NF-\u256c\u2551B signaling, and such inhibitory effect was markedly enhanced by polydatin. In the present study, polydatin protects NRK-52E cells from I/R injury possibly by relieving the inflammatory response through regulation of TLR4/NF-\u256c\u2551B signaling pathway.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

METHOD: Three-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided into the model group, the rosiglitazone (10 mg kg-1. d-1) group, and high (400 mg. kg-1 d-1), medium (200 mg. kg-1 d-1) and low (100 mg kg-1 d-1) dosecurcumin groups. Non-transgenic mice of the same age and background were selected as the control group (n= 12). After all of the six groups were intragastrically administered for consecutively three months, the protein expressions of AKT and p-AKT in hippocampus CA1 area were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULT: The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of AKT and p-AKT positive cells in hippocampus CA1 area significantly decreased in the model group (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 01). Compared with the model group, AKT and p-AKT positive cells of hippocampus CA1 area increased obviously in the rosiglitazone group and high and medium dose curcumin group (P< 0.05 or P< 0.01), especially the medium dose group (P< 0.01). The results of Western blot were consistent with that of immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: Curcumin can recover the decreased AKT and p-AKT cells in hippocampus CAl area of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice of the AD model, suggesting that curcumin may regulate AKT and its phosphorylation process, as well as PI3K/AKT insulin signal transduction pathway, and show the anti-AD effect.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Numerical simulation of gear meshing was performed via application of explicit dynamic software LS\u03b5\u00c7\u00e6 DYNA. Dynamic meshing characteristics caused by gear meshing such as dynamic contact force and dynamic transmission error (DTE) were obtained, and the effect of modification coefficient on dynamic meshing characteristics was studied. Static transmission error (STE) was compared with the aforementioned DTE. Finally the reasons for the difference between the DTE and STE were discussed. The results shown that under different modification coefficients, the meshing frequency is always the main frequency component. Other frequency components are affected by modification coefficient, and amplitude of the frequency component close to natural frequency is relatively larger. The STE is much different from the DTE on both time and frequency domains.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "An experimental study on the effect of inter-particle friction on shear behavior of granular materials\n", "abstract": " This paper describes an investigation into the effect of inter-particle friction on shear behavior of granular materials, by performing a series of direct shear tests on an analogous soil-glass bead. In this test study, four types of inter-particle friction conditions are concerned, including dry state, water-lubricated state, flooded state and oil-lubricated state. An analysis of the test results reveals that oil lubrication is able to significantly decrease dilatancy and shear strength of granular specimens, whereas the means of water lubrication and complete submergence in water do not exert a notable effect. Based on test results, a stress-dilatancy equation is proposed that is able to properly take into account the effect of inter-particle friction on the dilatancy of granular materials. The effect of inter-particle sliding friction angle on critical state friction angle is preliminarily examined from a perspective of microscopic particle motions\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Secondly, the ROA algorithm is applied to detect edges. Furthermore, a fast version was proposed reducing the computation greatly. The optimal polarization is adaptive to window location and edge templates. Therefore the new method is robust. The utilization of optimal polarisation helps reduce the missing rate, enhance the continuity of detected edges, and decrease the false edge rate.

{"title": "Permeability of CO sub (2) and He in Yangquan coal matrix-plug saturated by CH sub (4)\n", "abstract": " The CO sub (2) permeability of Yangquan coal matrix-plug( iota 6 x 13 mm) saturated by CH sub (4) was studied by carrying out CO sub (2) breakthrough tests at 40 degree C. The similar tests were performed with inert gas He for comparison. The breakthrough tests were performed in a self-confining flow cell equipped with an online thermal conductivity detector for continually monitoring the signal of CO sub (2) or He. The imbibition of gas by coal and the influence of the pore gas pressure were investigated. It shows that unlike He there is significant residual CO sub (2) left in the coal matrix even after CO sub (2) was flushed by CH sub (4) for 36 h. It reveals that coal has stronger imbibition ability for CO sub (2), which leads to the difference in its breakthrough time for different CH sub (4) flushing time. No notable residual He is found during the breakthrough tests. He permeability is significantly higher than that of CO\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "Single channel blind separation algorithm based on singular value decomposition of wavelet components\n", "abstract": " Aiming at the problem of prior information deficiency in single channel blind separation field, a novel method based on wavelet transformation, singular value decomposition (SVD) and independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed. Firstly the wavelet decomposition and reconstruction is applied on the single channel mixed signal and a set of detail signals which represents the feature of source signals are obtained. Then SVD is adopted on this set of signals and values, which is less than threshold, is rejected. Therefore, the influence of interference wave and noise can be removed. After that, this set of disposed detail signals is viewed as input signals of ICA algorithm, and the source signals can be successfully recovered. The validation of the proposed method is performed with extensive experiments on toy and real-life datasets respectively. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm does not require any prior infor-mation and has strong robustness. Meanwhile, it can reach favorable separation performance in a fast speed.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Genomic comparative analysis among Enterococcus and non-Entercoccus strains was conducted to screen the specific targets for enterococci, and 42 target fragments were selected for the design of 50 primer pairs. Their specificity and sensitivity were then evaluated by regular PCR and real-time PCR, respectively. Finally, the method was effectively evaluated while it was used in the detection of food samples. Analysis results showed that primer EF1902 was confirmed as the best primer due to its high specificity and sensitivity in real-time PCR tests. The results showed a specific amplification from 44 Enterococcus strains, whereas no amplification from 23 non-Enterococcus strains. A detection limit of 13.78 copies/PCR for purified genomic DNA and 38.4 cfu/PCR for bacterial cultures could be achieved after PCR parameter optimization. Artificial contamination assays showed that Enterococcus could be detected by real-time PCR after 6 h enrichment, with an initial spike of 2.63 cfu/mL bacterium in milk samples. The real-time PCR method developed in this study was also applied to detect various food samples, and the positive rate of detection was 57.69%. The accuracy was 94.23% compared with the conventional standard method, which demonstrates its potential for practical application.

DML (Determined Maximum Likelihood) is a kind of algorithm for parameter estimation of determined narrowband signals, which theoretically has advantages of high precise as well as high suppression to strong noise and coherent signals. However, there are problems of high computation complexity and local convergence. Therefore, the algorithm named FPSO-DML (Fission Particle Swarm Optimization-DML) is put forward in this paper, which could get accurately global optimum root of DML function at a cost of low computation. Then, the wideband signal is decomposed into narrowband signal at different frequency by FFB, which is used to estimate 1-DOA by FPSO-DML algorithm.

On the one hand, look-ahead schemes have been integrated in many computer numerical control (CNC) systems to alleviate the frequent start/stop motion and achieve a higher feedrate. However, the unsmooth speed at the segment junctions cannot be avoided entirely due to the discontinuous nature of the linearized-segmented contour. On the other hand, parametric interpolator has been proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the linear/circular interpolator. But, it is difficult to fit the blocks into parametric curves on-line.

However, these techniques may distort the high frequency harmonics of speech, which are important to the language understanding. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach. It works by using a comb filter in time domain after Wiener filtering. With the harmonics of voiced speech enhanced and most of the noise suppressed, another comb filter in frequency domain is used to recalculate the suppression gain function, renewing the high frequency harmonics that have been compressed.

{"title": "Interface slip and the buildup of hydrodynamic pressure in nanoscale bearings\n", "abstract": " A new type of hydrodynamic bearing is presented. Instead of physically forming a wedged space by two plates, the bearing consists of two parallel plates, with regions of different wettability on one of the surfaces. With the introduction of such a wettability-patterned surface, the hydrodynamic pressure can be built up because the local slip length over different regions in the bearing is different and results in similar velocity profiles to that in a traditional wedged bearing. Molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that the hydrodynamic pressure is proportional to the shear velocity. However, as the shear velocity exceeds a critical value, the slip length becomes infinite and the hydrodynamic bearing loses its function.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The runtime solutions will enable scalable and robust realizations of scientific and engineering simulations that will achieve unprecedented scales and resolutions and will provide important insights into complex phenomena, enabling revolutionary advances in science and engineering. Our approach to implement this framework is based on a collection of autonomous modules (eg, agents, managers) that provide four basic services (self-management, self-optimizing, self-protecting and self-healing) that are essential to achieve the required autonomic operations. In this paper, we will describe the overall architecture of the autonomic runtime system and show how this system can self-optimize the computations of a large scale fire propagation simulations.

RESULTS: It was found that the frequencies of G allele in the patients with PD and controls were 0.613 and 0.527 respectively, P= 0.039\" the frequencies of TT genotype were 0.303 and 0.415 (P= 0.014), and the frequencies of GG genotype were 0.564 and 0.451 respectively (P= 0.021). When the patients were divided into two groups by age-onset, significant difference in the allelic and genotypic frequencies was observed only between early-onset PD group and control group. And when the PD patients were grouped by sex, significant difference was observed only between male PD group and male control group (the frequencies of G allele being 0.669 and 0.500 respectively, P= 0.005). CONCLUSION: This study revealed significant differences between PD group and control group in allelic and genotypic frequencies. The findings supported the hypothesis about an association between MAO-A gene and PD, suggesting that age at onset of PD and gender predisposition might be related to the putative association, and Fnu4HI SNP be a risk factor for PD.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

This paper offers the design of the crystal growth rate model according to two approaches. The first way is classical and consists of determining the parameters of the empirical expressions of the growth rate through the use of a nonlinear programming (NLP) optimization technique. The second is a novel modeling strategy that combines an artificial neural network (ANN) as an approximator of the growth rate with prior knowledge represented by the mass balance of sucrose crystal. The results shows that the first type of model performs local fitting while the second offers a greater flexibility.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Fr scales linearly with the exchange interaction and applied magnetic field H in a wide range. However, the Fr magnitude approaches saturation and then decreases as the exchange interaction continues to increase. The distinction between the spontaneous Fr and H-induced Fr is explained. The interesting difference between the dependency of Fr in 3d metals on the spin-orbit (SO) coupling strength and the similar dependency in rare earth (RE) compounds is studied.

METHODS: The data of 1 297 Chinese trauma patients were studied for trauma scoring with the Revised Trauma Score-Injury Severity Score-TRISS (RTS-ISS-TRISS) system to get a serial of new weight coefficients through analyzing a multivariation logical regression between the outcome and the injury severity. RESULTS: ISS was higher but the Age Score and probability of survival (Ps) of the death group were lower than those of the survival group. New values of RTS-ISS-Age coefficients differed from the Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS) ones, through which the constant b (0) decreased its negative value, and ISS weight b (2) increased its negative value, but RTS weight b (1) and age weight b (3) changed with the trauma types. MTOS's values and new values of weight coefficients were used on 1297 patients for prognosis by calculating Ps. The accuracy of new values (90.13%) was a little higher than that of MTOS's (89.5%), with a promotion in specialization but a loss in sensitivity.

This paper presents an investigation into the physical meaning of the equivalent skeleton void ratio by conducting a series of discrete element method (DEM) simulations on biaxial tests of assemblies of coarse and fine particles. The simulation results reveal that the parameter b is a state variable dependent on confining pressure, packing density and particle gradation and it varies during shearing. It should not be treated as a constant as reported in the literature.

In order to study the characteristics of mercury exchange flux between soil (snow) and atmosphere under the snow retention and snow melting control, sampling sites were selected in equal distances along the slope which is situated in the typical hill-valley terrain unit. Mercury exchange flux between soil (snow) and atmosphere was determined with the method of dynamic flux chamber and in all sampling sites the atmosphere concentration from 0 to 150 cm near to the earth in the vertical direction was measured. Furthermore, the impact factors including synchronous meteorology, the surface characteristics under the snow retention and snow melting control and the mercury concentration in vertical direction were also investigated. The results are as follows: During the period of snow retention and melting the air mercury tends to gather towards valley bottom along the slope and an obvious deposit tendency process was found from air to the earth's surface under the control of thermal inversion due to the underlying surface of cold source (snow surface). However, during the period of snow melting, mercury exchange flux between the soil and atmosphere on the surface of the earth with the snow being melted demonstrates alternative deposit and release processes. As for the earth with snow covered, the deposit level of mercury exchange flux between soil and atmosphere is lower than that\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

However, single channel model and color noise are common in real life application. So it is of great importance to research single channel source number estimation algorithm under colored Gaussian noise. In view of limitation of algorithm existed, a novel single channel source number estimation algorithm based on construction of time snapshots and fourth-order cumulant matrix is presented. Firstly, time snapshots theory is applied to increase signal dimensions of single channel received signal and vectorization spaces are obtained. Then these sets of spaces are adopted to construct fourth-order cumulant matrix. It is validated theoretically that the proposed fourth-order cumulant matrix can effectively restrain white and colored Gaussian noise. Finally, singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied on this matrix and source number can be estimated by information theoretic criteria. Simulation and real-life experiment results both indicate that the proposed algorithm can be applied to single channel source number estimation and has well performance to restrain colored Gaussian noise.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Wavelet transformation combined neural network based on genetic algorithm for runoff prediction\n", "abstract": " In order to obtain more accurate forecasting results of runoff, using the dmey wavelet transform, the runoff time sequence is decomposed into high frequency part and low frequency part, then using the back propagation neural network based on the genetic algorithm (GANN), both of the two subparts are predicted respectively, finally, using the inverse dmey wavelet transform, both of the two predicted results are reconstructed to form the future behavior of the runoff series. The method has been compared with three individual forecasting models, such as GANN, back propagation neural network (BPNN) and simple moving average (SMA). It is demonstrated that the presented method is superior to the other models presented in this research in terms of the same evaluation measurements. Therefore the nonlinear ensemble model proposed in this paper can reflect the runoff time series trend well, and have good forecasting stability and accuracy, and can be used as an alternative forecasting tool for rain-runoff.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

After making data extraction and quality assessment, we use RevMan 5.1 software for Meta-analysis and GRADEpro 3.6 system for classifying the quality of evidence and grade of recommendation. Results There are ten studies included in the Meta-analysis. The results shows that, compared to patients with non-drug-resistant tuberculosis, those of initial drug resistance have a sputum negative conversion rate of 91% at the end of 6 months, lung cavity closure rate of 70%, and a 2-year bacterial recurrence rate of 4.98 times.

{"title": "Experiment and research of energy depositing rate of exploding wires under different initial capacitor voltages for thin film production\n", "abstract": " Thin film produced by exploding wires is affected by many factors; one of such factors is the energy depositing rate. The research in this paper focused on measuring the voltage and current of an exploding copper wire that was 15 cm long and 0.3 mm in diameter. The time-dependent wire resistance and the energy deposited into the wire were deduced from the measured voltage and current, and the maximum wire resistance was observed at the time when part of the wire mass was heated up to the boiling point, which was called critical time and critical point, respectively. From the experiment, the following statements could be surmised: The maximum wire resistance increases from about 224.4 to 266.1 m\u256c\u2310, and the critical time reduces from about 8.8 to 7.2 \u256c\u255ds when the initial capacitor voltage changes from 10 to 20 kV, as well as the fact that the mean energy depositing rate varies from about 13.3 to 27.6 J/\u256c\u255ds\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Also, the conjugate gradient algorithm is applied to computing the weight values and threshold values with given samples in order to obtain the network of predicting ultimate bearing capacity. At last, the engineering examples are used to verify the established model. It could be concluded that it is feasible to predicting the ultimate bearing capacity of statically-pressured pipe pile with this model, which has a better prediction accuracy and applicability.

{"title": "On High-Accuracy Rotation Compensation Algorithm of Carouseling Platform Inertial Navigation System [J]\n", "abstract": " To improve navigation accuracy of HRG-based Gimbaled Inertial Navigation System (GINS), a Carouseling GINS is constructed by using a rotation mean technique. To solve the problem of severe influence of rotation effect on the final computational navigation accuracy, a high-accuracy compensation algorithm is proposed to compensate velocity and position rotation effect errors for Carouseling Platform INS. With careful analysis of Carouseling Platform INS, a complete rotating vector expression of transformation matrix is substituted into velocity and position updating equations to gain a complete velocity and position rotation error compensation formula; to avoid the time-consuming and difficult direct calculation of integration, the acceleration component of vehicle in platform coordinates is fitted using a cosine function, and then a simplified but high-accuracy compensation calculation is achieved. Simulation and experiments prove that the proposed algorithm could function better in compensating rotation effect errors and hence higher navigation accuracy was promised.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

Thus, facility location strategy in network should concern the operational cost in peacetime and emergency. This article focuses on how to locate P facilities so as to minimize expected cost including the regular operational cost as well as the emergent operational cost of a worst-case attack with the interdiction of R facilities. We have cast this problem as a bi-level binary programming model where the top level problem involves the decisions about where to locate facilities and the lower level problem entails the interdictor response on which facilities to attack. We solve the bi-level problem through hybrid genetic algorithm based on lagrange relax method. Results of this problem and traditional P-median location problem applied to European 150 data set are presented. Several solutions derived from these models are presented in greater detail and demonstrate the degree to which the loss of R facilities affects network system efficiencies with different location strategy decided by these models.

In this paper, the crystalline phase solute and dissolved phase solute are both taken into account. By the combination of the dissolution deposition mechanism with the reconstructive convection-dispersion equation, the new dynamic simulation model on solution transport and accumulation in variably saturated groundwater flow has been established. The new dynamic model is used to simulate crystalline phase solute accumulation in soils. It is shown from mass balance analysis and comparison analysis that the calculated results are correct and reasonable.

{"title": "Evaluating the uncertainty of Darcy velocity with sparse grid collocation method\n", "abstract": " Spatial variability of Darcy velocity is presented due to the heterogeneity of aquifer parameters. The uncertainty qualification of velocity suffers great challenge in the complex porous media. This work focuses on the use of sparse grid collocation method in velocity simulation. Since the sparse grid collocation method provides a non-intrusive way to incorporate any existing deterministic solver, the mixed finite element method is combined as the deterministic solver to retain the local continuity of Darcy velocity. We decompose the error of the velocity into three components, and illustrate that the Karhunen-Loeve truncation brings more error into velocity approximation than into head. The convergence properties of velocity moments restrict the application of sparse grid collocation method in the problems with small correlation lengths.

By applying the Cloude H-alpha decomposition to the original L-band image, we segment the image to 9 classes. While take this as the initial input, Wishart classification is followed. The most valuable in this paper is the section of application analysis. We found H-alpha classification has lower classification accuracy than Wishart iteration which use coherence matrix, but why? By analyzing the classification results for each type of land cover, this paper concluded the reason is that parameters of entry and alpha angle lose the original polarimetric information. While coherence matrix does not lose the original polarimetric information, we suggest that directly use coherence matrixes could derive\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The final methodology involves an extraction step in which the sample was extracted with ultrasonic and ion-exchange resin (Dowex 50\u251c\u00f9 8, Dowex 50\u251c\u00f9 2). An HPLC method using an ODS-C18 column and UV detection for the determination of glycinebetaine in plant tissue extracts was described. The mobile phase was kept constant at pH 4.5 and 50 mmol/L KH2PO4 in water, and eluted compounds are detected by UV absorbance (200 nm). The flow rate was maintained at 0.7 mL/min. This assay was very accurate with a lower detection limit of 0.02 \u256c\u255dg/mL. Recovery assays done with standard glycinebetaine and wild Kalidium foliatum resulted in a consistent recovery of 97.2%. Glycinebetaine content was quantified in K. foliatum and H. caspica cultured with different concentration of NaCl chronically and the analysis according to their current from 0 to 500 mmol/L NaCl was also discussed in this paper.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

METHODS: FISH was used to detect the frequently occurring chromosome abnormalities (-5/5q,+ 8,-7/7q-) in 37 MDS cases. SPSS 11.5 software and correlation analysis were used to analyze the relativity among the abnormal chromosomes, the prognosis and the disease conversion in 37 MDS patients. RESULTS: Karyotype abnormalities were found in 21 (56.8%) of 37 cases, among which 6 (16.2%) were complex karyotypes, 9 (24.3%)+ 8, 2 (5.4%)-5/5q-, 2 (5.4%)-7/7q-. In the median time of follow-up of 12 months, 12 cases transformed into acute leukemia. Complex karyotypes were significantly associated with the poor prognosis and leukemia transformation.+ 8 and-7/7q-abnormalities were correlated with the death. CONCLUSIONS: FISH was more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics for detecting mini-clonal abnormality. There are some differences in abnormal karyotypes between patients in China and the western countries. Multi-probes used in cytogenetic detections may predict the patient's prognosis more accurately. The higher proportion of abnormal karyotypes the poorer prognosis.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Consistency assurance in flattening hierarchical architectural models.\n", "abstract": " Composite components are components that have internal structures. Supported by almost all architecture description languages, composite components can organize architectural models in a hierarchical structure. However, most analysis and verification tools for SA model do not support composite components, neither do most component frameworks. Therefore, it is necessary to flatten the hierarchical SA model sothat SA can play a more important role in practice. The most challenging issue in the flattening is how to assure the consistency between architectural models with and without composite components. In this paper, a formal definition of the consistency of an SA model is presented. Based on that, principles and guidelines for consistency assurance in flattening a hierarchical SA model are provided.

The distance between layers of montmorillonite in nanocomposite is bigger than that of nanocomposite prepared by emulsion polymerization using anion emulsifier, which demonstrate that the cationic surfactant CTAB acts as the emulsifier and also as an intercalated agent, facilitating the intercalation of polystyrene chains. The DSC curves indicate that the glass transition temperature of the nanocomposites is enhanced in some degree.

METHODS: For all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the\" infected\" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time CSF was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to antibiotics. After the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. As soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. By the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. RESULTS: Among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative Staphylococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with Streptococci, and another one with Mycobacterium stercoris bovis. The tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. There were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. Practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of streptococcal infection. The duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days.

Extra-cellular protease, gelatinase, lipase as well as haemolysis tests were performed on them. Lysophospholipase (Tlh)-targeted PCR was also carried out in order to reveal if the haemolysis caused by bacterial strains were related to Tlh. Results showed that 35 out of 105 strains possessed extra-cellular enzymatic abilities and strains 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 and 16 were the most powerful ones of all. Among these 35 strains, 85.6% strains (30/35) possessed haemolytic activities on goat blood agar and specific PCR revealed that 16 strains were PCR positive, indicating that they contained Tlh genes. In order to identify these strains, API 20 E strips were employed and results indicated that 50% were vibrios, among them Vibrio alginolyticus composed 70% of the vibrio population. In conclusion, compared to other strains, 6 Vibrio alginolyticus (strain 1, 2, 3, 5, 13, and 16) and 2 Vibrio parahaemolyticus (strain 9 and 21) which all were isolated from whitened abalone postlarvae, warrant further studies due to their better abilities in extra-cellular enzyme (s) production and/or haemolytic activities.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The apoA-\u0393\u00e0\u00e1 mediated cellular cholesterol efflux was enhanced by thiol protease inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Thiol protease inhibitors might provide an alternative way to upregulate ABCA1 protein. This strategy is especially appealing since it may mimic the stabilizing effect of the natural ligands apoA-\u0393\u00e0\u00e1.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The etiology, diagnosis and management are hereby introduced and discussed. METHODS: The diagnosis was based on history, audiological examinations, high resolution CT scanning and/or the operation. The modified Lempert's fenestration operation of the horizontal semicircular canal was performed on one ear each of the elder brother and the younger sister. RESULTS: Postoperative hearing threshold was 25 dB for speech frequencies with a gain of 47dB for the elder brother, and hearing threshold of 28 dB with a gain of 52 dB for the younger sister. Following up one to eight years individually showed that their hearing gains were steady. CONCLUSION: Patients' parents are relatives of first cousin and have two sons and one daughter. However, there are two family members suffered from bilateral congenital absence of stapes and oval window, and these malformations might be related to inheritance. Good bone conduction and Carhart's notches revealed bilaterally in the patients' audiograms. These are the important indications for diagnosis of this disease.

Methods The incidence ofcardiovascular disease was monitored according to MONICA procedure among 100 000 residents in each of 13populations from different parts of China in 1991-1995. A random cluster sample of 1000 (35-59 years, men andwomen) was drawn from each population for survey of CHD risk factors with a 1/10 sub-samples for 3 consecutivedays 24-hour dietary interviews (dietary data was available for 13 populations). Results The age-standardized (25-74years) incidence of CHD was 1-154/100 000 for men and 0-75/100 000 for women among 13 populations. Only the mean daily intake of carotene (421-1416/1000 K cal, 573-2114/1000 Kcal for men andwomen) was significantly inversely correlated with the incidence of CHD (r=-0.423 1, P= 0.03) by simplecorrelation analysis. The major sources of carotene were deep colored vegetables, which provided 38-91% ofcarotene ne among populations. The resultS of mulhple linear~ ion showed that~ daily intake Of caIDtene andthe intake ratio of deep colored vegetables to total vegetables were significantly negatively associated with theincidence of CHD (b=-0.038 9, \u256c\u2593=-0.355 6, P= 0.01, R2= 0.80; b=-55.501 4,=-0.273 4, P= 0.03, R2= 0.88, respectively) after adjustment for gender, mean BMI, serum TC and DBP.

It is found that the prior deformation of austenite retards significantly the bainitic transformation. At the same isothermal transformation temperature, as the amount of prior deformation is higher, the quantity of bainite (which can be obtained after the isothermal transformation is completed) becomes less and it is also more difficult to develop the classical sheaf-like structure.

A recent study found the IR-laser irradiation induced ethane pyrolysis yields 25% higher ethylene production rates compared to the conventional steam cracking method. Laser induced pyrolysis is initiated by the generation of radicals upon heating of the ethane, then, followed by ethane/ethylene autocatalytic reaction in which ethane is converted into ethylene and other light hydrocarbons. This procedure is governed by micro-mixing of reactants and the feedstock residence time in reactor. Under mild turbulent conditions, the turbulence enhances the micro-mixing process and allows a high yield of ethylene.

{"title": "a Modified Method for Polarimetric SAR Calibration Algorithm\n", "abstract": " Present fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems often update calibration techniques to further enhance the accuracy to the polarimetric data. In this paper, we propose a modified method to estimate the value of crosstalk based on the corrected observed value. Since Ainsworth calibration algorithm firstly set the value of k to be one. And the value of k relates to the copolarization channel imbalance. We consider the effects of value of k and analyze it. Through comparison to crosstalk results between the stimulated parameters and the estimated parameters, we assume high co-polarization channel imbalance will be obviously to affect crosstalk results. Then, used covariance observation value of the initial value of k rewrites the model to solve related parameters. And crosstalk parameter is calculated by the same iterative method. To verify the effect of the modified calibration method, this letter compares the accuracy of the two methods using the simulated polarimetric SAR data and Chinese airborne X-band polarimetric SAR data. The results confirm that the modified method tends to get more accurate crosstalk results.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Magnetic properties of sediments and their response to environmental changes during the Holocene in the Fuzhou Basin, Fujian, China\n", "abstract": " The Fuzhou basin is an ideal place for high-resolution paleoclimate study due to its special location (in the coastal zone), where sediments recorded a wealth of information on the interaction between ocean and land during the Holocene. In this paper, rock magnetism, environmental magnetism and paleomagnetism features of core FZ5 sediments in the Fuzhou basin were studied to reveal response of magnetic properties to terrigenous input, sea-level change and diagenesis. The rock magnetism results show that ferrimagnetic minerals with low coercivity are the dominant minerals, while the types of magnetic minerals vary in different stages of environmental variation. Magnetite, siderite and some amounts of Fe-sulphides are the main contributors to magnetic properties in the transgression environment during the early and middle Holocene (9 similar to 3 cal. ka BP), although sulphidation dissolved fine-grained magnetite to form greigite and pyrite. However, sulphidation did not completely eliminate the natural remanence carried by magnetite and the dominant controls of the terrestrial detritus input and sea-level fluctuations to magnetic properties in this stage. During the late Holocene (3 cal. ka BP), magnetite was still partly dissolved to greigite due to the earlier reduction in the terrestrial oxidizing environment, but further transformation was restrained by the oxidation then. Strong oxidation process formed the high coercivity minerals and disturbed the natural remanence. During the deposition process, the six strong ancient oxide interfaces were produced at similar to 8.2, similar to 7.7, similar to 7.5, similar to 2.7, similar to 1.5, similar to 0.5 cal\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The Ziegler-Natta catalyst is characterized by assuming the existence of multiple types of catalyst sites and deconvolution data from gel permeation chromatography to determine the most probable chain-length distribution and relative amounts of polymer produced at each site type. A set of suitable reaction subclasses and kinetic constants for different site types that fit plant conditions is developed, validating our model.

The periods of oxygen isotope in both Dongge Cave and Sanbao Cave were characterized by three stages during the Holocene. However, the length, as well as the intensity of oxygen isotope periods displayed significant difference between two caves. The reason is that the climate in Sanbao Cave region was only controlled by the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM), while that in Dongge Cave region was jointly influenced by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and EASM. The weak periods in Dongge Cave may be correlated to the strong anti-phasing of the ISM and EASM.

To create specimens with different initial fabrics, they applied loading paths involving preshearing to failure, either in compression or in extension; subsequently they reconsolidated the samples to the initial isotropic stress state. The fabric anisotropy formed in this way can be termed a stress-induced anisotropy. Using this approach, considerable computational time may be required to create samples with different anisotropic fabrics and to bring them to an identical target stress state and void ratio, prior to subsequent shearing. An additional point to consider is that the specimen geometry may affect the simulation results; using this approach the different specimens may have different sizes and\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

METHODS: We included in this study 43 cases of advanced prostate cancer with BOO treated by TURP, and analyzed their IPSS, maximum urinary flow rate and relevant risk factors pre-operatively and at 3 and 12 months after TURP. RESULTS: Compared with the baseline, IPSS and the maximum urinary flow rate of the patients showed significant differences 3 months after surgery ([19.60+/-0.41] score vs.[9.58+/-0.33] score,[4.93+/-0.68] ml/s vs.[8.96+/-0.47] ml/s, P< 0.05), but not at 12 months ([15.73+/-0.66] score,[5.67+/-0.44] ml/s). In multiple regression analysis, a good outcome was associated with pre-operative acute urinary retention, while poor prognosis with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: In the treatment of advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer with BOO, TURP can reduce IPSS and increase the maximum urinary flow rate in the early period after surgery, but its long-term effect is not so desirable. Meanwhile the operation itself may bring about relevant complications and reduce the patient's quality of life.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

METHODS: Twelve New Zealand rabbits with implanted VX2 tumor (24 models) were divided into lipiodol group, chemotherapeutic agent group and CALE group with intratumoral injections of the corresponding agents. The pathological changes of all the lesions were observed and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were evaluated 7 days after the operation. RESULTS: Compared with the lipiodol group and chemotherapie agent group, intratumoral injection of CALE resulted in the highest tumor necrosis rate and greatest tumor necrosis (P< 0.01). The labeling indices of PCNA and VEGF expressions in CALE group were markedly lower than those in the other two groups (P< 0.01).

The simulation results indicate that the inter-annual variation of river discharge is primarily controlled by climate change, especially the precipitation. Land-use change, one the contrary, shows relatively less contributions on the variations of river discharge the NA as a whole. However, the effects of land use change and management on river discharge show large spatial variation and long-term effects through changing ET and the patterns of seasonal soil moisture profiles.

{"title": "A speech enhancement preprocessor for robust speech recognition\n", "abstract": " To improve the robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) system in adverse environments, speech enhancement preprocessor has been widely used recently to reduce the impact of noise. In this paper, an improved noise estimation approach is proposed in the enhancement preprocessor to keep enhancement performance with low distortion and complexity. First, the noisy speech is transformed into Bark domain and the minima values are tracked. Then, these values are applied to control the smoothing factor of recursive averaging in noise estimator. Based on perceptual model, the proposed approach makes full use of correlations among frequency bins in the same Bark band to track noise better. Furthermore, this approach has low complexity and is suitable for consecutive recognition process.

METHODS: Thirty-four patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were divided into the traditional ventilation strategy plus positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) group (n= 13) and the protective ventilation strategy group (n= 21), and their diagnosis and treatment were reviewed. RESULTS: The average ventilator-carrying time in the protective ventilation strategy group and the traditional ventilation strategy plus PEEP group was (4.8+/-2.1) and (7.2+/-3.6) days, and the mortality was 23.8% and 61.5% respectively. There was statistical significance in the 2 groups (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The key to ARDS is the early diagnosis and ventilation strategy. Protective ventilation strategy in treating ARDS is more effective than the traditional ventilation strategy plus PEEP, and it can obviously shorten the ventilator-carrying time and reduce the mortality of ARDS.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

A model to explain these increases proposes that TS and DHFR proteins inhibit their own translation by binding to their respective cognate mRNA and that antifolates disrupt the RNA-protein interaction, allowing translation to resume. Our previous findings provide evidence that the adaptive upregulation of DHFR by MTX contributes to the decreased sensitivity to this drug. Therefore, we are screening novel antifolates that will not increase their target protein levels. A metastatic colon cancer cell line, C85, was treated at the IC50 concentration of each antifolate (IC50 value of each antifolate following 96 hour exposure was determined by MTS assay) for 48 hours.

{"title": "The correlations between BL Lacs and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays deflected by using different GMF models\n", "abstract": " Some studies suggested that a correlation between locations of BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) and the arrival directions of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) exists. Especially by assuming the primary particles charged +1 and using a galactic magnetic field (GMF) model to calculate the deflections of the UHECRs, the significance of correlation is improved. We construct a new GMF model by incorporating all progresses in the GMF measurements in recent years. Based on a thorough study of the deflections of the UHECRs measured by the AGASA experiment, we study the GFM model dependence of the correlation between the UHECRs and the selected BL Lacs using the new model together with others. It turns out that only specific one of those GMF models makes the correlation significant, even if neither GMF models themselves nor deflections of the UHECRs are not significantly different. It suggests that the significance of the correlation, calculated using a method suggested in those studies, is intensively depending on the GMF model. Great improvement in statistics may help to suppress the sensitivity to the GMF models.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

This study was to investigate the biologic properties of an anti-human ovarian carcinoma/anti-human CD3 single chain bispecific antibody (BHL-I) in vitro, and provide reference for pre-clinical experiment and its application. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors, were treated with BHL-I. The conjugation between PBLs and target ovarian carcinoma SKOV3 cells was observed under reverse microscope; the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and cytotoxicity of PBLs to SKOV3 cells were detected by MTT assay; the concentrations of human interferon-gamma (hIFN-gamma) and human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (hTNF-alpha), secreted by PBLs in the process of killing target cells, were detected by ELISA. The rosette (PBL-SKOV3) formation rate was significantly higher in BHL-I group than in control group (15.7% vs. 11.1%, P< 0.01). BHL-I significantly enhanced the proliferation of PBLs and cytotoxicity of PBLs to SKOV3 cells in the presence of relative antigen (P< 0.01); the cytotoxic rate was positively correlated with the rosette formation rate (r= 0.946); the concentrations of hIFN-gamma and hTNF-alpha were significantly increased (P< 0.01).

{"title": "A rule-based expert system for control rod pattern of boiling water reactors by hovering around haling exposure shape\n", "abstract": " Feasible strategies for automatic BWR control rod pattern generation have been implemented in a rule-based expert system. These strategies are majorly based on a concept for which exposure distributions are hovering around the Haling exposure distribution through a cycle while radial and axial power distributions are dominantly controlled by some abstracted factors indicating the desired distributions. The system can either automatically generate expert-level control rod patterns or search for criteria-satisfied patterns originated from user's input. It has successfully been demonstrated by generating control rod patterns for the the 1775 MWth Chinshan plant in Unit I Cycle 13 alternate loading pattern and Unit 2 Cycle 8 but with longer cycle length. All rod patterns for two cycles result in all-rod-out at EOC and no violation against the four criteria. The demonstrations show that the system is considerably good in choosing initial trial rod patterns and adjusting rod patterns to satisfy the design criteria.

The results show that the oxidation-resistance of treated uranium in moist air has not been enhanced obviously at 70 degree C, but has been improved clearly at 40 degree C. Increasing dose of CO in the experimental range gives the better results. The composition of surface layer of uranium and treated uranium have been analyzed respectively by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). The analysis indicates that there is a rich-carbon layer formed in the surface layer after uranium has been treated with CO, and this rich-carbon layer is probably important to enhance the corrosion-resistance of uranium", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Nitric oxide-mediated the cardioprotection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation\n", "abstract": " AIM: To investigate the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling in tumor necrosis factor-?(TNF-?)-induced cardioprotection against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury. METHODS: Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were pretreated with TNF-? or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or L-arginine (L-Arg), respectively, for 12 h and then subjected to continuous hypoxia for 12 h, followed by reoxygenation for 6 h. The manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) activity of the cells was measured after H/R. Myocyte injury was determined by the release of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). RESULTS: TNF-?(10~ 5 (U/L)) significantly increased the Mn-SOD activity and decreased release of LDH from ventricular myocytes. The cardioprotection against H/R injury was induced by the pretreatment with SNP (5? mol/L) or L-Arg (5 mmol/L), which was blocked by ODQ (10? mol/L), the specific sGC inhibitor, and Chel (5? mol/L), the specific PKC inhibitor. Pretreatment with L-NAME (100? mol/L), ODQ, Chel, antoxidant 2-MPG (400? mol/L) or tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50? mol/L) attenuated the increased Mn-SOD activity and reduced LDH level induced by TNF-?. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that NO may play a role in TNF-?-induced cardioprotection, which is mediated by sGC and PKC.[", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "The effect of microstructure on fracture toughness for silicon nitride ceramics\n", "abstract": " Effect of microstructure on the fracture toughness for Si 3 N 4 ceramics were studied. The Si 3 N 4 ceramics were fabricated by pressureless sintering using two kinds of Si 3 N 4 powders (high purity powder: E10, and relatively low purity powder: 9S) as starting powders. Grain growth of \u256c\u2593-silicon nitride was controlled by keeping time and sintering temperature. The fracture toughness was measured by indentation fracture (IF) method and single-edge-precracked-beam (SEPB) method. There was a discrepancy between the fracture toughness values obtained by these two methods. From this study it was found that the materials with more large elongated Si 3 N 4 grains gave higher fracture toughness, R-curve behavior and large discrepancy. This was contributed to the effects of grain bridging, pull-out and deflection by large elongated Si 3 N 4 grains. Comparing the specimens fabricated from the E10 and 9S powders, both reached high fracture toughness over 9 MPa\u252c\u2556 m 1/2 by the SEPB method.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

{"title": "Surveillance video object tracking with differential SSIM\n", "abstract": " The recently proposed use of the structural similarity measure, in the particle filter-based video tracker has been shown to improve the tracking performance, compared to similar methods using the colour or edge histograms and Bhattacharyya distance. However, the combined use of the structural similarity and a particle filter results in a computationally complex tracker that may not be suitable for some real time applications. In this paper, a novel fast approach to the use of the structural similarity in video tracking is proposed. The tracking algorithm presented in this work determines the state of the target (location, size) based on the gradient ascent procedure applied to the structural similarity surface of the video frame, thus avoiding computationally expensive sampling of the state space. The new method, while being computationally less expensive, performs better, than the standard mean shift and the structural similarity particle filter trackers, as shown in exemplary surveillance video sequences.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}

The fuels selected were hydrocarbons forming resonance stabilized radicals in flames, such as indene, cyclopentadiene (CPD) and two methylnaphthalenes. Experiments were performed in a laminar flow reactor over the temperature range of 550 \u252c\u2551C to 1000 \u252c\u2551C with 25/50 \u252c\u2551C increments. The products were analyzed using GC/MS and HPLC UV-vis. PM3, a semiempirical molecular orbital method, was employed to study the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of reactants, products and intermediates. The previous studies on CPD and indene indicated at the resonance stabilized radicals can cause continued growth of the staring materials and increased formation of soot. Two competing mechanisms have been hypothesized based on experimental observations. Computational results are mostly in agreement with experimental observations, which also provide further support of the preferential formation of selected", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}
{"title": "Robust wideband Capon Beamforming in the presence of coherent interferences\n", "abstract": " The robust Capon beamformer (RCB) is an extension of the standard Capon beamformer (SCB) in the case of uncertain steering vectors and is devised under the narrowband and incoherent signals assumption. However, in many practical applications the signal of interest (SOI) is intrinsically wideband and coherent interferences exist, as either a natural result of a multipath propagation effect, or intentional unfriendly jamming. For wideband signals, we can use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to divide the array outputs into many narrowband frequency bins and then apply the RCB to each bin separately. However, the main lobe beamwidth of the RCB decreases with frequency, which is undesirable in some applications such as power estimation in source localization. In this paper, we present an algorithm that do a trade-off between array aperture and decorrelation ability to build a wideband coherent RCB that has\u252c\u00e1\u0393\u00c7\u00aa", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["19"]}
