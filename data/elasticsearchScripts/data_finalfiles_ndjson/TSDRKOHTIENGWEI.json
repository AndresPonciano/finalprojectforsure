{"title": "Review of complexity metrics for object oriented software products\n", "abstract": " It is widely accepted that sizing or predicting the volumes of various kinds of software deliverable items is one of the first and most dominant aspects of software cost estimating. Most of the cost estimation model or techniques usually assume that software size or structural complexity is the integral factor that influences software development effort. Although sizing and complexity measure is a very critical due to the need of reliable size estimates in the utilization of existing software project cost estimation models and complex problem for software cost estimating, advances in sizing technology over the past 30 years have been impressive. This paper attempts to review the 12 object-oriented software metrics proposed in 90s\u2019 by Chidamber, Kemerer and Li.", "num_citations": "13\n", "authors": ["1233"]}
{"title": "Systematic literature review on effort estimation for Open Sources (OSS) web application development\n", "abstract": " The development of Web applications has a crucial role as most organizations have their own corporate Web applications to meet the needs of their respective businesses. Different needs create different complexities which represent a new challenge to Web application development. In order to ensure the timely delivery of a project, software providers offering this service choose to use Open Sources (OSS) as an alternative. Since OSS consist of an existing framework that can be implemented directly into the application, how far does this affect the complexity of the effort estimation? A number of research papers have outlined the efforts made to refine the complexity of this field. However, to our best knowledge a systematic overview of the research done on Web application development that involves OSS usage does not appear to exist. Hence, the aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "12\n", "authors": ["1233"]}
{"title": "ENERGY CONSUMPTION PATTERNS OF MOBILE APPLICATIONS IN ANDROID PLATFORM: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW.\n", "abstract": " Studies related to resource consumption of mobile devices and mobile applications have been brought to the fore lately as mobile applications depend largely on their resource consumption. The study aims to identify the key factors and holistic understanding of how a factor influences Consumption Pattern (CP) effectiveness for an android platform mobile application. The study presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on existing studies that examined factors influencing the effectiveness of CP for android mobile application and measured the effectiveness of CP. Therefore, the current SLR is conducted to answer the following questions:(1) What is the evidence of CP factors that drain the battery of a mobile device?(2) What are the energy conservation techniques to overcome all the factors that drain battery life? and (3) How can developers measure the effectiveness of an energy conservation technique?. The SLR investigated factors affecting the effectiveness of CP for android platform mobile application. The analyses of forty papers were used in our synthesis of the evidence related to the research questions above. Therefore, the analyses showed 22 studies that investigated how to measure the energy conservation technique effectiveness while 18 studies focused on better understanding of how the resources of mobile devices are actually spent. In this sense, 2 studies show the effectiveness of early analysis of software application design. Additionally, five factors ie, architecture, interface, behavior of the application, resources, and network technologies that affect CP effectiveness were identified.

{"title": "Impact propagation of human errors on software requirements volatility\n", "abstract": " Requirements volatility (RV) is one of the key risk sources in software development and maintenance projects because of the frequent changes made to the software. Human faults and errors are major factors contributing to requirement change in software development projects. As such, predicting requirements volatility is a challenge to risk management in the software area. Previous studies only focused on certain aspects of the human error in this area. This study specifically identifies and analyses the impact of human errors on requirements gathering and requirements volatility. It proposes a model based on responses to a survey questionnaire administered to 215 participants who have experience in software requirement gathering. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to analyse the correlation of human errors and requirement volatility. The results of the analysis confirm the correlation between human errors and RV. The results show that human actions have a higher impact on RV compared to human perception. The study provides insights into software management to understand socio-technical aspects of requirements volatility in order to control risk management. Human actions and perceptions respectively are a root cause contributing to human errors that lead to RV.", "num_citations": "4\n", "authors": ["1233"]}

{"title": "Literature review on energy consumption and conservation in mobile device\n", "abstract": " Mobile devices are increasing in number today. Consequently, computational resources are growing in tandem. Energy consumption has become a major issue all over the globe. On mobile devices (smart phones), there is a huge gap between battery power capabilities as well as innovations with other technologies (for example, developing and also memory space), this is especially the case with examining the rapid development in its consumed energy-lost mobile phone in different area (such as, multimedia streaming). Most of the insufficient power supplies and also the need for minimizing energy depletion offers the commitment for professionals to create energy consumption techniques or model for coming-generation wireless network. Based on the above, it is necessary to take the approach for energy consumption minimization and improvement of energy conservation into consideration. This could help achieve the desire of green technology for using less energy power in mobile devices. To gain this aim is it possible? Consequently, heterogeneous approach in energy consumption and conservation in mobile device which have been proposed by various researchers has been investigated in this paper. This would help to put in proper perspective the different energy consumption models directed at energy conservation.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["1233"]}
{"title": "A literature review on mobile devices touch screen inputs and its techniques evaluation\n", "abstract": " Due to the proliferation of touch screen devices, both technical and non-technical users are increasingly using these devices including the older adults. Interaction with input devices while on the go is increasing and has become a common habit of people nowadays. In fact, at times it might also be a need for different people of different age groups. Common sense leads to believe that performing tasks that require high mental workload such as text input in walking state, can prove fatal as the users visual attention gets split between the environment and the device. Situational impairment can happen because of environmental, attentional and physical factors at various times while the user is operating the device. Previous studies have measured the negative impact of mobility on text input performance of young adults, expert users on touch screen devices of different sizes.

Most availability models try to predict avalability of a software during its life cycle, but there are very few or no models that predict a software going days without a failure. Based on the data collected by John Musa of Bell Telephone Laboratories, we would predict the availability of a system going days without a failure using a decision tree model. Over the years, decision trees have been used for prediction and can be said to be a reliabe technique.
