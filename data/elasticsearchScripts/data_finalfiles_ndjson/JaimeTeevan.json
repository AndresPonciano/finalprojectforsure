{"title": "Tackling the poor assumptions of naive bayes text classifiers\n", "abstract": " Naive Bayes is often used as a baseline in text classification because it is fast and easy to implement. Its severe assumptions make such efficiency possible but also adversely affect the quality of its results. In this paper we propose simple, heuristic solutions to some of the problems with Naive Bayes classifiers, addressing both systemic issues as well as problems that arise because text is not actually generated according to a multinomial model. We find that our simple corrections result in a fast algorithm that is competitive with stateof-the-art text classification algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine.", "num_citations": "1441\n", "authors": ["2074"]}
{"title": "Personalizing search via automated analysis of interests and activities\n", "abstract": " We formulate and study search algorithms that consider a user's prior interactions with a wide variety of content to personalize that user's current Web search. Rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching, we pursue techniques that leverage implicit information about the user's interests. This information is used to re-rank Web search results within a relevance feedback framework. We explore rich models of user interests, built from both search-related information, such as previously issued queries and previously visited Web pages, and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created. Our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization, but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1158\n", "authors": ["2074"]}

Content based prediction of the spread of ideas in microblogging communities\n", "abstract": " Current social media research mainly focuses on temporal trends of the information flow and on the topology of the social graph that facilitates the propagation of information. In this paper we study the effect of the content of the idea on the information propagation. We present an efficient hybrid approach based on a linear regression for predicting the spread of an idea in a given time frame. We show that a combination of content features with temporal and topological features minimizes prediction error.", "num_citations": "544\n", "authors": ["2074"]}

{"title": "Guidelines for human-AI interaction\n", "abstract": " Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "472\n", "authors": ["2074"]}
{"title": "Systems, methods, and interfaces for providing personalized search and information access\n", "abstract": " The present invention relates to systems and methods that employ user models to personalize generalized queries and/or search results according to information that is relevant to respective user characteristics. A system is provided that facilitates generating personalized searches of information. The system includes a user model to determine characteristics of a user. The user model may be assembled automatically via an analysis of a user's content, activities, and overall context. A personalization component automatically modifies queries and/or search results in view of the user model in order to personalize information searches for the user. A user interface receives the queries and displays the search results from one or more local and/or remote search engines, wherein the interface can be adjusted in a range from more personalized searches to more generalized searches.", "num_citations": "379\n", "authors": ["2074"]}
{"title": "Information re-retrieval: Repeat queries in Yahoo's logs\n", "abstract": " People often repeat Web searches, both to find new information on topics they have previously explored and to re-find information they have seen in the past. The query associated with a repeat search may differ from the initial query but can nonetheless lead to clicks on the same results. This paper explores repeat search behavior through the analysis of a one-year Web query log of 114 anonymous users and a separate controlled survey of an additional 119 volunteers. Our study demonstrates that as many as 40% of all queries are re-finding queries. Re-finding appears to be an important behavior for search engines to explicitly support, and we explore how this can be done. We demonstrate that changes to search engine results can hinder re-finding, and provide a way to automatically detect repeat searches and predict repeat clicks.", "num_citations": "375\n", "authors": ["2074"]}

Previous research suggests that domain experts employ different search strategies and are more successful in finding what they are looking for than non-experts. In this paper we present a large-scale, longitudinal, log-based analysis of the effect of domain expertise on web search behavior in four different domains (medicine, finance, law, and computer science). We characterize the nature of the queries, search sessions, web sites visited, and search success for users identified as experts and non-experts within these domains. Large-scale analysis of real-world interactions allows us to understand how expertise relates to vocabulary, resource use, and search task under more realistic search conditions than has been possible in previous small-scale studies.

{"title": "To personalize or not to personalize: modeling queries with variation in user intent\n", "abstract": " In most previous work on personalized search algorithms, the results for all queries are personalized in the same manner. However, as we show in this paper, there is a lot of variation across queries in the benefits that can be achieved through personalization. For some queries, everyone who issues the query is looking for the same thing. For other queries, different people want very different results even though they express their need in the same way. We examine variability in user intent using both explicit relevance judgments and large-scale log analysis of user behavior patterns. While variation in user behavior is correlated with variation in explicit relevance judgments the same query, there are many other factors, such as result entropy, result quality, and task that can also affect the variation in behavior. We characterize queries using a variety of features of the query, the results returned for the query, and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "331\n", "authors": ["2074"]}
{"title": "Relating web page change with revisitation patterns\n", "abstract": " Web page change may be related to revisitation patterns to support web interaction. In an example embodiment, a method involves analyzing change and revisitation data for a web page, determining a relationship between the data, inferring consumption intent by a user for the web page, and utilizing the inferred consumption intent. More specifically, change data is analyzed to produce a change characterization, with the change data reflecting differences between content of a web page at different times. Revisitation data is analyzed to produce a revisitation characterization, with the revisitation data including visit times to the web page by a user. A relationship is determined between the change and the revisitation data based on the change and the revisitation characterizations. Consumption intent of the user for the content of the web page is inferred responsive to the relationship. The inferred consumption intent\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "271\n", "authors": ["2074"]}
{"title": "Large scale analysis of web revisitation patterns\n", "abstract": " Our work examines Web revisitation patterns. Everybody revisits Web pages, but their reasons for doing so can differ depending on the particular Web page, their topic of interest, and their intent. To characterize how people revisit Web content, we analyzed five weeks of Web interaction logs of over 612,000 users. We supplemented these findings by a survey intended to identify the intent behind the observed revisitation. Our analysis reveals four primary revisitation patterns, each with unique behavioral, content, and structural characteristics. Through our analysis we illustrate how understanding revisitation patterns can enable Web sites to provide improved navigation, Web browsers to predict users' destinations, and search engines to better support fast, fresh, and effective finding and re-finding.", "num_citations": "238\n", "authors": ["2074"]}

This paper explores changes in Web content by analyzing a crawl of 55,000 Web pages, selected to represent different user visitation patterns. Although change over long intervals has been explored on random (and potentially unvisited) samples of Web pages, little is known about the nature of finer grained changes to pages that are actively consumed by users, such as those in our sample. We describe algorithms, analyses, and models for characterizing changes in Web content, focusing on both time (by using hourly and sub-hourly crawls) and structure (by looking at page-, DOM-, and term-level changes). Change rates are higher in our behavior-based sample than found in previous work on randomly sampled pages, with a large portion of pages changing more than hourly.

{"title": "Potential for personalization\n", "abstract": " Current Web search tools do a good job of retrieving documents that satisfy the most common intentions associated with a query, but do not do a very good job of discerning different individuals' unique search goals. We explore the variation in what different people consider relevant to the same query by mining three data sources: (1) explicit relevance judgments, (2) clicks on search results (a behavior-based implicit measure of relevance), and (3) the similarity of desktop content to search results (a content-based implicit measure of relevance). We find that people's explicit judgments for the same queries differ greatly. As a result, there is a large gap between how well search engines could perform if they were to tailor results to the individual, and how well they currently perform by returning results designed to satisfy everyone. We call this gap the potential for personalization. The two implicit indicators we studied\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "188\n", "authors": ["2074"]}
{"title": "Discovery is never by chance: designing for (un) serendipity\n", "abstract": " Serendipity has a long tradition in the history of science as having played a key role in many significant discoveries. Computer scientists, valuing the role of serendipity in discovery, have attempted to design systems that encourage serendipity. However, that research has focused primarily on only one aspect of serendipity: that of chance encounters. In reality, for serendipity to be valuable chance encounters must be synthesized into insight. In this paper we show, through a formal consideration of serendipity and analysis of how various systems have seized on attributes of interpreting serendipity, that there is a richer space for design to support serendipitous creativity, innovation and discovery than has been tapped to date. We discuss how ideas might be encoded to be shared or discovered by'association-hunting'agents.
