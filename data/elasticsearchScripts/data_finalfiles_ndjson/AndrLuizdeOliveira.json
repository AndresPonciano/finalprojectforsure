{"title": "DNA extraction from hair shafts of wild Brazilian felids and canids\n", "abstract": " Wild felids and canids are usually the main predators in the food chains where they dwell and are almost invisible to behavior and ecology researchers. Due to their grooming behavior, they tend to swallow shed hair, which shows up in the feces. DNA found in hair shafts can be used in molecular studies that can unravel, for instance, genetic variability, reproductive mode and family structure, and in some species, it is even possible to estimate migration and dispersion rates in given populations. First, however, DNA must be extracted from hair. We extracted successfully and dependably hair shaft DNA from eight wild Brazilian felids, ocelot, margay, oncilla, Geoffroy's cat, pampas cat, jaguarundi, puma, and jaguar, as well as the domestic cat and from three wild Brazilian canids, maned wolf, crab-eating fox, and hoary fox, as well as the domestic dog. Hair samples came mostly from feces collected at the S\u00e3o Paulo Zoo and were also gathered from non-sedated pet or from recently dead wild animals and were also collected from museum specimens. Fractions of hair samples were stained before DNA extraction, while most samples were not. Our extraction protocol is based on a feather DNA extraction technique, based in the phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol general method, with proteinase K as digestive enzyme.", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["2205"]}
{"title": "Schistosome/mollusk: genetic compatibility\n", "abstract": " Schistosomiasis remains one of the most prevalent parasitic infections and has significant economic and public health consequences in many developing countries. Economic development and improvement in standard of living in these countries are dependent on the elimination of this odious disease. For the control of Schistosomiasis, understanding the host/parasite association is important, since the host parasite relationship is often complex and since questions remain concerning the susceptibility of snails to infection by respective trematodes and their specificity and suitability as hosts for continued parasite development. Thus, the long term aim of this research is to learn more about the genetic basis of the snail/parasite relationship with the hope of finding novel ways to disrupt the transmission of this disease. In the current research, genetic variability among susceptible and resistant strains within and between Biomphalaria glabrata and B. tenagophila was investigated using RAPD-PCR. The results indicate great genetic variations within the two snail species using three different primers (intrapopulational variations), while specimens from the same snail species showed few individual differences between the susceptible and resistant strains (interpopulational variation).", "num_citations": "23\n", "authors": ["2205"]}

Fifty-five specimens of E. perditus were captured in drop traps, then killed, necropsied, and examined for the presence of helminths in the gastrointestinal tract. Nematodes, including Strongyluris oscari, Oswaldocruzia subauricularis, and Aplectana vellardi, were found. This was the first record of the last-named species in reptiles, and the first record of the first 2 species in E. perditus. The number of helminths increased with snout-vent length and, therefore, age of the lizards. Male E. perditus lizards were more heavily infected by nematodes than females; the largest numbers of nematodes occurred in the caecum and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "21\n", "authors": ["2205"]}
{"title": "Genetic differences between strains of Biomphalaria glabrata (Planorbidae) that are susceptible and unsusceptible to schistosomiasis\n", "abstract": " Despite the implementation control programs, schistosomiasis continues to spread throughout the world. Among modern control strategies, vector control is currently being emphasized. Within this context, analysis of the genetic variability of intermediate host snails (Biomphalaria spp) is important because it allows identification of specific sequences of the genome of this mollusk related to susceptibility/resistance to Schistosoma mansoni infection. We investigated Brazilian albino (non-pigmented) and pigmented (wild type) strains of Biomphalaria glabrata; these strains differ in their susceptibility to S. mansoni infection. Genetic variability was studied by RAPD-PCR using different random primers. The electrophoretic patterns resulting from amplification showed specific polymorphic markers for the albino and pigmented strains of B. glabrata. This information will help in the identification and isolation of genes specifically related to susceptibility, demonstrating that RAPD-PCR is an appropriate and efficient methodological approach for analysis of the genetic variability of schistosomiasis vectors.", "num_citations": "19\n", "authors": ["2205"]}
{"title": "Differences in the number of hemocytes in the snail host Biomphalaria tenagophila, resistant and susceptible to Schistosoma mansoni infection\n", "abstract": " The relationships between schistosomiasis and its intermediate host, mollusks of the genus Biomphalaria, have been a concern for decades. It is known that the vector mollusk shows different susceptibility against parasite infection, whose occurrence depends on the interaction between the forms of trematode larvae and the host defense cells. These cells are called amebocytes or hemocytes and are responsible for the recognition of foreign bodies and for phagocytosis and cytotoxic reactions. The defense cells mediate the modulation of the resistant and susceptible phenotypes of the mollusk. Two main types of hemocytes are found in the Biomphalaria hemolymph: the granulocytes and the hyalinocytes. We studied the variation in the number (kinetics) of hemocytes for 24 h after exposing the parasite to genetically selected and non-selected strains of Biomphalaria tenagophila, susceptible or not to infection by Schistosoma mansoni. The differences were analyzed referred to the variations in the number of hemocytes in mollusks susceptible or not to infection by S. mansoni. The hemolymph of the selected and non-selected snails was collected, and hemocytes were counted using a Neubauer chamber at six designated periods: 0 h (control, non-exposed individuals), 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, 18 h and, 24 h after parasite exposure. Samples of hemolymph of five selected mollusks and five non-selected mollusks were separately used at each counting time. There was a significant variation in the number of hemocytes between the strains, which indicates that defense cells have different behaviors in resistant and susceptible mollusks.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["2205"]}
{"title": "Real-time dynamic image-source implementation for auralisation\n", "abstract": " This paper describes a software package for auralisation in inter- active virtual reality environments. Its purpose is to reproduce, in real time, the 3D soundfield within a virtual room where listener and sound sources can be moved freely. Output sound is presented binaurally using headphones. Auralisation is based on geometric acoustic models combined with head-related transfer functions (HRTFs): the direct sound and reflections from each source are computed dynamically by the image-source method. Directional cues are obtained by filtering these incoming sounds by the HRTFs corresponding to their propagation directions relative to the listener, computed on the basis of the information provided by a head-tracking device. Two interactive real-time applications were developed to demonstrate the operation of this software package. Both provide a visual representation of listener (position and head orientation) and sources (including image sources). One focusses on the auralisation-visualisation synchrony and the other on the dynamic calculation of reflection paths. Computational performance results of the auralisation system are presented.", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["2205"]}

SPLE has been successfully used in the development of safety-critical systems, especially in automotive and aerospace domains. Safety-critical systems have to be developed according to safety standards, which demands safety analysis, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and assurance cases safety engineering artefacts. However, performing safety analysis, FTA, and assurance case construction activities from scratch and manually for each product variant is time-consuming and error-prone, whereas variability in safety engineering artefacts can be automatically managed with the support of variant management techniques. As safety is context-dependent, context and design variation directly impact in the safety properties changing hazards, their causes, the risks posed by these hazards to system safety, risk mitigation measures, and FTA results. Therefore, managing variability in safety artefacts from different levels of abstraction increases the complexity of the variability model, even with the support of variant management techniques. To achieve an effective balance between benefits and complexity in adopting an SPLE approach for safety-critical systems it is necessary to distinguish between reusable safety artefacts, whose variability should be managed, and those that should be generated from the reused safety artefacts.

{"title": "Modelo e algoritmos para organiza\u00e7\u00e3o de redes de sensores sem fio ier\u00e1rquicas\n", "abstract": " Rede de Sensores Sem Fio (RSSF) \u00e9 uma tecnologia emergente que possibilita a habilidade de monitorar o mundo f\u00edsico atrav\u00e9s de uma rede de pequenos sensores densamente distribu\u00eddos. Um grande desafio nessas redes consiste na escassez de energia dispon\u00edvel nos sensores, fazendo com que trabalhos que procurem economizar energia e consequentemente prolongar a vida dessas redes seja um foco interessante. Outros temas de pesquisa nessas redes s\u00e3o os problemas de cobertura e roteamento. O objetivo deste trabalho consiste em propor uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o que trate conjuntamente os problemas de cobertura e roteamento considerando a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o hier\u00e1rquica dessas redes. Essa organiza\u00e7\u00e3o permite tirar vantagens dessas redes principalmente no que se refere \u00e0 economia de energia. Como solu\u00e7\u00e3o foi proposto um modelo de programa\u00e7\u00e3o linear inteira mista e diante da dificuldade de se obter solu\u00e7\u00f5es utilizando o modelo, a t\u00e9cnica de relaxa\u00e7\u00e3o Lagrangeana foi utilizada na elabora\u00e7\u00e3o de um algoritmo que possibilitasse obter boas solu\u00e7\u00f5es em menor tempo computacional. Para validar e avaliar as solu\u00e7\u00f5es, foram realizados testes a partir de um conjunto de inst\u00e2ncias fornecidas por um gerador desenvolvido para esse prop\u00f3sito. Os resultados num\u00e9ricos permitem validar as solu\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas com o modelo matem\u00e1tico e verificar ganhos da organiza\u00e7\u00e3o hier\u00e1rquica sobre a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o plana dessas redes. Os testes realizados com o objetivo de avaliar a qualidade do algoritmo mostram o seu ganho em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Cplex no que se refere ao tempo computacional para obter solu\u00e7\u00f5es, por\u00e9m os gaps de dualidade para o\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["2205"]}

Atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise de um fragmento do livro Os miser\u00e1veis do escritor franc\u00eas Vitor Hugo, busca-se atrav\u00e9s do uso dos conceitos de Devo\u00e7\u00e3o de Donald Winnicott e de entropatia de Edith Stein, realizar articula\u00e7\u00f5es, no intuito de mostrar o papel desses dois conceitos na estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o do cuidado estabelecido na rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre Monsenhor Benvindo e Jean Valjean, personagens do referido livro, para a mudan\u00e7a e transforma\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal deste \u00faltimo, em sua trajet\u00f3ria ap\u00f3s esse encontro.
