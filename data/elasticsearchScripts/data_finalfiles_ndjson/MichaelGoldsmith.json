Recent industry surveys and academic literature provide unequivocal evidence to support the significance of this threat and its prevalence. Despite this, however, there is still no unifying framework to fully characterise insider attacks and to facilitate an understanding of the problem, its many components and how they all fit together.

Those who have authorized access to sensitive organizational data are placed in a position of power that could well be abused and could cause significant damage to an organization. This could range from financial theft and intellectual property theft to the destruction of property and business reputation. Traditional intrusion detection systems are neither designed nor capable of identifying those who act maliciously within an organization. In this paper, we describe an automated system that is capable of detecting insider threats within an organization.

From a technology standpoint, traditional protective measures such as intrusion detection systems are largely inadequate given the nature of the \u2018insider\u2019 and their legitimate access to prized organisational data and assets. As a result, it is necessary to research and develop more sophisticated approaches for the accurate recognition, detection and response to insider threats. One way in which this may be achieved is by understanding the complete picture of why an insider may initiate an attack, and the indicative elements along the attack chain. This includes the use of behavioural and psychological observations about a potential malicious insider in addition to technological monitoring and profiling techniques. In this paper, we propose a framework for modelling the insider-threat problem that goes beyond traditional technological observations and incorporates a more complete view of insider threats, common precursors, and human actions and behaviours. We present a conceptual model for insider threat and a reasoning structure that allows an analyst to make or draw hypotheses regarding a potential insider threat based on measurable states from real-world observations.", "num_citations": "89\n", "authors": ["1639"]}

Undoubtedly, one of the main motivations for this is the increase in attacks (e.g., social engineering and phishing) which exploit humans and exemplify why many authors regard them as the weakest link in the security chain. As research in the socio-technical security and trust fields gains momentum, it is crucial to intermittently pause and reflect on their progress while also considering related domains to determine whether there are any established principles which may be transferred.

Such information systems will be relied upon to provide adequate data security. It is imperative that techniques be developed to assure the trustworthiness of the technologies from which they are built. Formal verification provides the tools and techniques to assess whether systems are indeed trustworthy, and is an established approach for security assurance. When using formal verification for security assessment one of the most important concerns should be to be precise about the threat model. In the now extensive field of the formal analysis of crypto-protocols, the Dolev-Yao threat model is the de facto standard.

High-level approaches tend to address privacy as an afterthought in ordinary business practice, and involve ad hoc enforcement practices; low-level approaches often leave out important legal and business considerations focusing solely on technical management of privacy policies.

While the Internet and Web 2.0 have been pivotal in streamlining many of the information creation and dissemination processes, they have significantly complicated matters for users as well. Most notably, the substantial increase in the amount of content available online has introduced an information overload problem, while also exposing content with largely unknown levels of quality, leaving many users with the difficult question of, what information to trust? In this article we approach this problem from two perspectives, both aimed at supporting human decision-making using online information. First, we focus on the task of measuring the extent to which individuals should trust a piece of openly-sourced information (e.g., from Twitter, Facebook or a blog); this considers a range of factors and metrics in information provenance, quality and infrastructure integrity, and the person\u2019s own preferences and opinion. Having calculated a measure of trustworthiness for an information item, we then consider how this rating and the related content could be communicated to users in a cognitively-enhanced manner, so as to build confidence in the information only where and when appropriate.

We present the results of a small-scale experiment which demonstrates that it is possible for malicious actors to gain covert access to a voice-controlled system by hiding commands in apparently nonsensical sounds of which the meaning is opaque to humans. Several instances of nonsensical word sequences were identified which triggered a target command in a voice-controlled digital assistant, but which were incomprehensible to humans, as shown in tests with human experimental subjects.

Both are based upon the Superi-dentity model that brings together cyber and physical spaces into a single understanding of identity. Between them, the tools provide support for defensive, information gathering and capability planning operations. The first tool allows an analyst to explore and understand the model, and to apply it to risk-exposure assessment activities for a particular individual, e.g. an influential person in the intelligence or government community, or a commercial company board member. It can also be used to understand critical capabilities in an organization's identity-attribution process, and so used to plan resource investment. The second tool, referred to as Identity Map, is designed to support investigations requiring enrichment of identities and the making of attributions.

The threat from accidental insiders is a reality across all enterprises and can be extremely damaging to the systems, data and reputation of an organisation. Recent industry reports and academic literature underline the fact that the risk of accidental insider compromise is potentially more pressing than that posed by a malicious insider. In this paper we focus on the ability of enterprises' information security policies to mitigate the accidental insider threat.

Understanding the socio-technical challenges faced by law enforcement\n", "abstract": " Cybercrime investigators face numerous challenges when policing online crimes. Firstly, the methods and processes they use when dealing with traditional crimes do not necessarily apply in the cyber-world. Additionally, cyber criminals are usually technologically-aware and constantly adapting and developing new tools that allow them to stay ahead of law enforcement investigations. In order to provide adequate support for cybercrime investigators, there needs to be a better understanding of the challenges they face at both technical and socio-technical levels. In this paper, we investigate this problem through an analysis of current practices and workflows of investigators. We use interviews with experts from government and private sectors who investigate cybercrimes as our main data gathering process. From an analysis of the collected data, we identify several outstanding challenges faced by investigators. These pertain to practical, technical, and social issues such as systems availability, usability, and in computer-supported collaborative work. Importantly, we use our findings to highlight research areas where user-centric workflows and tools are desirable. We also define a set of recommendations that can aid in providing a better foundation for future research in the field and allow more effective combating of cybercrimes.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1639"]}

Security analysts working in SOCs generally monitor networks using a combination of anomaly-detection techniques, Intrusion Detection Systems and data presented in visual and text-based forms. In the last two decades significant progress has been made in developing novel sonification systems to further support network-monitoring tasks, but many of these systems have not been sufficiently validated, and there is a lack of uptake in SOCs. Furthermore, little guidance exists on design requirements for the sonification of network data. In this paper, we identify the key role that sonification, if implemented correctly, could play in addressing shortcomings of traditional network-monitoring methods. Based on a review of prior research, we propose an approach to developing sonification systems for network monitoring. This approach involves the formalisation of a model for designing sonifications in this space; identification of sonification design aesthetics suitable for realtime network monitoring; and system refinement and validation through comprehensive user testing. As an initial step in this system development, we present a formalised model for designing sonifications for network-security monitoring.

While the security and privacy of email has been of concern to enterprises and individuals for decades, this has predominately been focused on protecting against malicious content in incoming emails and explicit data exfiltration, rather than inadvertent leaks in outgoing emails. In this paper, we consider this topic of outgoing emails and unintentional information leakage to better appreciate the security and privacy concerns related to the simple activity of sending an email. Specifically, our research seeks to investigate the extent to which potentially sensitive information could be leaked, in even blank emails, by considering the metadata that is a natural part of email headers.

{"title": "Towards a User and Role-based Sequential Behavioural Analysis Tool for Insider Threat Detection\n", "abstract": " Insider threat is recognised to be a significant problem and of great concern to both corporations and governments alike. Traditional intrusion detection systems are known to be ineffective due to the extensive knowledge and capability that insiders typically have regarding the organisational setup. Instead, more sophisticated measures are required to analyse the actions performed by those within the organisation, to assess whether their actions suggest that they pose a threat. In this paper, we propose a proof-of-concept that focuses on the use of activity trees to establish sequential-based analysis of employee behaviour. This concept combines the notions of previously-proposed techniques such as attack trees and behaviour trees. For a given employee, we define a tree that can represent all sequences of their observed behaviours. Over time, branches are either appended or created to reflect the new observations that are made on how the employee acts. We also incorporate a similarity measure to establish how different branches compare against each other. Attacks can be defined as where the similarity measure between a newly-observed branch and all existing branches is below a given acceptance criteria. The approach would allow an analyst to observe chains of events that result in low probability activities that could be deemed as unusual and therefore may be malicious. We demonstrate our proof-of-concept using third-party synthetic employee activity logs, to illustrate the practicalities of delivering this form of protective monitoring.", "num_citations": "14\n", "authors": ["1639"]}

For this experiment, we conducted our investigation on five forums collected in previous work as part of the Dark Web Forum portal and built upon the tool support created in our previous research in order to visualise and analyse the network. Whilst existing work attempts to identify these structures through stateof-the-art Computational Linguistic techniques, our work relies on the communication metadata alone. Our analysis involved first calculating a range of SNA metrics to better understand the group members, and then apply unsupervised learning in order to create clusters that would help classify the Dark Web Forums users into hierarchical clusters. In order to create our social networks, we investigated the effect of repeated author resolution and various weighting schemes on the ranking of forum members by creating four social networks per forum and evaluating the correlation of the top n users (for n= 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100). Our results identified that varying the weighting schemes created more consistent ranking schemes than varying the repeated author resolution.", "num_citations": "7\n", "authors": ["1639"]}

Insider threats encompass anyone or thing which exploits authorised access to company information and resources to steal, corrupt or disrupt assets. Threat actors could include not only employees, but also contractors, trusted partners and in some cases clients. The nature of their access is usually persistent, as it is valid and required to conduct their roles, and as such, abuse of their privileges can pose a serious and real threat to the successful operation of the business. Whilst measures have been proposed for detecting previous attacks or those currently in progress, what would be much more desirable is to detect employees who are possibly becoming vulnerable to coercion or persuasion into conducting an attack of some form\u2013enabling supportive or preventative action by the organisation to avoid escalation of an attack. Research into psychology and behaviour is indicating that it may be possible to detect such human vulnerability through analysis of language used\u2013linguistics. In this paper we present a visual analytics tool for the assessment of sociolinguistic behaviours exhibited via e-mail communications, aimed at helping to identify people who are potentially at risk. We discuss the visual designs choices made to provide both detail and overview for the analyst for studying communications within a large group of users, and demonstrate this for a large real-world dataset of over 600 employees.

The problem they are designed to address is clearly real and formidable, although relatively little has been done to measure how effective such national responses are in mitigating the threats posed by cyber-criminals and state-sponsored cyber-attacks. The goal of this paper is to take a first step towards developing metrics which can be used to measure the effectiveness of CSIRTs. A primary motive for doing so is to enable more effective CSIRTs to be implemented, which focus on activities with the maximum impact on threat mitigation. More specifically, this paper aims to identify the ways in which a CSIRT might be deemed to be effective, and possible approaches towards developing CSIRT effectiveness metrics. It also identifies the issues that need to be addressed to realise the goal. Issues such as cooperation, data sharing and trust are discussed as crucial components of an effective CSIRT.

Using abstraction-based reasoning our model allows enterprises to achieve \u201csome\u201d situational awareness during a System Failure, but more importantly, enable them to act upon their understanding and to justify their decisions.

{"title": "Assessing a Decision Support Tool for SOC Analysts\n", "abstract": " It is difficult to discern real-world consequences of attacks on an enterprise when investigating network-centric data alone. In recent years, many tools have been developed to help understand attacks using visualisation, but few aim to predict real-world consequences. We have developed a visualisation tool that aims to improve decision support during attacks in Security Operation Centres (SOCs). Our tool visualises propagation of risks from sensor alert data to Business Process (BP) tasks. This is an important capability gap present in many SOCs today, as most threat detection tools are technology-centric. In this article, we present a user study that assesses our tool\u2019s usability and ability to support the analyst. Ten analysts from seven SOCs performed carefully designed tasks related to understanding risks and recovery decision-making. The study was conducted in laboratory conditions with simulated attacks and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "Dataset construction and analysis of screenshot malware\n", "abstract": " Among the various types of spyware, screenloggers are distinguished by their ability to capture screenshots. This gives them considerable nuisance capacity, giving rise to theft of sensitive data or, failing that, to serious invasions of the privacy of users. Several examples of attacks relying on this screen capture feature have been documented in recent years. However, there is not sufficient empirical and experimental evidence on this topic. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset dedicated to screenshot-taking malware until today. The lack of datasets or common testbed platforms makes it difficult to analyse and study their behaviour in order to develop effective countermeasures. The screenshot feature is often a smart feature that does not activate automatically once the malware has infected the machine; the activation mechanisms of this function are often more complex. Consequently, a dataset\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "Black-Box Attacks via the Speech Interface Using Linguistically Crafted Input\n", "abstract": " This paper presents the results of experiments demonstrating novel black-box attacks via the speech interface. We demonstrate two types of attack that use linguistically crafted adversarial input to target vulnerabilities in the handling of speech input by a speech interface. The first attack demonstrates the use of nonsensical word sounds to gain covert access to voice-controlled systems. This attack exploits vulnerabilities at the speech recognition stage of handling of speech input. The second attack demonstrates the use of crafted utterances that are misinterpreted by a target system as a valid voice command. This attack exploits vulnerabilities at the natural language understanding stage of handling of speech input.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "Anomaly Detection Using Pattern-of-Life Visual Metaphors\n", "abstract": " Complex dependencies exist across the technology estate, users and purposes of machines. This can make it difficult to efficiently detect attacks. Visualization to date is mainly used to communicate patterns of raw logs, or to visualize the output of detection systems. In this paper we explore a novel approach to presenting cybersecurity-related information to analysts. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of using visualizations to make analysts become anomaly detectors using Pattern-of-Life Visual Metaphors. Unlike glyph metaphors, the visualizations themselves (rather than any single visual variable on screen) transform complex systems into simpler ones using different mapping strategies. We postulate that such mapping strategies can yield new, meaningful ways to showing anomalies in a manner that can be easily identified by analysts. We present a classification system to describe machine and human\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "On properties of cyberattacks and their nuances\n", "abstract": " PurposeSeveral attack models attempt to describe behaviours of attacks with the intent to understand and combat them better. However, all models are to some degree incomplete. They may lack insight about minor variations about attacks that are observed in the real world (but are not described in the model). This may lead to similar attacks being classified as the same type of attack, or in some cases the same instance of attack. The appropriate solution would be to modify the model or replace it entirely. However, doing so may be undesirable as the model may work well for most cases or time and resource constraints may factor in as well. This paper aims to explore the potential value of adding information about attacks and attackers to existing models.Design/methodology/approachThis paper investigates used cases of minor variations in attacks and how it may and may not be appropriate to communicate subtle\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "POSTER: Detection of Online Radical Content Using Multimodal Approach\n", "abstract": " Several criminal and terrorist organisations have benefited tremendously from the worldwide reach, growth, and speed of the Internet. By utilising the Internet and multiple social media platforms, they are now able to spread their views, widen their reach, and have opportunities to recruit people from all over the world. This has also given them a media platform to broadcast their messages and different propaganda material aiming to spread fear, radicalise and recruit potential members. Previous study has demonstrated that the use of Internet by terrorist groups has significantly increased in the recent years [1]. Several social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are working towards keeping these platforms clean by suspending those who are promoting violent content or extremist behaviour. However, due to the volume and speed of the generated data it is still challenging to detect those misbehaving users accurately and in a timely manner. Recent research has focused on studying the online behaviour of pro-extremists users mainly by performing contentbased analysis in order to identify distinguishing textual features that can aid in automatic detection of these users [2]. However, using this approach alone has several shortcomings including producing a large number of false positives, having a high dependency on the data, and it can be easily evaded by adapting the users writing styles through automated tools. Ashcroft et al. make an attempt to automatically detect Jihadist messages on Twitter [2]. They adopt a machine-learning method to classify tweets as ISIS supporters or not. They focus on English tweets that contain a reference\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "The Relative Effectiveness of widely used Risk Controls and the Real Value of Compliance\n", "abstract": " As the volume of cyber-attacks continues to rise and also the levels of harm suffered from them, it is becoming critical that organisations can demonstrate that reasonable efforts are being undertaken to reduce cyber-risk. However, the risk responses and controls typically viewed as necessary, and even essential, by the professional and expert community are generally not underpinned by any framework that facilitates rigorous reasoning, qualification or quantification of the benefits resulting from their deployment. This means that the real value of compliance, or the variability of compliance, to risk-control standards is not well reasoned or measurable in any scientific, unambiguous or verifiable sense.This further means that methods used to manage, mitigate or transfer the risk by stakeholders across the information security and cyber risk landscapeare existing increasingly in isolation. Our study here has shown that a more rigorous risk valuation and risk management environment can only fully exists where transparent and effective collaboration between stakeholders exists. Only through such collaboration can risk be fully understood, modelled, valued and thus managed.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "Information trustworthiness as a solution to the misinformation problems in social media\n", "abstract": " The advent of the Internet has reshaped the way we communicate and interact in our daily lives. It provides an ideal medium through which we can share information and ideas, form groups, and contribute to a variety of discussions. In this position paper, we focus specifically on the information now available online \u2013 especially content from social media \u2013 to consider in detail the challenges that such information poses to modern-day society. Typical examples of challenges include the prevalence of mistaken information and deliberate misinformation and rumours. With an understanding of these challenges, we then introduce the notion of information-trustworthiness measures as a potential solution to the problem of misinformation in social media. The idea here is to use quality and trust metrics to assess information, and then, based on values attained, advise users whether or not they should trust the content. This paper extends our previous research in the field by assessing the misinformation problem in much greater detail, and also presenting our current agenda for future work.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
{"title": "Formalising Requirements for a Biobank Case Study Using a Logic for Consent and Revocation\n", "abstract": " In this paper we focus on formalising privacy requirements for the Oxford Radcliffe Biobank (ORB) case study that has emerged within the EnCoRe project. We express the requirements using a logic designed for reasoning about the dynamics of privacy and specifically for capturing the lifecycle of consent and revocation (C&R) controls that a user may invoke. We demonstrate how to tackle ambiguities uncovered in the formalisation and to bridge the gap between user requirements for personal data privacy and system level policy languages effectively.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["1639"]}
