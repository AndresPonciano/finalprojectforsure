{"title": "How Process Enactment Data Affects Product Defectiveness Prediction-A Case Study\n", "abstract": " The quality of a software product is highly influenced by the software process used to develop it. However, abstract and dynamic nature of the software process makes its measurement difficult, and this difficulty has supported the assessment insight of indirectly measuring the performance of software process by using the characteristics of the developed product. In fact, enactment of the software process might have a significant effect on product characteristics and data, and therefore, on the use of measurement and analysis results. In this article, we report a case study that aimed to investigate the effect of process enactment data on product defectiveness in a small software organization. We carried out the study by defining and following a methodology that included the application of Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach to direct analysis, the utilization of a questionnaire to assess usability of metrics, and the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["380"]}

In case the organization is working with more than one process reference model and/or standard, tracking compliance of the organization\u2019s processes to each is getting more complicated. Many times, it becomes a necessity to utilize support tools to perform process management activities. Developing ontology of each process reference model and/or standard and representing it by using a shareable, machine-understandable language would be a suitable solution to provide such support. Therefore, with the purpose of developing an ontology based software process assessment tool, we developed the ontology of CMMI for Development by using Web Ontology Language and we have developed an Eclipse plug-in to display that ontology in Eclipse Process Framework. This paper presents in detail the ontology of CMMI for Development.", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["380"]}

{"title": "Neural Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews to Predict User Ratings\n", "abstract": " The significance of user satisfaction is increasing in the competitive open source software (OSS) market. Application stores let users send their feedbacks for applications, which are in the form of user reviews or ratings. Developers are informed about bugs or any additional requirements with the help of this feedback and use it to increase the quality of the software. Moreover, potential users rely on this information as a success indicator to decide downloading the applications. Since it is usually costly to read all the reviews and evaluate their content, the ratings are taken as the base for the assessment. This makes the consistency of the contents with the ratings of the reviews important for healthy evaluation of the applications. In this study, we use recurrent neural networks to analyze the reviews automatically, and thereby predict the user ratings based on the reviews. We apply transfer learning from a huge volume\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["380"]}
{"title": "Complexity, size and internal quality in the evolution of mobile applications: an exploratory study\n", "abstract": " Mobile applications are becoming complex software systems as they rapidly evolve and grow constantly to meet user requirements. However, satisfying these requirements may lead to poor design choices known as `antipatterns' that can degrade software quality and performance. Therefore, perception and monitoring of the characteristics of mobile applications are important activities to facilitate maintenance and development, so that developers are directed to restructure their practices and upgrade their qualifications. This study aims to better understand the development of complexity, size and internal quality in the evolution of mobile applications and, in particular, to investigate the validity of three of Lehman's laws (increasing complexity, continuous growth, decreasing quality) in mobile applications. In this context, an exploratory study was carried out by analyzing the evolution of application quality, according to hypotheses established and using object-oriented design metrics in 61 versions of three Android-based mobile applications. As a result of the analyses, Lehman's `continuous growth' law was validated for all apps, while the `increased complexity' and `declining quality' laws have not been validated. In addition, the results of the experimental study have been verified with Spearman correlation analysis and it was observed that there is a significant relation between the design metrics and the quality attributes.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["380"]}
{"title": "An Investigation into Increased Agility by Balancing Agile and Traditional Process Approaches\n", "abstract": " The agile software development (ASD) has come with a biased approach against to its traditional counterparts because of expunging it by overriding to create a reasonable ground for its own benefit. This approach has created a comfort zone at its extreme edge and associated weakness for the agility in software development even though the absolute agility is a right for beyond such a zone. Thus, this study suggests balancing and normalizing the ASD with traditional approaches for a broader, sustainable and less context-based agility. We begin by identifying the topics the ASD should improve with the contribution of traditional approaches. Each corresponding topic is then elaborated with suggestions based on the strengths of the traditional approaches to reach a middle ground to combine the advantages of the both and fix the shortfalls of the agile development.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["380"]}

{"title": "Meta-models for Software Quality and Its Evaluation: A Systematic Literature Review\n", "abstract": " Software quality has been a very critical issue in software engineering for the last four decades and still maintains its importance. Various quality models with different characteristics have been proposed for quality evaluation of software products. Also, static code analysis tools have been widely used to measure specific characteristics of software in fixed quality models. In order to combine the isolated views on software quality and its evaluation (SQiE), metamodels that formalize whole or partial aspects of software quality models as a base for tool support or further research have been proposed in literature. In this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to comprehensively examine the meta-models proposed for SQiE in scientific literature is reported, with an aim to understand their purpose of use, content, and structure. The most-known seven digital libraries were searched, and 28 studies were identified out of 114 initially selected and 6488 initially retrieved in this area between 1997-2020. Results show that majority of meta-models are for general purposes, take ISO 9126 as reference and propose for various types of software. Most of them evaluate quality objectively using metric data and provide quantitative results.

With this thesis, applications developed for mobile and desktop platforms have been examined in terms of design criteria, source code size and platform dependency and it has been researched whether a similarity can be established between these platforms. In this direction, four research questions were constructed by adopting the method of exploratory research:(1) How is the design of mobile and desktop applications, in terms of object oriented metrics?(2) How is the size of mobile and desktop applications in terms of source code size?(3) How are applications developed for mobile and desktop platforms different in terms of dependencies?(4) Can similarities be identified between the applications developed for these two platforms? To answer these questions, the source code for the mobile and desktop versions of two open source applications has been examined and iv analyzed in a comparative way. It was found that the results obtained for the DIT and WMC metrics in the C & K metric set, which is used in the design evaluation, are higher in the desktop applications, and the values for the RFC and CBO metrics are higher in the mobile applications.

{"title": "Systematic analysis of the incremental process as a base for comparison with the agile process\n", "abstract": " Background: The number of studies that quantitatively reveal the effect of using Agile models on development performance is scarce. Aim: In this paper, we explain the analysis of a plan-driven. Incremental Process within Siemens EC. carried out to understand its performance as a base for the comparison with the Agile Process. Method: We introduce a method to systematically analyze a software development process to understand its performance quantitatively, and explain the application of the method on the System Test phase of the Incremental Process. Results: The utilization of the analysis method practically contributed to the implementation which was completed in 8 person-days. An analysis of derived measure values indicated that there was no outlier value in the interval of mean \u00b1 3 standard deviation for the measures. Conclusions: We expect that the method will be more beneficial in capturing the\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["380"]}
