{"title": "Development, extension, and application: a review of the technology acceptance model\n", "abstract": " With the continued implementation of a wide range of technologies both by individuals and within organizations, user acceptance remains a significant area of study. The question of why people decide to accept or reject a particular technology continues to be an important issue. Numerous models have been developed and applied to a broad scope of technologies. One of the most influential and often used models for examining user acceptance is the Technology Acceptance Model or TAM. Although seminal articles were written almost two decades ago, this model continues to be used extensively. This paper examines the development, extension, and application of TAM and identifies three specific areas for future research. It contributes to information systems educators by providing faculty with a foundation from which to guide students in the area of technology acceptance research as well as a starting point from which to evaluate emerging technologies for potential classroom use. In general, this paper provides a relatively brief, but informative, overview of TAM for those interested in user acceptance of technology.", "num_citations": "139\n", "authors": ["2242"]}
{"title": "Exploring educational and cultural adaptation through social networking sites.\n", "abstract": " Social networking sites have seen tremendous growth and are widely used around the world. Nevertheless, the use of social networking sites in educational contexts is an under explored area. This paper uses a qualitative methodology, autoethnography, to investigate how social networking sites, specifically FacebookTM, can help first semester doctoral students adapt to a Ph. D. program and a new national culture. Each week during the semester, a Ph. D. Student Tip and a Cultural Tip was posted. Students would then post related discussions, observations, and/or questions. At the conclusion of the semester the doctoral students shared their thoughts about participating in the Facebook\u2122 group through autobiographical narratives. A technique called open coding was used to analyze the narratives. Our findings suggest three emergent themes. Social networking sites can aid adaptation through: 1) facilitating knowledge exchange, 2) alleviating apprehension, and 3) enabling socialization and building community. The data showed that the Facebook\u2122 discussions aided in various types of knowledge exchange, providing a conceptual map that facilitated greater adaptation. Next, the interactions appeared to help minimize trepidation related to embarking on a new program of study and adjusting to a new national culture. Third, the Facebook\u2122 group was useful fostering socialization and community among the students. We make the following recommendations for professors when implementing SNS (Social Network Site) groups: 1) establish a Facebook\u2122 group with a course-related identity, 2) be sensitive to security and privacy issues, 3\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "125\n", "authors": ["2242"]}

{"title": "Agile in teaching and learning: Conceptual framework and research agenda\n", "abstract": " Agile software development methods are widespread in industry, and there is a wealth of academic research and practitioner publications currently available from this perspective. With the rise of Agile within companies worldwide, it is increasingly important for information systems education to keep up with this trend to ensure curriculum and courses are up-to-date. Students in the computing disciplines must be prepared to enter a job market where Agile is commonplace. As such, the topic of Agile in teaching and learning is critically important. The current special issue includes a rich collection of articles providing information systems educators with research-based, practical approaches for both teaching Agile (\u201cthe what\u201d) and using Agile as a pedagogical approach (\u201cthe how\u201d). In an effort to assist information systems educators categorize the growing amount of literature related to Agile in teaching and learning, a conceptual framework is provided which places the literature along the two axes of pedagogy (\u201cthe how\u201d) and the content (\u201cthe what\u201d) ranging from other, non-Agile to Agile. Finally, the authors present a call for future research integrating Agile on a meta-level in the course development process.

Its focus is on the integration of pre-fabricated software components to build systems that increase portability and flexibility. CBSD purports to address the problem of systems which are delivered behind schedule, over-budget, and inadequately meeting user requirements. A major contribution of this work is providing a solid theoretical foundation using Simon's (1977) problem solving model and the tenets of design science to the emerging CBSD paradigm which has lacked a theoretical-base. In doing so, we construct a theoretical framework of the CBSD development phases by synthesizing the current CBSD related literature and developing propositions for guiding future research.

{"title": "Enhancing Student Success in Online Learning Experiences Through the Use of Self-Regulation Strategies\n", "abstract": " Online learning experiences have greatly changed the landscape of instruction. Many courses in postsecondary environments incorporate some type of technological enhancement, which holds benefits for both postsecondary institutions and learners. However, online learning experiences require different pedagogical characteristics than traditional learning experiences, and learners must be able to self-regulate. The purpose of this article is to define self-regulation and explain what it looks like in both traditional and online learning contexts. The article also describes several research-based instructional design strategies to assist with the development of self-regulation among learners through use of performance-progress tools, time-management tools, and learning-enhancement tools.The rise of popularity and demand for online learning experiences has greatly changed the landscape of instruction (Hoskins, 2011). The US Department of Education (2011) reported that by 2008, approximately 20% of all undergraduate students had taken at least one course offered in an online learning format. This number continues to grow in postsecondary education and has even begun to impact instructional delivery within the K-12 grades (Hoskins, 2011).", "num_citations": "22\n", "authors": ["2242"]}
