While several methodological and technological proposals for developing Web applications are coining both from industry and academia, there is a general lack of methods and tools to carry out the key processes that significantly impact the quality of a Web application (WA), such as the validation & verification (V&V), and quality assurance. Some open issues in the field of Web application testing are addressed in this paper.

The software industry is facing the new demand under the pressure of a very short time-to-market and an extremely high competition. As a result, Web sites and applications are usually developed without a disciplined process: Web applications are directly coded and no, or poor, documentation is produced to support the subsequent maintenance and evolution activities, thus compromising the quality of the applications. This paper presents a tool for reverse engineering Web applications. UML diagrams are used to model a set of views that depict several aspects of a Web application at different abstraction levels.

{"title": "Identifying cross site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications\n", "abstract": " Cross site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability of a Web application that is essentially caused by the failure of the application to check up on user input before returning it to the client's Web browser. Without an adequate validation, user input may include malicious code that may be sent to other clients and unexpectedly executed by their browsers, thus causing a security attack. Techniques to prevent this type of attacks require that all application input must be checked up and filtered, encoded, or validated before sending them to any user. In order to discover the XSS vulnerabilities in a Web application, traditional source code analysis techniques can be exploited. In this paper, in order to assess the XSS vulnerability of a Web application, an approach that combines static and dynamic analysis of the Web application is presented.

However, the graphical representations become progressively less useful with large-scale applications, and do not support adequately the comprehension of the application. To overcome this limitation, we propose an approach based on a clustering method for decomposing a Web application (WA) into groups of functionally related components.

{"title": "An algebraic notation for representing threads in object oriented software comprehension\n", "abstract": " In object oriented systems a thread represents a chain of method activations started by an input event and terminating when an output event is generated. Functional requirements can be implemented by a single thread or by a combination of more threads. Thread analysis can be used as a tool for understanding object oriented software behavior and to support maintenance tasks. The paper presents an algebraic notation, called MM-exp, for representing the threads, that expressively describes relevant details about thread composition. An approach to carry out comprehension processes based on the MM-exp notation is discussed, and a technique to support testing activities guided by the threads is also presented. The proposed approaches are experimented with a case study involving a small sized system implemented in C++ language. The experiment results show that the MM-exp analysis effectively supports\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "3\n", "authors": ["72"]}
{"title": "Profiling cancer-related needs and the role of physical, practical and psychological difficulties: A latent class analysis approach.\n", "abstract": " e22161Background: There was an increasing attention to the humanization of oncological cares that focused on patients\u2019 needs \u2013 which have a strong impact on quality of life. Cancer-related needs seem to be related both to physical, practical and psychological difficulties as well as gender and age. Using a Latent Class Analysis (LCA) the aim of the study was to identify a latent structure accounting for the covariance between cancer-related needs. A one-factor model with two classes was hypothesized, which comprised needs as indicators and difficulties as external variables that moderate the latent structure. Methods: Patients (N = 171, 50.3% female, mean age = 64.6, SD = 12.7) were enrolled at the Department of Medical Oncology, \u201cPresidio Ospedaliero\u201d of Saronno, ASST Valle Olona, Italy. Using a standardized checklist patients were tested for physical issues, practical problems and distress (Psychological\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["72"]}
{"title": "A Taxonomy of Interactions Introduced by Aspects\n", "abstract": " Aspects have a large impact on the static structure and dynamic behaviour of the system they belong. This is due to the intrinsic intrusive nature of aspects and the woven process allowing the alteration of the structure, the control and data flow of the components of the base system in aspect oriented (AO) systems. Several and different types of interactions among aspects and the other components can be introduced according to the different mechanisms provided by AO Programming. These interactions can make higher the complexity of the overall system affecting its comprehension. In this paper we propose a taxonomy to categorize these types of interactions among aspects and the components of the base system. The taxonomy can be used to understand how each type of interaction affects the complexity, and thus the comprehensibility, of the system.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["72"]}
{"title": "Assuring quality of web-based applications\n", "abstract": " The Internet is rapidly expanding into all sectors of our society and becoming an indispensable platform of information systems and other computer applications. Web-based applications are complex, ever evolving and rapidly updated software systems. Testing and maintaining web-based applications impose a challenge to existing software quality assurance and testing techniques because the Internet is a heterogeneous, distributed, multiplatform, multilingual, multimedia, autonomous, and cooperative wide area network computing environment. Traditional quality models, testing methods and tools are not adequate for web-based applications because they do not address problems associated with the new features of web-based applications.With support from and in conjunction with IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conferences (COMPSAC), a series of international workshops on Quality\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["72"]}

{"title": "Formal Verification of Radio Communication Management in Railway Systems Using Model Checking Technique\n", "abstract": " The European Railway Traffic Management System has the purpose to provide a common signaling system for all the European nations. It consists of two subsystems: the trackside subsystem (TSS) and the on-board subsystem (OBS) that communicate to exchange information about the state of the trackside and/or the train. Radio communication can take place according to the requirements specification reported in ERTMS/ETCS SUBSET-026-3. As the communication between TSS and OBS is a critical issue, we exploit model checking to verify the correctness of the communication process as specified in the SUBSET-026-3. The results achieved during the experimentation seem to be very promising.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["72"]}
