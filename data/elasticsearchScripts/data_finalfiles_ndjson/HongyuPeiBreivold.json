Therefore, ensuring quality of service (QoS) through service-level agreements (SLAs) for such cloud-based services is crucial for both the service providers and service consumers. As SLAs are critical for cloud deployments and wider adoption of cloud services, the management of SLAs in cloud and IoT has thus become an important and essential aspect. This paper investigates the existing research on the management of SLAs in IoT applications that are based on cloud services. For this purpose, a systematic mapping study (a well-defined method) is conducted to identify the published research results that are relevant to SLAs.

In the meanwhile, we have through our practical experiences in scaling up agile methods, noticed that architecture plays an important role. Due to the inter-relationship between agile methods and architecture, as well as divergent perceptions on their correlation stated in numerous sources, we are motivated to find out how these perceptions are supported by findings in the research community in general and in empirical studies in particular. To fully benefit from agile practices and architectural disciplines, we need empirical data on the perceived and experienced impacts of introducing agile methods to existing software development process, as well as correlations between agile and architecture.

In the automation industry, clouds are often used for monitoring vast amounts of data generated on the shop floor. Whereas, IoT is used to simplify the end devices and their connections to the rest of the system. In this paper we investigate the interplay of these two concepts and their use in the control applications in the automation industry. We develop a prototype in the industrial setup to explore the use of IoT devices that communicate with a cloud-based controller. Using the prototype, we perform a number of experiments to investigate the consequences of having a cloud server between the end device and the controller. Within this context we consider arbitrary jitter and delays, ie, they can be smaller, equal or greater than the sampling periods. Moreover, we apply mitigation mechanisms to deal with the delays and jitter that are caused by the local and wide area networks (LAN and WAN).", "num_citations": "6\n", "authors": ["990"]}

Due to the longevity of industrial systems, reusability and evolvability are often considered crucial quality attributes. This paper presents a new flexible task design that enables tasks to be agnostic to run-time context. Evaluations of the design were made by conducting experiments using a proof of concept implementation of the proposed design. The experiments were based on typical industrial constructs, such as periodic tasks, and event signaling from interrupts. Findings from the experiments show that tasks can be more agnostic to run-time context and still deliver functionality normally used within industry. The results indicate that it is feasible to improve reusability and evolvability between different run-time contexts, and in addition, support hybrid\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["990"]}

The use of simulators that provides easily reproducible evaluations is often limited, due to different levels of abstraction, e.g., programming languages and run-time contexts. This paper extends previous work on a flexible task design, enabling tasks to be agnostic to run-time context, with evaluations conducted on bare-metal and real-time operating systems. Based on the same design and experiments we extend the proof-of-concept implementation in a discrete event simulation context, executing on a Windows based simulation host.

Therefore, ensuring the quality of service through service-level agreements for such cloud-based services is crucial for both the service providers and service consumers. Within the context of industrial IoT applications, modeling of the service-level agreements has not received much attention in the existing literature. In this paper, we discuss ongoing work on modeling of service-level agreements to ensure quality of service in industrial IoT applications. The modeling approach aims to consider the agreements between an end device and the cloud; between a service provider and a service user; and among cloud services. The approach also aims to model the service-level agreements when a company assumes a double role, being the provider as well as the user of the services. We aim to provide a proof of concept by developing a prototype in an industrial setup. Using the prototype, we plan to show usability of the approach.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["990"]}
