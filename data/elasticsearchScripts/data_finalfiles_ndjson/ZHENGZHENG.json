{"title": "Adequate is better: particle swarm optimization with limited-information\n", "abstract": " Based on the interaction of individuals, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a well-recognized algorithm to find optima in search space. In its canonical version, the trajectory of each particle is usually influenced by the best performer among its neighborhood, which thus ignores some useful information from other neighbors. To capture information of all the neighbors, the fully informed PSO is proposed, which, however, may bring redundant information into the search process. Motivated by both scenarios, here we present a particle swarm optimization with limited information, which provides each particle adequate information yet avoids the waste of information. By means of systematic analysis for the widely-used standard test functions, it is unveiled that our new algorithm outperforms both canonical PSO and fully informed PSO, especially for multimodal test functions.

However, it does not always come up to the expectation due to the diversity of the owned information and the shared information. Motivated by this, in this work we investigate the impacts of sharing threat information on UAV path planning by figuring out the characteristics of threat environments with information sharing.

The main features of the model focus on the definition of granules and the problem solving methods with the help of the hierachical and nested structure of tolerance granular spaces. In this paper, we mainly discuss the issues about the definition of tolerance granules, the relations among granules, the composition and\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "11\n", "authors": ["480"]}
{"title": "Robustness of spectrum-based fault localisation in environments with labelling perturbations\n", "abstract": " Most fault localisation techniques take as inputs a faulty program and a test suite, and produce as output a ranked list of suspicious code locations at which the program may be defective. If only a small portion of the executions are labelled erroneously, we expect a fault localisation technique to be robust to these errors. However, it is not known which fault localisation techniques with high accuracy are robust and which techniques are best at finding faults under the trade-off between accuracy and robustness.In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the impacts of labelling perturbations on spectrum-based fault localisation techniques (SBFL) is presented from different aspects first. We theoretically analyse the influence of labelling perturbations on three relations among risk evaluation formulas and the effect of mislabelling cases on the ranking of faulty statements. Then, we conduct controlled experiments on 18\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["480"]}
{"title": "Evolution analysis of a UAV real-time operating system from a network perspective\n", "abstract": " With the flourishing development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the mission tasks of UAVs have become more and more complex. Consequently, a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) that provides operating environments for various mission services on these UAVs has become crucial, which leads to the necessity of having a deep understanding of an RTOS. In this paper, an empirical study is conducted on FreeRTOS, a commonly used RTOS for UAVs, from a complex network perspective. A total of 85 releases of FreeRTOS, from V2.4.2 to V10.0.0, are modeled as directed networks, in which the nodes represent functions and the edges denote function calls. It is found that the size of the FreeRTOS network has grown almost linearly with the evolution of the versions, while its main core has evolved steadily. In addition, a k-core analysis-based metric is proposed to identify major functionality changes of\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "10\n", "authors": ["480"]}

{"title": "A rejuvenation strategy of two-granularity software based on adaptive control\n", "abstract": " In the process of continuous operation in a software system, a series of phenomena could lead to performance degradation of the system, namely software aging. The loss caused by software aging can be reduced through proper rejuvenation strategies, the key to which is to determine the rejuvenation thresholds. Essence of some traditional methods is to set predetermined thresholds based on empirical data. However, in some systems where the memory is shared between operating system and application software (two-granularity software system), as the memory consumption is closely related to system performance and changes constantly, using empirical thresholds may cause system outage or waste of resources. In this paper, an adaptive strategy is adopted to optimize the thresholds. Instead of fixed thresholds, the method regularly regulates the thresholds by taking feedback information in the running\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "9\n", "authors": ["480"]}

Firstly, the Vicon Mx Motion Capture System is installed to obtain the attitudes and positions of the coaxial helicopter. Secondly, a PCTx converter for the radio controller is used to convert the control commands into PPM signals which are sent into the radio controller. Hence the attitude and translational motion can be controlled.

In this paper, we introduce a mechanism to dynamically allocate the delivering capacity into the data-packet traffic model on the coupled Internet autonomous-system-level network of South Korea and Japan, and focus on its effect on the transport efficiency. In this mechanism, the total delivering capacity is constant and the lowest-load node will give one unit delivering capacity to the highest-load node at each time step. It is found that the delivering capacity of busy nodes and non-busy nodes can be well balanced and the effective betweenness of busy nodes with interconnections is significantly reduced. Consequently, the transport efficiency such as average traveling time and packet arrival rate is remarkably improved. Our work may shed some light on the traffic dynamics in coupled networks.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["480"]}

This paper mainly focuses on two questions:(1) Whether the accuracy of fault localization can be improved by enriching the predicate execution information?(2) How to evaluate the relationship between the accuracy of fault localization and the augment of predicate execution information? Based on the researches related with the two questions, a new statistical method, called Pesla, is proposed, which introduces the predicate execution-sequences to enrich the predicate execution information. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that more predicate execution information can indeed improve the accuracy of the fault localization. Furthermore, if the predicate execution information of target program meets the algorithm's demand, the higher accuracy of the fault localization will be achieved as the more predicate execution information is used.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["480"]}

This paper models the threat environment, the UAV\u2019s maneuverability and sensory ability, and then designs several optimal strategies with respect to sampling, obstacle avoidance, path navigability and path smoothing globally and locally. Consequently, a quick and smooth convergence RRT (QS-RRT) is obtained, and two improved optimal motion planning algorithms are presented for both known and unknown task spaces. Simulation results show that the algorithms can not only guarantee the convergence and path safety, but more importantly shorten the flight distance and remarkably improve the path navigability and smoothness. Furthermore, the algorithms can trade-off between the optimal degree and computational efficiency, which will optimize the adaptability to different practical mission requirements.", "num_citations": "8\n", "authors": ["480"]}

As human judgement is required for MR identification, systematic MR generation has long been an important research area in MT. Additionally, due to the extra program executions required for follow-up test cases, some concerns have been raised about MT cost-effectiveness. Consequently, the reduction in testing costs associated with MT has become another important issue to be addressed. MR composition can address both of these problems. This technique can automatically generate new MRs by composing existing ones, thereby reducing the number of follow-up test cases. Despite this advantage, previous studies on MR composition have empirically shown that some composite MRs have lower fault detection capability than their corresponding component MRs.

UAV path planning algorithms, including A-Star, BLP(bi-level programming based algorithm), PSO(Particle Swarm Optimization) and RRT(Rapid-exploring Random Trees), are selected for the empirical study. Results demonstrate that RRT and BLP behave much better than A* and PSO, considering variance and scenario complexity.

Many approaches were proposed in order to locate faults effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we proposed a novel statistical approach by exploiting the statistical behavior of two sequentially connected predicates in the execution. If the predicates are regarded as the vertices of a graph, then the edges of the graph represent the transition of two sequential predicates in the execution trace of the program. The label of each edge is the frequency of each transition. For each edge, we apply hypothesis testing to evaluate the difference between edge evaluation bias in the passed runs and that in the failed runs.

The path planning is classified into three behaviors: path-searching (PS) behavior in the regional range, goal-seeking (GS) and virtual goal seeking(VGS) behavior in the global range. The UAVs detect threats information in real-time and share the information with each other. Target planner coordinates the GS and VGS according to all the known threats information and UAV's real-time position.

Based on the two kinds of models, granule sets based bilevel decision models are developed in this paper.

Besides functional issues, non-functional issues such as performance play an important role in evaluating services. Therefore, before the service deployment, it is necessary to check whether performance will meet its service-level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we use a novel approach to model an expanded homogeneous Continuous Time Markov Chain (HCTMC) of basic Web services structures by Phase-Type (PH) fitting.

This paper emphasizes a further exploration of the mechanism of SBFL metrics. We propose a visualization-based framework for metric analyses, in which metrics are interpreted by curves in the identified spectra space, and their performance can be illustrated by geometric properties.

{"title": "An adaptive control method for resource provisioning with resource utilization constraints in cloud computing\n", "abstract": " Cloud computing enables users to purchase virtual resources on demand; therefore, the service requests change over time. Dynamic resource provisioning for cloud computing has become a key challenge. To reduce the associated costs, resource utilization must be improved, and ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) to meet the service-level agreements (SLAs). However, it is difficult to improve the resource utilization level and maintain a high QoS with fluctuating workloads in shared cloud computing systems. In this paper, we propose an adaptive control method for resource provisioning in cloud computing systems to simultaneously improve the resource utilization, achieve a satisfactory QoS, and react to the dynamic workload. We proposed an approach integrating adaptive multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) control and radial basis function (RBF) neural network to react to the highly dynamic workloads, and precisely control the resource allocation to improve resource utilization based on the maximum allowable QoS requirements. Experiments based on real-world workloads show that the proposed approach jointly improves resource utilization, maintains a satisfactory QoS, and handles workload fluctuations in a coordinated manner.", "num_citations": "2\n", "authors": ["480"]}
{"title": "Exploring the instability of spectra based fault localization performance\n", "abstract": " Spectra Based Fault Localization (SBFL) is a technique to improve the efficiency of software fault localization. The performance of SBFL largely depends on the input information provided by an executed test suite. Due to the randomness existing in the testing process, the output of SBFL may not be stable. In practice, testers do not have the chance to run the whole testing process many times. They are not sure whether the actually obtained SBFL output has a large deviation from the ideal output (i.e. the SBFL output obtained under the assumption that the amount of testing resources is unlimited).

{"title": "Interdiction and fortification problem of supply system based on preferential attachment\n", "abstract": " Protections of facilities of supply systems have been studied for many years. With development of e-commerce and network technology and the economic globalization, modern supply systems with enormous scales are organized as distributed and multi-echelon networks, which can be recognized as a complex network system. Distributions of facilities in such supply networks are consistent with power-law distribution of complex system. In this paper, we consider interdiction and fortification problem of supply system based on preferential attachment (IFPA) which means that the demand nodes choose facility with largest satisfaction as their service supporter after interdiction. Then we formulate IFPA as a linear bi-level program and solve the IFPA model by tree search algorithm in a decentralized mode.

On this basis, we proceed to develop the path planning model based on the bi-level decision. In the process of the planning, we introduce heuristic optimal strategies to further improve the smoothness for the local path and the global path, and to raise the efficiency in path searching.

For example, a statement can be covered by numerous failure-revealing test cases, and also covered by numerous passed test cases. To get more indicators about the faulty components towards a better application of SBFL, we extend the scope of spectrum-based knowledge from the basic intuitions to the Characteristics of Spectra Distribution (CSDs for short).

{"title": "A cooperative network interdiction model and its optimization solution algorithm\n", "abstract": " Service disruptions due to deliberate sabotage are serious threats to supply systems. To alleviate the loss of accessibility caused by such disruptions, identifying the system vulnerabilities that would be worth strengthening is a critical problem in the field of Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). Today\u2019s supply systems tend to be attacked in a cooperative manner. A set of facilities of an infrastructure system would be struck by several attackers cooperatively to create the worst-case disruptions. In this case, the conventional critical infrastructure protection approach based on R-Interdiction Median models with Fortification (RIMF) does not work well because it does not consider the cooperative manner among attackers. To handle the problem, a Bi-objective Probabilistic Interdiction Median Model with Cooperative Attacks (BICA) is proposed in this work. It is formulated as a bi-objective nonlinear optimization model and solved by a modified multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Experiments verify the high interdiction losses of disruptions caused by cooperative attacks without any protection. Compared with the conventional model, the experimental results show that the BICA model can model the cooperative attacking problem effectively and that its evolutionary-based algorithm can solve the model efficiently.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["480"]}

Compared with r-interdiction median problem (RIM), PRIM-MS mainly has three characteristics: (1) Limited capacity for each facility; (2) Partial interdiction; (3) Multi-sourcing property for supply systems. PRIM-MS falls into bilevel programming in the form of leader-follower decisions, where the attacker tries to degrade system performance the most by determining offensive resources invested while the user rebuilds supply-demand relationship to reduce the influences by interdiction. In this paper, we model the problem as a single level heuristic model based on two heuristic strategies.

With local path-searching behaviors in regional ranges and global goal-seeking behaviors in holistic ranges, the method infers behavior weights using fuzzy reasoning embedded with feedback, and then coordinates the behaviors to generate new reference waypoints. In view of the deterministic decisions and the uncertain states of a UAV (unmanned air vehicle), chance constraints are adopted to probabilistically guarantee the UAV\u2019s safety at a required level. Simulation results in representative scenes prove that the method is able to rapidly generate convergent paths in obstacle-rich environments, as well as highly improve the path quality with respect to smoothness and probabilistic safety.", "num_citations": "1\n", "authors": ["480"]}

The insertion and query of closed itemsets can be rapidly made based on the data structure CI-forest, and the location of the associated historical closed itemsets in the stage of dealing with the new transaction is also facilitated by CI-forest.
