In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside.3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing.

One common approach to tubular object centerline extraction is based on intensity ridge traversal. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of initialization, noise, and singularities on intensity ridge traversal and present multiscale heuristics and optimal-scale measures that minimize these effects. Monte Carlo experiments using simulated and clinical data are used to quantify how these \"dynamic-scale\" enhancements address clinical needs regarding speed, accuracy, and automation. In particular, we show that dynamic-scale ridge traversal is insensitive to its initial parameter settings, operates with little additional computational overhead, tracks centerlines with subvoxel accuracy, passes branch points, and handles significant image noise.

{"title": "Measuring tortuosity of the intracerebral vasculature from MRA images\n", "abstract": " The clinical recognition of abnormal vascular tortuosity, or excessive bending, twisting, and winding, is important to the diagnosis of many diseases. Automated detection and quantitation of abnormal vascular tortuosity from three-dimensional (3-D) medical image data would, therefore, be of value. However, previous research has centered primarily upon two-dimensional (2-D) analysis of the special subset of vessels whose paths are normally close to straight. This report provides the first 3-D tortuosity analysis of clusters of vessels within the normally tortuous intracerebral circulation. We define three different clinical patterns of abnormal tortuosity. We extend into 3-D two tortuosity metrics previously reported as useful in analyzing 2-D images and describe a new metric that incorporates counts of minima of total curvature.

Characteristic vessel tortuosity abnormalities appear early during tumor development, affect initially healthy vessels, spread beyond the confines of tumor margins, and do not simply mirror tissue perfusion.

{"title": "Intensity ridge and widths for tubular object segmentation and description\n", "abstract": " Introduces a technique for the automated description of tubular objects in 3D medical images. The goal of automated 3D object description is to extract a representation which consistently details the location, size, and structure of objects in 3D images using minimal user interaction. Such a representation provides a means by which objects can be classified, quantifiably evaluated, and registered. It also serves as a region of interest specification for visualization processes. The technique presented in this paper is suited for generating representations of 3D objects with nearly circular cross sections which have, possibly as a result of a global operation (e.g., blurring), intensity extrema near their centers. Such tubular objects commonly occur within human anatomy (e.g., vessels and selected bones). The medial axis of each of these objects is well approximated by its intensity ridge.

{"title": "Registration and analysis of vascular images\n", "abstract": " We have developed a method for rigidly aligning images of tubes. This paper presents an evaluation of the consistency of that method for three-dimensional images of human vasculature. Vascular images may contain alignment ambiguities, poorly corresponding vascular networks, and non-rigid deformations, yet the Monte Carlo experiments presented in this paper show that our method registers vascular images with sub-voxel consistency in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, we show that the method's insensitivity to non-rigid deformations enables the localization, quantification, and visualization of those deformations.               Our method aligns a source image with a target image by registering a model of the tubes in the source image directly with the target image.

Quantitative measurement of vessel attributes over relevant vessel populations could thus provide an important means of diagnosing and staging disease.
