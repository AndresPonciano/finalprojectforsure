One of these studies indicated that the agonist-antagonist, buprenorphine, added to bupivacaine provided a longer period of postoperative analgesia than the traditional opiates, but in this study, it is impossible to determine the relative contributions of the local anesthetic and the opiate to the postoperative analgesia because of the extremely long duration of the anesthesia provided by the local anesthetic, bupivacaine. By repeating the study using a local anesthetic of a shorter duration, the present study delineates more clearly the contribution of the buprenorphine to postoperative analgesia when added to a shorter-acting local anesthetic.Methods Forty, healthy, consenting adult patients\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "132\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

A prospective randomized trial.\n", "abstract": " Nausea and vomiting are extremely common and most distressing side effects of high-dose cisplatin therapy. Cisplatin induces anticipatory and acute, as well as, delayed emesis. High doses of metoclopramide can effectively decrease the intensity of these symptoms in up to 70% of cases. Several agents, including dexamethasone and antihistamines have been demonstrated to either increase the efficacy of metoclopramide or decrease the side effects. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, has both antiemetic and anxiolytic properties. It can be useful as an adjunct to metoclopramide-based therapy. We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of lorazepam in managing anticipatory, acute, and delayed emesis induced by high doses of cisplatin. A total of 180 events involving cisplatin administration (100 mg/m2 as a 24-hour continuous infusion) were randomized to receive metoclopramide along with dexamethasone and clemastine with and without lorazepam. Categorical scales were utilized to document the incidence of nausea and vomiting and side effects related to antiemetic therapy. All episodes are evaluable. Lorazepam significantly reduced the incidence of anticipatory nausea and vomiting (P<. 05) as well as acute emesis (P=. 05) induced by cisplatin. Delayed emesis was also decreased; however, it was statistically significant on day 3 only (P<. 05). Side effects were few except for mild sedation and amnesia, which were significantly more common in those receiving lorazepam (P<. 001).

Ninety percent patients reached up to term pregnancy between 37 to 40 weeks. Fibroids were found less common in patients in their first pregnancy (8, 23.66%). Twenty-one (70%) patients were delivered by caesarean section, and in 1 (3.33%) patient hysterotomy was performed. Failure to progress and foetal distress was the commonest indication for caesarean section (8, 38.09%) followed by breech presentation (4, 19.04%), cord prolapse (3, 14.28%) and fibroids in the lower segment (2, 9.52%). Anaemia was the commonest complication (20, 66.66%) followed by postpartum haemorrhage (PPH)(10, 33.33%). Breech presentation was the commonest malpresentation (4, 13.33%) associated with fibroids during pregnancy. Premature rupture of membranes and cord prolapse was seen in 3 (10%) patients each.

In the proposed wavelet-based PID controller, the discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose the error between actual and command speeds into different frequency components at various scales. The wavelet-transformed coefficients of different scales, which represent many underlying phenomena such as process dynamics, measurement noise, and effects of external disturbances, are scaled by their respective gains and, then, are added together to generate the control signal. The performance of this newly devised wavelet controller is evaluated in both simulation and experiments.

Methods: The coding region of each of the 16 positional candidate genes for which mutation screening has not been previously reported was screened with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and automated sequencing in four affected individuals from two families with SCCD. In addition, the coding region of UBIAD1, located just outside of the originally described SCCD candidate interval on chromosome 1p36, was directly sequenced in affected and unaffected individuals from three families with SCCD.Results: Eighteen novel and 15 previously reported sequence variants were identified in 10 of the 16 positional candidate genes. Only two of the sequence variants segregated with the affected phenotype in either of the families screened. Both were novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predicted to result in synonymous amino acid substitutions in different predicted genes. However, one of these SNPs was also identified in control individuals, and the other SNP was not predicted to alter splicing. Screening of UBIAD1 revealed a different missense mutation in each of the three unrelated probands that was screened: p. Asn102Ser, p. Arg119Gly, and p. Leu121Val.

Recently, a significant difference in the distribution of the codon 72 polymorphism of the tumor suppressor gene p53 between control subjects and POAG patients of Chinese origin (p= 0.00782) was demonstrated. The proline residue at codon 72 of the p53 gene was significantly over represented in the POAG patients relative to healthy controls. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the reported association between the p53 polymorphism and POAG is a common phenomenon irrespective of geographical location or ethnicity of the population.Methods: Sixty seven unrelated POAG patients, ranging from 10-65 years of age (mean\u00b1SD of 41.16\u00b118.52 years), and 112 control subjects having a similar age range of 18-63 years (mean\u00b1SD of 36.64\u00b114.65 years) were enrolled in this study.

Determination of the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of LIUS allows to optimize this technique as a therapy for the treatment of malignancies and aseptic inflammatory disorders. Methods: We conducted cutting-edge database mining approaches to determine the anti-inflammatory mechanisms exerted by LIUS. Results: Our data revealed following interesting findings: 1) LIUS anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by upregulating anti-inflammatory gene expression; 2) LIUS induces the upregulation of the markers and master regulators of immunosuppressor cells including MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells), MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells), B1-B cells and Treg (regulatory T cells); 3) LIUS not only can be used as a therapeutic approach to deliver drugs packed in various structures such as nanobeads, nanospheres, polymer microspheres, and lipidosomes, but also can make use of natural membrane vesicles as small as exosomes derived from immunosuppressor cells as a novel mechanism to fulfill its anti-inflammatory effects; 4) LIUS upregulates the expression of extracellular vesicle/ exosome biogenesis mediators and docking mediators; 5) Exosome-carried anti-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory microRNAs inhibit inflammation of target cells via multiple shared and specific pathways, suggesting exosome-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of LIUS feasible; and 6) LIUS-mediated physical effects on tissues may activate specific cellular sensors\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["1547"]}
{"title": "Response of maize grown under high plant density; performance, issues and management-a critical review\n", "abstract": " Modern cropping is based on relatively high plant density. The improved grain yield per unit area of modern maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids is due to the increased optimum plant population rather than the improved grain yield per plant. High plant density has been widely used to enhance grain yield in maize. Subsequently we review the effect of planting density on physiology, phenology, morphology, nitrogen use efficiency, water use efficiency grain yield information in maize crop. At higher plant populations reduced grain yield also results from the increased pollento-silking interval and the following barrenness. However, it may lead to higher risk lodging hence causing significant yield loss of the crop. Future insights are morphological and physiological basis controlling barren and stalk lodging resistance. How root traits, and anatomy of sheath and stem of maize plants correspond to high plant population and a further study on the physiological and biological basis of organ development that may govern the mechanisms of high plant density would be essential for future research.", "num_citations": "38\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

There are observations which are not consistent with the portrayal of the plasma steroid-binding proteins as solely passive reservoirs for the steroids which they bind.

The present research was conducted to evaluate five rice varieties for salinity tolerance at seedling stage.Methods: Experiment was conducted in triplicate and in two sets. One set was grown as a control (non-stress) and other as salt stressed. Salt stress of 15 dS/m was applied to one set of rice seedlings under controlled conditions. Data for different growth related morpho-physiological traits, ie germination percentage, root and shoot length, seedling fresh and dry weight, Na+ and K+ uptake were recorded after 15 days of seedling emergence under control as well as salinity condition.Results: Significant differences were observed among the genotypes under both the treatments and interaction of the evaluated traits suggested a significant variability among the rice genotypes under salt stress. NIAB-IRRI-9, Basmati-198 and KSK-133 were proved to be relatively salt tolerant varieties as they showed good performance for the recorded parameters. However, Basmati-385 was observed a salt sensitive variety due to highest reduction in seedling fresh and dry weight along with the maximum Na+ uptake.Conclusion: Based on obtained results, it was concluded that the evaluated morpho-physiological traits were useful to screen rice cultivars for salinity stress.

A major portion of the world buffalo milk production comes from the Asian subcontinent of India, and the devel-oped technologies are best suited for the manufacture of dairy products popular there. Owing to basic differences in composition and physico-chemical properties, when technologies developed for buffalo milk are applied to make westem-type dairy cow milk products, buffalo milk is often not regarded as a suitable raw material for such western dairy products. A thorough understanding of the properties of buffalo milk is necessary to help resolve problems encountered in the manufacture of dairy products with quality on a par with that from cow milk.", "num_citations": "33\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

It is not a history of the War, nor is it meant to be an analysis of events leading up to it.

The book was originally written soon after the War in 1966 and 1967. At that time I was fully occupied as the Chief Executive of an expanding airline. Since leaving the airline and my other government responsibilities in mid-1968, I have been involved in politics, which has kept me busy ever since. Thus I have had insufficient time, until the present, to see to the publication of this book. The time I spent in prison at Kot Lakhpat, Sahiwal and Sihala and my detention at Murree during 1977 provided me an opportunity to complete this work. I am grateful to Admiral Muzaffar Hassan, who was the Chief of Naval Operations in 1965, for assistance in writing about the role of the Pakistan Navy during this conflict. Except for the inclusion of Chapter XII'A Visit to Peking', which has been written subsequently, I have left the original untouched. However, I have omitted certain opinions and details which I consider inexpedient to publish at this stage.

However, the link between the two is poorly understood. The findings reviewed here demonstrate that amlodipine has membrane-modifying and antioxidant actions at the cell membrane level in addition to its classical calcium channel blocking properties. These multiple pharmacologic actions may explain the cellular mechanisms of the atheroprotective effects of amlodipine in spontaneous atherogenesis and in accelerated atherosclerotic syndromes.

In this work, seeds of Albizia lebbeck and Melia azedarach trees were converted into activated carbon adsorbents and applied for the adsorptive removal of Pb and Cd metals from an aqueous solution. The as prepared adsorbents were characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The removal efficiencies of both metals were strongly dependent on their initial concentration, contact time, pH, temperature and the quantity of adsorbents. 0.2 g of both adsorbents removed respectively 75 and 62% Pb and 77 and 66% Cd from from 100 ml of a 40 mg/l concentrated solution in 120 min at pH 5 and a temperature of 20 C.

Results showed that in the first growing season (2007-08), the combination of 3 kg ha-1 HA with half (30: 20 kg ha-1) rate of NP produced the highest grain yield (1314 kg ha-1) and increased the yield by 46.9% over the control.

It is basically a tax on final consumption integrates the union excise duties, custom duties, services tax and state VAT. Presently around 140 countries have adopted the GST pattern, including India. The GST would be beneficial for the consumers as it reduces the final burden of taxation. For Government it leads the reduction of tax compliance efforts and administrative costs and for business units it leads transparency, complete set-off and removal of cascading effect of taxation. It is in this background that the present paper tries to explain the significance of GST in India and its prospects for states to generate revenue and ensure transparency in tax structure. This paper is organized into seven sections. Section two presents justification for dual structure of GST in India. The third part presents the rate structure under GST work in India. The fourth segment is concerned with the working of GST in India. The fifth part shows the international experiences of GST at state level in India.

Conventional controllers can become even unstable, with these parametric uncertainties. This problem can be avoided by using robust and adaptive control design techniques. However, to obtain robust performance, it is desirable that the closed-loop poles of the perturbed structural system remain at prespecified locations for a range of system parameters. With the aim to obtain robust performance by manipulating the closed loop poles of the perturbed system, feasibility of the pole placement based controller design techniques is checked for active vibration control applications. The controllers based on the adaptive and robust pole placement method are implemented on smart structures.

People migrate from one place to another for the development of their overall living standard and to enhance their social position. This study tries to determine the factors of internal migration and assesses its impact on socio-economic status of migrants. Descriptive research design has been followed in this study. Social survey technique and Focused Group Discussion (FGD) have been applied to collect pertinent data. To analyze the collected data Economic Status Index (ESI), Social Status Index (SSI), Head Count Ratio (HCR) and Poverty Gap Ratio (PGR) were calculated. Area under Sylhet City Corporation, Bangladesh, where people have been migrating from different district of Bangladesh, has been considered as the area of this study. The study reveals that, people were pushed in Sylhet city because of their poor socio-economic conditions, mainly poverty condition. Besides, many pull factors also attract them to migrate in this city. It is found from the study that, internal migration is positively contributed to the development of poor people. There social and economic condition as household income, saving, land possession, expenditure, non-productive assets, housing status, water & sanitation facilities, treatment aptitudes, social participation etc. especially their poverty condition is improved in comparison to the same factors before migration. In a word, internal migration (rural to urban) contributes to the improvement of the socio-economic status of the migrants.", "num_citations": "28\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

{"title": "Scale and rotation invariant recognition of cursive Pashto script using SIFT features\n", "abstract": " Cursive scripts such as Urdu, Pashto and Arabic contain large number of unique shapes called ligatures. Recognition of thousands of ligatures is challenging due to variations of various kinds including scaling, orientation, font style, spatial location/registration of ligatures and limited number of samples available for training. Accurate segmentation is a key challenge for analytic approaches, whereas holistic approaches suffer due to limitations of various feature representation schemes. In this paper, the use of SIFT descriptor has been proposed to evaluate its effectiveness for representing Pashto ligatures while overcoming above mentioned challenges in a holistic framework. The proposed approach is script independent and can be easily adapted to other cursive languages.

Among 113 patients, 51 cases were found to have sarcoidosis, 44 of them had SACE levels greater than 52 lU/L (mean ACE 104.44). SACE levels were also found elevated in other clinical conditions like tuberculosis (mean 58.64 lUlL), but the enzyme level were less (p0. 04) than those found in sarcoidosis (mean (92-97 lUlL). SACE activity was found to be considerably lower in other chronic lung diseases such as, fibrosing alveolitis (mean 43.98 lUlL), interstitial lung disease (mean 42.11 lU/L) and chronic obstructive lung disease (mean 40.85 lUlL). Twenty patients of sarcoidosis, who received steroid tretalment subsequently showed a decline in the SACE levels. SACE is a useful marker in differential diagnosis as 37.2% cases of sarcoidosis compared to only 9.09% of tuberculosis had SACE levels greater than 100 lUlL. In addition, our data also suggest that serum ACE is useful for the diagnosis as well as monitoring prognosis in sarcoidosis (JPMA 48: 131, 1998).", "num_citations": "27\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

{"title": "Histone acetyltransferase KAT8 is essential for mouse oocyte development by regulating reactive oxygen species levels\n", "abstract": " Proper oocyte development is crucial for female fertility and requires timely and accurate control of gene expression. K (lysine) acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), an important component of the X chromosome dosage compensation system in Drosophila, regulates gene activity by acetylating histone H4 preferentially at lysine 16. To explore the function of KAT8 during mouse oocyte development, we crossed Kat8flox/flox mice with Gdf9-Cre mice to specifically delete Kat8 in oocytes. Oocyte Kat8 deletion resulted in female infertility, with follicle development failure in the secondary and preantral follicle stages. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Kat8 deficiency in oocytes results in significant downregulation of antioxidant genes, with a consequent increase in reactive oxygen species. Intraperitoneal injection of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine rescued defective follicle and oocyte development resulting from Kat8 deficiency\u00a0\u2026", "num_citations": "24\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

Solanum nigrum (commonly called Makoi) is also a medicinal plant. A dietary intake of Solanum nigrum supplies our body with nutrients that offer protection against numerous diseases. All parts of this plant are used in the traditional medicine as a remedy for treating various diseases like, cough, cold, asthma, skin diseases and liver problem. Now a day, Diabetes mellitus has become a real problem of public health in developing countries. This is a metabolic disorder characterized by disarrangements in carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism caused by the complete or relative insufficiency of insulin secretion and/or action. This is due to defective or deficient insulin secretary response. This results into impaired glucose use, which is a characteristic feature of diabetes mellitus ie resultant hyperglycemia. Elevated blood glucose level causes dehydration of the tissue cells as glucose does not diffuse easily through the pores of cell membrane and increased osmotic pressure. Present investigation is therefore designed to determine the effect of crude ethanolic extract of S. nigrum on blood sugar of albino rat after daily oral administration of dose at the level of 250mg/kg b. wt. for five and seven days respectively. It was noticed that the chronic administration for longer duration leads to significant decrease in blood sugar compared to control.

{"title": "Physiology, parathyroid hormone (PTH)\n", "abstract": " In the blood, the sensitive process of calcium and phosphate homeostasis is maintained primarily by an appropriately functioning parathyroid gland. The parathyroid gland is comprised of 4 small glands located posteriorly to the thyroid in the middle aspect of the anterior neck. The parathyroid gland secretes parathyroid hormone (PTH), a polypeptide, in response to low calcium levels detected in the blood. PTH facilitates the synthesis of active vitamin D, calcitriol (1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D) in the kidneys. In conjunction with calcitriol, PTH regulates calcium and phosphate. PTH effects are present in the bones, kidneys, and small intestines. As serum calcium levels drop, secretion of PTH by the parathyroid gland increases. Increased calcium levels in the serum serve as a negative-feedback loop signaling the parathyroid glands to stop the release of PTH. The mechanism of PTH in the body is intricate, and the clinical ramifications of irregularities are significant. The understanding of PTH is of paramount relevance and importance.[1][2][3][4]", "num_citations": "20\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

Various doses (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg) of Free or Lip-TQ were administered in C. albicans infected diabetic mice. The effect of Lip-TQ was also determined on the organ indices, liver and kidney function parameters. Lip-TQ at a dose of 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the level of the blood glucose and alleviated the systemic C. albicans infection in diabetic mice. C. albicans infected diabetic mice treated with Lip-TQ at a dose of 10 mg/kg showed the survival rate of 70% as compared to that of 20% in the group treated with free TQ. The treatment with Lip-TQ resulted in the recovery of the organ indices, liver inflammation, kidney functioning and pancreas regeneration in diabetic mice. Moreover, TQ formulations also showed the direct therapeutic effect against candidiasis in the untreated or metformin-treated diabetic mice. Therefore, the findings of the present study support the use of Lip-TQ in the treatment of candidiasis in the diabetic patients.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

Treatment of this clinical condition is controversial. Previously, hysterectomy was the mainstay of treatment, but in the recent past various conservative management approaches have been applied to preserve fertility. We report 2 such cases in which conservative approach was implemented. CASES: Case 1 was an early, nonviable cervical pregnancy in which systemic methotrexate was used with success. Case 2 was a viable, advanced cervical pregnancy (at 11 weeks) in which a combination of uterine artery embolization and systemic methotrexate was used. Ultimately this patient required hysterectomy due to sudden massive hemorrhage on day 22 of intervention. CONCLUSION: On reviewing our results and the literature, we conclude that uterine artery embolization with methotrexate is effective in reducing the ectopic cervical mass. However, there is always a risk of hemorrhage, which can be treated by either repeat uterine artery embolization alone or uterine artery embolization followed by curettage.

Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) has been widely used in the treatment of HCC, but patients eventually develop resistance. ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier (ISG15) is a ubiquitin-like protein transcriptionally regulated by IFN-\u03b1 which shows antivirus and antitumor activities. However, the exact role of ISG15 is unknown. In the present study, we showed that IFN-\u03b1 significantly induced ISG15 expression but failed to induce HepG2 cell apoptosis, whereas transient overexpression of ISG15 dramatically increased HepG2 cell apoptosis. ISG15 overexpression increased overall protein ubiquitination, which was not observed in cells with IFN-\u03b1-induced ISG15 expression, suggesting that IFN-\u03b1 treatment not only induced the expression of ISG15 but also inhibited ISG15-mediated ubiquitination. The tumor suppressor p53 and p21 proteins are the key regulators of cell survival and death in response to stress signals such as DNA damage. We showed that p53 or p21 is only up regulated in HepG2 cells ectopically expressing ISG15, but not in the presence of IFN-\u03b1-induced ISG15. Our results suggest that ISG15 overexpression could be developed into a powerful gene-therapeutic tool for treating IFN-\u03b1-resistant HCC.", "num_citations": "18\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

Herbs and spices have offered an excellent, important and useful source of antimicrobial agents against many pathological infections. In the current study, the antimicrobial potency of fresh, naturally and commercial dried Allium sativum and Zingiber officinale extracts had been investigated against seven local clinical bacterial isolates such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Serratia marcesnces by the agar disc diffusion method. All tested pathogens except P. aeruginosa and E. coli were most susceptible to ethanolic and methanolic extracts of A. sativum. Similarly, chloroform and diethyl ether extracts of Z. officinale showed a greater zone of inhibition of tested pathogens except for P. aeruginosa and E. coli. We found that all extracts of A. sativum and Z. officinale have a strong antibacterial effect compared to recommended standard antibiotics through activity index. All results were evaluated statistically and a significant difference was recorded at P< 0.05. Antioxidant activity of extracts showed that 10 out of 13 extracts have high scavenging potential. Thin layer chromatography profiling of all extracts of A. sativum and Z. officinale proposed the presence of various phytochemicals such as tannins, phenols, alkaloids, steroids and saponins. Retention factor of diverse phytochemicals provides a valuable clue regarding their polarity and the selection of solvents for separation of phytochemicals.

{"title": "Prediction of potato late blight disease based upon environmental factors in Faisalabad\n", "abstract": " Potato late blight (PLB) caused by Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, is an important and serious threat to successful potato production in the world. It spreads through seed and soil residual material. In Pakistan, PLB disease can induce 100% yield losses under epidemic condition. Due to lack of resistance in indigenous potato germplasm, disease is managed through fungicides by the growers of Pakistan. Excessive use of fungicides causes resistance in the pathogen and creates fatalistic effect on the environment. Disease predictive model under such situation may be effective tool to predict early onset of disease. A disease predictive model was developed on two years data of PLB disease severity and epidemiological factors using stepwise regression analysis. Model explained upto 80% disease variability. Maximum and Minimum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed appeared to be most significant factors in the PLB disease development. The environmental conditions conducive for the development of PLB disease were characterized. Maximum and minimum temperatures in the range of 16-20 C and 1-6 C were found favourable for potato blight disease.

The lattice parameters of the samples were determined from the X-ray diffraction data using Nelson-Riley extrapolation method. It was found that the lattice parameter decreased with increasing Cr concen- tration obeying Vegard\u2019s law. Magnetic properties of the samples were measured using an Impedance Analyzer. Real and imaginary parts of the complex permeability, loss factor and quality factor were measured as the function of frequency at three different sintering temperatures 1250?C, 1300?C and 1350?C for all the samples in the frequency range 1 kHz to 13 MHz. Frequency stability of the real part of permeability increases with increasing Cr concentration and also with sintering temperature. Imaginary part of permeability decreases with increasing frequency and increased with increasing both of the Cr content and sintering temperature. Loss factor decreased with increasing frequency while the quality factor (Q) increased with increasing frequency for all the samples. The temperature de- pendence of initial permeability was measured for all the samples sintered at 1300?C. The Curie temperature (Tc) was determined from the -T curves.

Furthermore, both algorithms are tested using entropy curves and results show that OIBDH has lower absolute entropy difference compared to Bit Plane Splicing LSB technique in all the tested images.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1547"]}
{"title": "Implementation of wavelet-based controller for battery storage system of hybrid electric vehicles\n", "abstract": " This paper presents a wavelet-based multiresolution proportional integral derivative (MRPID) controller for temperature control of the ambient air of battery storage system of the hybrid electric vehicles. In the proposed wavelet MRPID controller, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to decompose temperature error into frequency components at various resolution of the error signal. The wavelet transformed coefficients are scaled by suitable gains and then added together to generate the control signal of thermal system. The proposed wavelet controller is implemented for battery storage system in both simulation and experiments. The digital signal processor board is used for real-time implementation of the proposed controller. The performance of the proposed wavelet-based MRPID controller is compared with conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and adaptive neural network controllers.

{"title": "Discrete wavelet transform based detection of disturbances in induction motors\n", "abstract": " In this work, two discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based algorithms, which have both a detection and classification phase, are developed for diagnosing and detecting various disturbances occurring in three-phase induction motors. In the first approach, the criterion for the detection phase is the comparison of the DWT coefficients of fault currents using the selected mother wavelet `db3' at the sixth level of resolution with a threshold determined experimentally during healthy condition of the motor. A feature vector representing the second norm of details of fault currents of six levels of resolution is used to discriminate between different faults. The second approach is based on the comparison of modulus maxima of the DWT coefficients for fault detection. The classification of faults is based on localized parameters estimation.

Electron microscopic studies show that PbCrO4 is phagocytosed by HOS cells and accumulates within the vacuoles in the cytoplasm. A number of cell lines have been isolated following multiple treatment of HOS cells with PbCrO4. These cell lines are morphologically different from HOS cells, form anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar and form quickly regressing small tumor nodules in athymic nude mice. The cellular and secreted plasminogen activator (PA) levels of 5 cell lines isolated after PbCrO4 treatment are increased up to 8 fold and up to 10 fold respectively as compared to untreated HOS controls. SDS-PAGE analysis in the presence of copolymerized substrates is consistent with increase in 55 kDa urokinase-type PA (u-PA) and 68 kDa tissue-type PA (t-PA).

All soils sampled were calcareous and contained variable amounts of organic matter. Though a large number of crop species were sampled, no Mn deficiency symptoms were apparent, while Mn contents, which varied with the crop, were considered adequate by accepted criteria. A relatively small percentage of the soils extracted with NH4OAC, NH4H2PO4, and MgCl2 were considered deficient while none were deficient according to criteria for the DTPA extract. All availability indices showed Mn to increase with O.M. content but decrease with CaCO3 content. Availability was lowest in the drier Beka's Valley where O.M. was low and CaCO3 high. Inclusion of pH and CaCO3 in multiple regression analysis generally improved prediction of Mn uptake for all tests.", "num_citations": "16\n", "authors": ["1547"]}

Subjects carrying c.[769-784C> T; 5603A> T] were clinically compared with a STGD1 cohort previously published carrying c. 5603A> T noncomplex. We calculated the penetrances of the intronic variants using ABCA4 allele frequency data of the general population and investigated the effect of c. 769-784C> T on splicing in photoreceptor progenitor cells (PPCs).Results: Mostly, late-onset, foveal-sparing STGD1 was observed among subjects harboring c. 769-784C> T or c. 4253+ 43G> A (median age of onset, 54.5 and 52.0 years, respectively). However, ages of onset, phenotypes in fundo, and visual acuity courses varied widely. No significant clinical differences were observed between the c.[769-784C> T; 5603A> T] cohort and the c. 4253+ 43G> A or the c. 5603A> T cohort.

To make people easier and faster to utilize the service resources, it becomes more and more important to gather the services on the IoT. Most of the current methods can only create automatic or semi-automatic service composition schemes, and lack support and consideration of real-time data and instant situation information, so they cannot achieve dynamic adaptive aggregation of services. In this paper, we focus on both the functional and non-functional constrains, and propose an IoT service aggregation method based on dynamic planning oriented QoE constraint. Firstly, the knowledge model of relationship among service category concepts are constructed.
